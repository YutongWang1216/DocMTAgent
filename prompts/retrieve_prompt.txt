You are a linguistic expert. Given a list of sentences and a query, your task is to find the {top_num} sentences in the list that are most relevant to the request.

Sentence list:

Note that you should only respond with a list containing the numbers of these {top_num} sentences. For example, if you choose sentences {example_number} as your answer, your response should be "{example_list}".
