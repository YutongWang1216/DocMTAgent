Chapter 1: New Journey
The wind blew through the canyon and set off waves to the prairie.
The wild cows that were bowing to eat the green grass looked up towards the sky. 
There, a ten-meter long wooden merchant ship was floating in the air. The ship moved forward slowly as the sail bellied with the wind.
“No matter how you see it, this scenery sure is a magnificent one.”
A middle-aged man in leather armor stood next to the deck, looking down at the endless grassland and its beauty.
“For us merchants, this is also a rare opportunity.”
Standing next to the middle-aged man was a slightly overweight merchant. He had a weird curly hair and was wearing a merchant’s robe. His small eyes were slightly narrowed as if he was planning something while gazing at the scenery in front of him. Looking at him, it was as if he was thinking that the beautiful scenery in front of him could be sold.
“If it were not for this thing, I am afraid we won’t be able to move the goods into the central area this quickly.”
“To be honest, I always opposed the idea of opening a market, but now it seems that my choice was correct.”
“Please forgive me for being frank, but if you do not choose a wider route, even if we went from here, although it will save more time, the degree of danger will also increase.”
“I heard that the other side is not quiet, and I think you have also listened to the captain’s reminder that it seems there were Wind Serpents around here recently, what if…”
The man’s face darkened. He turned his head, shifting his sight to somewhere not far from the mountains. 
Towering peaks blocked his line of sight, making him unable to see what was behind. 
But he could faintly perceive that the distant sky was not pure blue, and there was a touch of cloudy darkness.
That’s not the world they should get involved with.
“Do not worry, how can there be so many ifs? Money comes from danger. This is the reason why I spend so much money to hire you!”
“Only a few serpents, is that not it?”
The merchant stretched out his hand and patted the man’s shoulder.
“Yes, what about the condition of the young man we saved?”
“Is he still alive?”
“Lize has bandaged his wound, and now he is sleeping. His condition supposedly will not be life-threatening.”
“That’s good.”
Hearing the man’s answer, the merchant nodded with satisfaction, but then he quickly frowned.
“But what kind of wound is that from? Looking at the wound, it seems like it was from a big lizard, but is there anything like that in the north of Paphield?”
“I do not know, Lord, but it’s supposedly a very ferocious beast. I hope we do not run into them.”
While talking, the man’s eyes subconsciously swept the entrance of the cabin, then he turned his head again, looking forward.
Rhode opened his eyes.
W-what happened?
He stared at the ceiling; his brain was dizzy. 
He remembered that he had been leading his team to fight the most powerful boss in the Dragon Soul Continent, the Void Dragon, and had successfully gotten the first kill. He was sure that he had got the achievement and system prompt, but then, the Void Dragon’s last attack also took his life away.
According to his plan, Rhode should’ve respawned and then he would log out. 
But the moment he was killed by the Void Dragon, his whole vision immediately become dark, as if he was forced to log off. Then he lost his consciousness.
How can this be? 
Did I encounter a bug in the game?
Rhode could barely turn his head, but he still managed to catch a glimpse of the blue azure sky and white clouds outside. Where is he? 
What’s this place?
What happened? 
Is he dreaming? 
Or is he still in the game? 
At least he was sure that this place wasn’t his small rental apartment. 
Doubts immediately flooded his mind. Then, Rhode frowned and tried to get up.
“Ugh!”
Suddenly, he felt an acute pain from his chest. He bit his lips and stopped moving. 
He found that his left shoulder and chest had been completely wrapped by a bandage. Although he did not know what happened, judging from the blood stain that permeated it, it seemed that his injury was quite severe.
This is definitely not a game.
Rhode was undoubtedly certain of this. He knew that although the current technology was quite advanced, and as the world’s first virtual reality game, Dragon Soul Continent Online had also used a lot of high-tech technology, but according to the rules, it was impossible for the player to experience pain. The reason was so that people could distinguish between reality and the game. 
Also, for the sake of the players, they had to reduce the pain threshold. If the player was injured, instead of pain, the game would reduce the player’s speed and use red color to block the player’s line of sight. It was done so to warn and remind them, rather than the real simulation of pain. 
When the virtual reality simulation technology first appeared in the world, it had caused a lot of controversies. Dragon Soul Continent’s operating company naturally knew it too.
Rhode lowered his head and looked at his right hand. Its shape was not like his character from the game; his body was not that full of muscle nor was it mighty. 
On the contrary, the arm in front of him was small and thin. Since he had almost never exposed himself to the sunlight, his skin was a little bit pale. 
This was definitely his own body; he was sure of it.
However, how did he get hurt? 
Was this place a hospital? 
Rhode scanned his surroundings; the whole room looked like a cabin—no lights, no phone, no call bell. 
A wooden table, two chairs and a fixed cabinet on the wall were the only things in the room. 
He did not know why, but he felt like he had seen this somewhere.
While he was studying the room carefully, the door suddenly opened.
A blonde girl wearing a white robe entered the room. She looked at Rhode who was half-sitting in surprise, with her eyes wide open.
“You have woken up? That’s great!!”
The girl did not speak Chinese or English, but he seemed to be able to clearly understand it. 
He could not help but feel a little bit surprised because he knew the language too.
This is the Nimus language, one of the official language in the Dragon Soul Continent!
“How are you feeling?”
However, the girl did not care about Rhode’s expression. She quickly went to his side, carefully checking his left shoulder and chest.
“Your injury is really serious. Frankly, I was worried whether you would survive or not…”
“This is…”
He frowned but did not know what to say. He turned his head, looking at the mirror next to the wall where a clear reflection of his face could be seen. It was indeed his face, no doubt about it, but it was not supposed to appear here.
“Did you forget?”
The blonde girl curiously blinked her eyes, her twin tails following her movement. Her blue eyes were clear and transparent, exuding a cheerful disposition.
“Two days ago, you fell in the middle of the Paphield Plains and suffered a very serious injury.”
“If it was not because of the Silver Libra’s merchant guild floating ship passing by, I am afraid it would be even worse.” 
“I do not know what kind of monster you fought against, but the left side of your body received a very serious injury. It can be really dangerous.”
Wait, left shoulder…
Rhode froze in surprise for a moment. He immediately thought about the last battle with the Void Dragon before, wasn’t it his left shoulder that was attacked? 
But it was his game avatar that was injured, and there was supposed to be no connection to the player itself, right? But now, the one who got injured was him?
Although the situation in front of him was a mess, Rhode still quickly calmed down. As the top player and the world strongest guild leader, he had a strong mentality, and in the middle of the conversation with the blonde girl in front of him, he had also learned about his current situation. 
He was seriously injured in the Paphield Plains, and Silver Libra Merchant Guild floating ship happened to pass by, so they saved him. 
According to what the blonde girl had said, his condition was pretty bad, but his ability to recover was pretty good.
“My name is Lize Noir, I am a member of the Crescent Star mercenary group. I am a Cleric. You can just call me Lize.”
The girl straightforwardly introduced herself to Rhode.
“I’m Rhode Alander.”
Even though he still could not completely sort out the situation, he hesitated for a moment, but he still told her his ID from the game.
“I am an adventurer from the Eastern Plains.”
“So you are an adventurer, that was why you were alone in the vast mountain.”
After hearing Rhode’s answer, Lize did not feel surprised because, in this continent, there were many adventurers who liked to explore alone, so Rhode’s identity was not much of a problem.
“But what kind of thing did you fight with actually?”
”How did you get such a serious injury?“ 
“I remember that there should be no high leveled monsters in particular in the plains.”
Hearing her inquiry, Rhode showed a bitter smile. 
What could he say? Should he say that he was injured because he fought one of the five creator dragons, the Void Dragon?
“I did not see what it was because I was attacked at night. There were a lot of them and they were very quick. I think that maybe they were things from ‘the other side’.”
“I understand.”
Although Rhode did not elaborate, Lize seemed to know what it was and nodded. By then, she had also finished checking at Rhode’s wound, so she stood up.
“You have not eaten for two days, so you must be hungry. Please wait. I will get some food for you to eat.”
“Ah, yes, I would like to report this matter to my leader, I think he will come to see you soon.”
Having said that, she nodded towards him politely and then left the room.

Chapter 1064: The End of Arrow
Under the suppression of mortars, the military base was in chaos. No one noticed a special force team sneaking in.
Without expending extra effort, Kutpov placed a beacon on the target then withdrew from the base with the team. After they safely arrived at the evacuation point, they called for an airstrike.
Soon, the Russian stealth bomber whizzed through the clouds, and the four bombs landed precisely on the two ammunition depots and two fuel depots at the base. 
The shock wave of the explosion was sent through the entire base and collapsed the concrete buildings around the points of impact.
The exploded ammunition and burning fireballs were sent scattering across the camp and caused a series of chain explosions. Flames, blood, and corpses were everywhere. 
The guards stationed at the base suffered severe casualties, and the rest were injured.
Medical soldiers with stretchers rushed inside the base. They searched for the wounded and immobilized. 
The engineer soldiers with heavy explosion-proof suits rushed into the flames to pull out any unexploded ammunition from the ruins. 
All the soldiers who could still move began to mobilize while they searched for their missing team members.
Sardes looked at the fire outside the window, and despair gradually appeared in his blank pupils.
Smoke covered the entire base. Flame stained the entire night sky red. The scene resembled doomsday.
“Sh*t…” 
Sardes muttered to himself. He moved his heavy legs and slowly left the window.
When he turned around, his eyes met his advisor’s eyes.
“Sir, what should we do?”
The explosion finally stopped. There were no more chain reactions at the base. However, nobody could be calmed. The mercenaries who escaped from the explosion knew it was just the beginning of their nightmare.
The previous explosion seemed to ignite a signal and signaled an attack from the Sami Army. 
Under the orders of Jiang Chen, Sami seized this fleeting opportunity. He jumped in front of everyone and brought all the remaining refugees to the frontlines.
More than six thousand people charged into the tundra, into the burning pines.
It was a spectacular scene.
At the same time, looking at the smoke rising from behind the base, all the mercenaries fighting on the front lines were panicking. Their previously-boosted morale dropped to rock-bottom in an instant. 
Even if they could defend their position, they were unwilling to fight.
Without any suspense, Arrow’s defense line was penetrated, and the uncooperative mercenaries collapsed in front of the Sami Army. 
Some of them fled back to the burning base, but most of them deserted and fled deep into the woods.
Jiang Chen didn’t need to remind them since even a pig would know what to do next.
Jiang Chen watched as Sami began to launch an attack on the military base then he put away his binoculars. He took out an off-road motorcycle from the storage dimension and patted Ayesha’s back gently.
“It’s time, let’s go.”
“Mhmm!”
Ayesha nodded, and after Jiang Chen sat on the motorcycle, she also hopped on behind him.
The engine roared and the belt shattered the snow.
Jiang Chen rushed down the hillside and turned to the side of the military base. He then parked the motorcycle on the side, took out a laser sword from the storage dimension, and stroked it in his hand. The barbed fence was shredded easily.
The entire base was immersed in fire and chaos, and there were still explosions from mortars from time to time. All the mercenaries fought on the front line and fought with the refugees for control of the entrance. 
Except for a company guarding the command center, no one was in the rear.
For Jiang Chen and Ayesha, it was no different than having no defense.
A total of ten guards—two guards standing in the sentry tower, and the remaining eight were stationed at the entrance of the first and second floors. 
Ayesha took out the Ghost Sniper Rifle and quietly took down the two guards standing in the tower then used blind spots in their field of vision to kill the eight people upstairs and downstairs one by one.
When Ayesha took care of the guards, Jiang Chen took out a rifle and moved to the command center. Just as he passed the Hummer at the entrance, he just happened to bump into Sardes and his advisor fleeing.
When their eyes met, both sides stopped.
The advisor first responded and immediately pulled out his gun, but he didn’t reach them in time before Ayesha pinned him down. 
Sardes was trying to resist but was easily controlled by Jiang Chen and his hands were pinned against the Hummer.
“Sardes, male, 43.” 
“The general manager of Arrow and the highest commander. Am I right?”
Although it was the first time they were meeting, Jiang Chen’s holographic helmet, which was connected to the Ghost Agent’s database, stored photos and personal information related to Sardes.
His information was projected onto the holographic screen.
Sardes’ face was pressed against the hood of the vehicle. He was certainly tough as he was reluctant to surrender. He gnashed his teeth.
“I won’t say anything. Just kill me…”
“Kill you?” 
“I didn’t ask anything yet.”
Jiang Chen grinned and smiled. He didn’t care about Sardes’ uncooperative attitude. Jiang Chen freed his right hand, pulled out a needle and injected it into Sardes’ back.
“AHHHH!”
Sardes growled in resistance. His eyes began to look bloodshot, and soon, the light in his pupils faded. 
Jiang Chen simply let his hands go. No ordinary person could resist the truth-telling serum.
Jiang Chen turned Sardes around and asked one word at a time.
“Where is Carmen?”
“Underground research institute in the underground bunker…”
“Where is the underground bunker?”
“The entrance is in the middle of the base and can only be accessed through the elevator.” 
“There are two aprons next to the entrance.”
Jiang Chen soon got the information he wanted.
“Good, now your wish has been granted.”
Jiang Chen took out a pistol and ended him then tossed his body aside.
It was a quick way to die, but for the well-known Arrow general manager Mr. Sardes, death in this obscure form might be more painful than death itself… if the dead felt pain.
“The underground bunker?”
Looking at the center of the base, Jiang Chen sneered.
No matter what Carmen was plotting, his good fortune should be over. 
The fate of the Rothschild family would end as it began, fame because of a war, obscurity because of a war…
However, at that moment, there were fierce screams from the distance.

Chapter 1303: I Only Want You (1)
“What are you people doing!?!” 
Old Mr. Donggong hollered angrily while knocking his walking stick against the ground.
“Our ancestor is almost here. Mr. Donggong, please don’t get too impatient. You’ll find out what we’re going to do soon enough.”
Old Mr. Donggong knew exactly who “ancestor” referred to.
He was at a sudden loss for what to do, and he had no idea why Pei Yi was here.
It was not a wise decision to go against the DK Organization. Although everyone in R Nation wanted to annihilate them, it was practically impossible.
It was a far-fetched idea.
A few minutes later, Pei Yi’s car arrived.
He alighted from his car and shifted his gaze onto the car that An Xiaoning was in.
An Xiaoning alighted from the car without removing her wig or mask.
Wu Lianzhi followed suit.
“You’re here,” said An Xiaoning.
Pei Yi scanned her from head to toe and chuckled before walking toward her. He inched even closer toward her and said softly, “I doubt those people can recognize you under this disguise.”
“Of course. I did this just so they wouldn’t find out my identity. It’s not yet time for me to reveal my identity. That’s the reason I got you to come here.”
Pei Yi glanced at Wu Lianzhi and asked An Xiaoning, “Why are you with him?”
“For some issue.”
He stood up straight, turned around, and said to the members of the Donggong family with a smile, “Just what did my younger sister do to your family? Why did you have the audacity to try and kill her?” 
“Are you people tired of living?”
The members of the Donggong family turned pale the instant that they heard his words. Pei Yi’s sister? 
Since when did he have a sister?
Old Mrs. Donggong said, “We really had no idea… that she’s Mr. Pei’s sister.”
“I’m telling you now that she’s my sister.” 
“Did you hear me?” Pei Yi said coldly.
“Since you’ve said that she’s your sister, please take her away, Mr. Pei. As for Donggong Lianzhi, he’s a member of my family and his name is registered on my family’s ancestral records. He’s still part of the Donggong family, so it’s up to us to decide what to do with him.”
Before Pei Yi answered, the quick-witted An Xiaoning hurriedly said, “Brother, he’s my boyfriend and I’m carrying his child now. We can’t abandon him.”
Pei Yi initially wanted to take only An Xiaoning away, but things turned out to be trickier than what he had expected.
However, there was nothing the tyrannical Pei Yi couldn’t do, as long as he wanted to do it.
“Old Lady, you heard her. This man… could be considered as my brother-in-law now. They already have a child now. If I let you guys have him, wouldn’t the child be fatherless?” 
“Do you think I’d agree to that?”
Old Mrs. Donggong knew clearly that if she were to let Pei Yi take Wu Lianzhi away, it would be impossible for her to get rid of her grandson openly from now on. Hence, she refused to budge, despite fearing the DK’s authority and power.
“Mr. Pei, I’m afraid we can’t let you have him. Our family has our own set of rules. No outsiders are allowed to intervene when we’re punishing the members of our family.”
“Like I said, he’s the father of my sister’s child. Are you deaf?” 
Pei Yi then looked at Wu Lianzhi and said, “Are you a member of the Donggong family?”
“When my mother delivered some poisoned dishes to me this morning, I had already severed all ties with her. Prior to this, the Donggong family tried to kill me, Ms. An, and her subordinates under the facade of it being an accident. I already knew then that I’m no longer a member of the Donggong family, although it says so in the official records. My last name is now ‘Wu.’ My name is Wu Lianzhi. I no longer belong to the Donggong family!”
His words were cold, harsh, and full of impact.
The fact that he had the courage to make such a declaration in front of everyone just went to show that he was determined to cut ties with his family.
Old Mrs. Donggong barked, “It’s not your call! Once you’ve become a member of the Donggong family, you always will be!”
“Old Mrs. Donggong, may I ask you something? Now that Ms. An is already aware of your attempt to kill her, aren’t you afraid that she would intervene too?” 
Wu Lianzhi said dauntlessly in an austere tone.
Pei Yi smiled and chimed in, “I do know Ms. An personally, and she’s definitely one to take revenge where it’s due. You guys tried to kill her. Do you think she would take it lying down?”
“Okay, enough with the crap. My time is precious. I’m taking both of them away with me.”
Noticing that the members of the Donggong family were about to speak again, he added, “You should know what to do if you don’t want there to be any bloodshed.”
Hence, the Donggong family watched as their meticulously-premeditated plan backfired.
Old Mr. and Mrs. Donggong were beyond exasperated.
Finally, Old Mrs. Donggong said, “Forget it, forget it. We’ll just remove his name from the family records and the household register!”
“We have to go back to S Nation.”
Pei Yi gave her the side-eye and gibed, “Are you burning the bridge after you crossed over it?”
“Didn’t you say that you’d promise me something? I haven’t even informed you of my request and yet you’re already intending to return to your country?”
“I just have something important to handle back home, but I meant it when I said that I would agree to one of your requests. Tell me, what do you have in mind?”
“Hmm, my request might put you in a difficult spot…”
“Don’t bring it up, then. Give me another request that won’t put me in a spot.”
Pei Yi turned to look at her and said, “You really haven’t changed at all. Accompany me for half a month.”
“How?”
“Like you used to in the past.”
Gazing at him, An Xiaoning refused, “That can’t do. Firstly, I don’t want to be chained and have my freedom restricted. Two weeks is too long. I’m fine with two days.”
The smile on Pei Yi’s face stiffened a little and he chastised, “You’re going overboard with the bargaining. Five days, no fewer than that. Since you agreed to let me make my request, you can’t go back on your word. I’ll definitely let you have your freedom.”
“Can you let me return home first, then?”
“No.”
After hearing their conversation, Wu Lianzhi could not help but wonder, Are they in a relationship?
Is it a complicated one?
Why does it sound like it?
If they’re really in a relationship, they’re being too brazen in front of me.
An Xiaoning negotiated, “Let him return to S Nation while I stay at your place. Will that do?”
“I won’t do anything to you guys. He may come along,” Pei Yi said insistently.
An Xiaoning did not argue any further.
They arrived shortly after they left the Donggong family mansion, because it was not too far away from Mount Qingping.
An Xiaoning was filled with a mix of emotions.
Qin Guo was overwhelmed with displeasure the instant she saw An Xiaoning. After they entered, she immediately rolled her eyes in annoyance.
Why did Ancestor bring this jinxed troublemaker back again?

Chapter 1898: Don’t Even Consider, It’s Unforgettable (Part Four)
Yan Rusheng rolled his eyes. “Wen Xuxu, you think too highly of yourself.”
“Are you implying that I’m not pretty?” 
Wen Xuxu pouted as she frowned at him.
Yan Rusheng was momentarily stumped before breaking into a smile. His hand, which was on her waist, traveled to her chest before he pinched her.
He bent to glare at her with malice in his eyes. “You… sly and stupid woman.”
He hastened his footsteps and walked to the bed. Throwing his gentleness to the wind, he threw Xuxu on the bed. Then he removed his shirt impatiently.
After removing his belt and every other clothing on him, he pounced on Xuxu.
He was rough and acting on his whims.
He gazed into the depths of Xuxu’s eyes and her heartbeat raced rapidly.
After all these years, her heart would still pound and race whenever she looked into his eyes. She would always feel bashful and shy.
Perhaps she was too familiar with him. Hence she found it embarrassing.
It was true that a rabbit shouldn’t eat the grass by its own burrow. And never to target your close ones.
He watched as Xuxu’s face turned red, and he was consumed with excitement and a twinge of annoyance. He was excited because of hormones and his surging desires, and yet he was annoyed by how she acted.
Although he liked how bashful and shy she was, he didn’t like how reserved and aloof she was. She never took the initiative.
“What else do you want to know? I’ll tell you everything. Look at me.” 
Yan Rusheng pressed his hands against the sides of Xuxu’s face as he forced her to look into his eyes.
Xuxu turned crimson once more, and her eyes flickered back and forth. She said, “Then say it. Did you steal any other love letters?”
“Hmmm…” 
Yan Rusheng’s face crumpled with concentration. “Other than Zhao Zheng’s love letter and Jiang Zhuoheng’s chocolate and movie tickets, there was one more. Hao Bang, the son of the public security bureau chief, who was one grade above us. He gave you a rainbow-colored candy.”
Xuxu was startled. “What? Hao Bang?”
The top scorer for Sciences in the college entrance exams?
All the students tend to wordplay on his name and coupled with his reputation, everyone addressed him as Awesome.
When she first heard of this name, she remembered him instantly.
But wasn’t he a nerd? Why would he send her a gift?
“Exactly, I hated his name. And whoever gave him that name.” 
Yan Rusheng hissed menacingly. “Luckily, I ate the candy. It was filled with food coloring that it stained my entire tongue with all the colors. It’s a rubbish food. And miserly!”
Xuxu was speechless.
So, according to him, she should be thankful that he ate the candy on her behalf?
Xuxu bit back a laugh while feeling annoyed too. Her eyes roved over his face and she jabbed him hard in his forehead. “Yan Rusheng, you’re really atrocious!”
He had gotten what he wanted, and yet he was still pretending. This was really his forte.
Amused, she probed, “So because of his son, you disliked bureau chief?”
She may have posed him a question, but she sounded assertive.
Yan Rusheng pressed his lips quietly to admit it.
Xuxu accidentally met his eyes once more and her face turned red. She hurriedly averted her gaze.
She asked, “How did you manage to do all these? Why wasn’t I aware at all?”
She pouted. Her mind raced for other things to say.

Chapter 210: Zhu and the Empress Dowager’s Various Matters (64)
In that moment, Xiao Mo’s heart was completely shredded by sadness.
The Du Zhu… didn’t dare to move.
Once the body moved, the brain would also began to move. He was so clever, how could he not know that Bai Weiwei was dead.
He didn’t want to admit it, couldn’t bear to think too deeply. He could only force himself to sit like this. To convince himself that Bai Weiwei just slumbering, that she would wake up.
Xiao Mo thought that only when Bai Weiwei’s body began to rot, would the Du Zhu would really recover his sanity. Realizing that he was holding hands with a person who had been dead for many hours.
But strangely, Bai Weiwei’s body did not change.
Rather her pale complexion was much better. Aside from the coldness of her body, there was no reason to suspect that she wasn’t just resting.
No trace of the characteristics of a corpse appeared.
As Mu Yanjun stayed beside her, his eyes were getting brighter and brighter.
The divine doctor, that rotten old man was finally escorted in. He ate a heart protecting pill, “I estimate this old life is also mostly gone. “
Mu Yanjun had not slept for five days, who couldn’t see how physically tired he was.
Yet his whole consciousness was unusually awake, terribly sober and abnormal.
“After I let her take the medicine, she just fell asleep. I think I should have you come take a look, when will she wake up?”
The old man sighed as he went to the bedside to take Bai Weiwei’s pulse.
“In fact, this phenomenon is extremely rare, and it does not need a cure, but there is a particularly important thing to do…”
Mu Yanjun listened attentively, like a good student. There was a fire in his eyes.
The old man’s voice became quieter, “That is to heal another person…”
Mu Yanjun leaned forward, unwilling to miss his words.
The result was the rotten old man’s technique struck like lightning, and in an instant a needle was stuck in My Yanjun’s neck.
Mu Yanjun’s eyes suddenly widened, his hand already striking toward the top of the bad old man’s head.
Xiao Mo’s hand shot out and blocked Mu Yanjun’s attack.
After this sequence of events, Mu Yanjun was unable to endure and fell unconscious.
The old man touched his head, “I almost died, but my guess is, I will not live long anyway. It would be good if he woke up without going crazy.”
Bai Weiwei was not going to come back.
And Mu Yanjun’s condition was simply distress entering the heart and spirit, five viscera six bowels all developed problems.
Didn’t eat, didn’t sleep, didn’t think, didn’t move, he lived no different from the dead. If he stayed up for two days more, it can be assumed that he would also go together with Bai Weiwei.
Xiao Mo looked at the old man, “You will preserve the life of my family’s Du Zhu. If you can’t protect him this time, I will kill you by myself.”
Having said that, she turned around and silently went to the place they received punishment.
The old man sighed, “No wonder my master said, you can’t buy sweet potatoes in the capital as a divine doctor. Everyone takes me for a god, but even a god can’t make a person who wants to die to live, ah.”
Mu Yanjun only slept for two hours, then his eyes opened.
He was shocked, his eyes revealed a rare panic when he found himself unable to move.
The rotten old man saw he was awake, “I gave you acupuncture, your heart was in decline, but I gave you treatment. Otherwise, you would go to see King Yama.”
Mu Yanjun eyes were dark. His face was pale, but full of anger, enough to make others shudder.
The old man pierced him with another needle, “I didn’t want to save you, after all, your heart is incomparably poisonous. To save someone like you today, wouldn’t it mean that the world will be messed up.”
Mu Yanjun’s voice was soft and strange, “Let me go.”
The old man shook his head, “This I can not, I couldn’t save the little person in your heart. Saving you is compensation.”
Mu Yanjun suddenly began to smile bitterly, “You can’t pay, how could it be compensated, even if you saved all the world, it couldn’t repay one hair of hers.”

Chapter 369: Finally Safe from Danger
As a curbstomp ensued, both parties opened fire. The smell of gunpowder filled the air above the sea.
The high-velocity magnetic wave gun in Bai Ye’s hands fired again and another plane was destroyed by him. This gun was nothing short of perfect and he was getting hooked. The young kid kept commanding with calm and ease. The First Terrorist Organization’s air force became an impregnable force that attacked and defended whilst they prepared their final round of attack.
Nikolai saw how bad things were and could not be any more concerned about his ego and loudly said, “Master, let’s retreat. If we keep this up, we will be utterly decimated.”
Louis, a sinister look on his face, clenched his fists tightly as rage emanated from him. While he could try to clearly and sensibly assess the situation, reluctance overcame him. 
All his hard work had gone to waste as he was defeated with them within his grasp. Damn it!
A murderous intent flashed past his emerald eyes and then sank into silent melancholy. He turned to Nikolai and nodded as he immediately ordered a retreat.
Louis focused his gaze at the two of them who drifted above the sea and coldly harrumphed. They were lucky this time, and he would not allow it to slide.
“Darling child, they are retreating. Shall we pursue them?” Bai Ye smiled. He took a special liking to this magnetic wave gun and hugged it as though he was hugging his child. He curled his lips into a calm and dangerous smile.
The young kid elegantly smiled and halted the attack. There was a deep calm in his eyes as he slowly said, “If we stop the chase and let him die, it would be such a waste. This game of cat and mouse has just begun.”
The tables have turned.
Louis should really have not and damn not ought to piss him off. He must find somebody to die with Nuo Nuo.
While Louis could dictate how and when the game ought to be played…
The young kid coldly smiled aggressively. He would call the shots on how and when the game shall end.
Bai Ye smiled as he waved his hand handsomely. “Noted, we’ll call off the pursuit. We have the resources to play along with him. For all you know, somebody else will take care of Louis before we take action.”
The young kid coldly smiled as he looked in the direction they escaped.
“Chu Li, the battle has ended, so there’s no need for support. Let’s immediately RTB.” 
Bai Ye ordered his men to return to Rome after ending his call with Chu Li.
Black Eagle and company dragged Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya up with immense effort. As they knew that Cheng Anya had a virus on her, they were already prepared from the start. Third Young Master Ye also warned them that he carried a virus in him, so Black Eagle and company also took precautions.
Third Young Master Ye lied down and panted. He could not help but kick Miss Cheng. “Dear Anya, you are so heavy and have to lose weight.”
His shoulders were a little numb from swimming in the sea for a long time. To consume that much energy from swimming and hang Cheng Anya to swing in this manner took its toll on his elbows.
He almost dropped her into the ocean. He felt chilly as he recalled it.
Black Eagle and company cheered for their safety and those who had to give towels and pour hot water did what they had to do. With everyone extremely busy, some even mused and asked Third Young Master Ye how life in the past few days had been.
On the plane, the men gathered and it was bustling to life with heroism.
Cheng Anya took the towel from Black Eagle to dry her hair and then wrap her shivering body. She ignored what he said. She was finally safe. She sneezed and could not help but wrap herself tighter with her towel.
Black Eagle broke into a smile and said, “Third master, if madam was any skinnier, you would call her ribs.”
“I am about to.” 
Third Young Master Ye also dried himself off the seawater. “This is why ribs are so important.”
Keeping in line with the adage that ‘silence is golden’, Cheng Anya remained silent. Black Eagle got them two sets of clothes for them to change into. As they were men’s clothes, Cheng Anya looked comical in them. She instead used a blanket and wrapped herself in them.
Just as she finished changing her clothes, Black Eagle told her that Ning Ning wanted to speak to her.
Cheng Anya excitedly grabbed over the headset. “Darling, Mommy’s here.”
“Hi, Mommy, do you miss your darling child?” 
The young kid sat on the sofa as he smiled while talking to Cheng Anya. He had not heard from his mommy in a long time. He really missed her voice.
“Not the slightest bit.” 
Cheng Anya coldly harrumphed and sounded fierce. “You are such a noob to take so long to find Mommy. You deserve a spanking.”
As Ning Ning thought about Xu Nuo, he felt tightness in his chest and smiled instead. “Okay, darling me will accept the spanking. Once we are back in Rome, you can spank me however you want. But I really do miss you, Mommy. Mommy, how dare you not dote on me at all? I dislike you.”
“I reject that dislike.” 
Cheng Anya smiled widely and asked worryingly, “Were you injured?”
“Nope, I am perfectly intact, so don’t worry,” Ning Ning smiled and said. “Mommy, the plane is landing. Let’s talk later.”
“Okay.”
The young kid turned off the communicator and Cheng Anya took a mouthful of warm water to warm herself. While Third Young Master Ye looked on and hoped to have a word or two with his son, the call ended before he could even have a chat with his son. He looked at Cheng Anya with accusing eyes amidst his immense unhappiness.
Miss Cheng calmly ignored him while Black Eagle laughed and said, “Third master, the plane is landing soon. You will get to see young master in a moment.”
Third Young Master Ye, feeling he had been totally ignored, could not help but pinch Miss Cheng. He said, “That heartless tyke.”
“You’re so petty!” 
Cheng Anya scolded him in laughter as she passed hot water to him. Third Young Master Ye, holding the cup that Miss Cheng gave him, drank all the remaining hot water. Some alcohol to warm the body up at this moment would be perfect.
The planes were about to soon land in a castle. Chu Li, Ye Wei, Eleven and company were all present. Once they saw that Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya were safe, everybody heaved a sigh of relief.
“Third brother, third sister-in-law, you two look absolutely hideous…” 
Ye Wei laughed extremely carefreely. “Third brother, I should take a photo of this for memento’s sake.”
“You damn lass.” 
Third Young Master Ye scolded her in laughter. With Wei Wei, Eleven, and the young kid all safe, he was relieved.
How could anything else give the immense amount of relief after all that he had put in?
The young kid wanted to hug Cheng Anya, but she ordered him to stop. The young kid then realized that his mommy carried the virus. Black Eagle had mentioned it, and the young kid’s heart slightly sank when he saw his daddy and mommy hold hands.
“Daddy, Mommy, you are all… Bai Ye, please quickly check them up.” 
The young kid’s first reaction was to look for Bai Ye. As he was a genius doctor, there was nothing he could not cure.
“Got it, got it. Don’t worry.” 
Bai Ye smiled.
“Virus?” 
A handsome dude with gold hair and blue eyes blinked. “Dear stupid, isn’t this your strength?”
Stupid?
Bai Ye flexed his wrists and broke into a dashing and gentle smile. “Jason, wanna try calling me stupid again?”
“…F***! What’s wrong with calling you stupid? You are all along stupid, and how dare you call Black J the Iron.” 
Jason, who was known for his fiery tongue was also unbelievably handsome, lashed out at them like a gold-mane lion.
His sky-blue eyes were as bright as sapphire.
When he flew into a rage, he emanated a wave of chilling anger that was akin to a volcano erupting. His domineering streak was clearly visible.
To the side, Black J was a Chinese-English mixed-blood male in his twenties who had extremely delicate features. His features had a mysteriousness Orientals had, and also had the deepness the Westerners had. He had a pair of gray-blue eyes that seemed slightly blurry and gave people the wrong impression of him being deeply passionate. On closer observation, he was extremely keen and had deeply concealed introversion.
The two leaders of the First Terrorist Organization were not old and had interesting personalities. Their aura was so strong, as though they ruled over the world. This was despite the three major leaders of the group being present.
As one looked at them, visual dissonance stood out.
“Jason, you sure need a lesson.” 
Eleven coldly harrumphed. “What’s with calling him stupid? Wallop him.”
Ye Wei looked at them and shook her head. “Third brother, third sister-in-law, ignore them. Get a hot water shower before the checkup lest you fall sick.”
She beckoned the maidservants to bring Ye Chen and Cheng Anya for a shower. While the young kid wanted to follow along, he had to stay here. Just as Bai Ye was about to wallop somebody, the young kid quickly grabbed his collar.
“Bai Ye, do you have a way to save my daddy and mommy?”
The child’s eyes were like two black grapes embedded in his tender face, extremely bright and filled with hope. Once Bai Ye shook his head, the brightness in his gaze dimmed.
Jason, in one fell swoop, swooped the young kid into his embrace and grandly said, “Dear child, relax. Mister Stupid can save even the dead, let alone somebody alive. Why worry then? When you are free, help me level the Mafia’s defenses.”
“Who had just doubted Bai Ye’s medical skills?” 
Black J expressed his doubts. Jason’s slap came over, and he deftly avoided it.
The young kid, who was being hugged by a tall guy, felt extremely conflicted. He kicked Jason and said, “Let me down.”
“Damn it, I want such a son too. Ning Ning, would you want to be my son? Gee, I’ve been craving for you for a tad too long,” Jason said as emotions surged in his eyes. It was as though the young kid was like a piece of meat to be savored.
Everybody was stunned into silence.
Bai Ye smiled and said, “Jason, please have your mommy brush up your mandarin and stop blaming Commander for his poor choice of words. You are… no better off.”
“Commander and I are of different leagues, okay?” 
Jason was extremely unhappy that people consistently associated him with Commander. This was a problem of principle. Good men and bandits were never family.
The young kid struggled and Jason put him down. The young kid asked, “Bai Ye…”
“Ning Ning, I can only be certain after I have checked them. Do not panic for now,” Bai Ye said as he gently rubbed his hand on the young kid’s face. “You’ve my promise that I’ll do all that I can.”
The young kid had just lost Xu Nuo. Now that his parents’ fate was in the balance, he felt uneasy however calm he was. He could not afford to lose his parents, and Bai Ye clearly understood how he felt.
“Don’t worry too much,” Bai Ye said.
Ye Wei said, “That should settle it. Once Bai Ye is on the case, there is no problem in the world he cannot solve. If Louis can develop such a virus, there must be an antidote somewhere. If Bai Ye can’t solve that problem, he ought to be stripped of his title.”
Chu Li smiled and said, “Agreed.”
“Dear stupid, do you have a title?” 
Jason asked with some doubt. He had no idea what title Bai Ye had.
Eleven wanted to wallop him with a punch.
“That said, why didn’t the two of you manage to capture Louis?” 
Black J asked. “The earlier this scoundrel dies, the earlier our minds are at ease.”
“I’ve long wanted to waste that asswipe. Given how the Mafia has been starting conflicts all around recently, this guy has to be sufficiently terrible to wax and wane when his headquarters has been leveled.”
“As for Louis, let’s not hasten,” the young kid slowly said as his face broke into a dangerous smile and a scheming intent showed through his eyes. “To win without fighting is the ideal situation, and our personal vendetta with him another thing. That said, the turf war between the Mafia and terrorists is another thing. 
If we want to eliminate the Mafia, we will have to incur a massive financial cost and material burden. 
Following his recent engagement with us, his position in the Mafia would be precarious. I’ve long suspected that there is a power center in the Mafia that is hidden from plain sight, which explains why Louis’ suicidal maneuver was halted. Since that is the case, let’s allow Louis to take the lead, fish out this power center, and take them out in one fell swoop.”
How scheming indeed…
That was everybody’s sentiments.
Although he was typically scheming and devious, people would excessively dote on him given his extremely young age. That, added to how tender he looked, often caused people to overlook what he was capable of.
“Scheming!” 
Jason said as he gave a thumbs-up. He was the one who was quicker to take action and contemplated much less than the others. He would, more often than not, go with Blackjack and Chu Li’s plans.
He always yielded to the young kid’s plans.
To have formidable brainpower behind a group of action-takers made for an extremely terrifying force.
“I agree with Ning Ning’s thoughts,” Chu Li said. He and Bai Ye agreed with Ning Ning’s thoughts. “Let’s settle everything once and for all lest people forget their place and consistently start a fight. It is not too bad an idea.”
“When did I ever rebut Ning Ning? Gee, we are always in cahoots with each other.” 
Black J laughed. “This time, however, we ought to teach the Mafia a lesson so that they will stay out of our path even after fifty years from now.”
Bai Ye nodded as he had no opinion. He wanted to understand the virus that Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya carried. That was critical. Chu Li could handle everything else.
Ye Wei and Eleven looked each other in the eye. What was this other ‘power center’?
A familiar face appeared in both their minds. Was it Mo Ye and Mo Jue?
In the Mafia, they were the only ones who had sufficient clout and yet mysterious. They could not figure out anyone else save them who had the charisma. Since they were leagues above Louis, there was no reason they would listen to him.
As everyone else moved toward the living room, the young kid went to look for Cheng Anya, who happened to have had her shower and had a cup of hot tea. Her body was warm and her cheeks were slightly rosy. She sat on the bed and slowly pondered about something as she looked at her fingers.
“Mommy…” 
The young kid opened the door and entered, smiling as he walked toward her.
Cheng Anya turned around and winked. She praised him and said, “Darling, you are sure top-class.”
He was, in his dress, really awesome-looking and seemed nowhere near a child. He was simply a dangerous person.
“Thank you for the praises, Mommy.”
“Don’t come close and sit further away. I’m afraid that I could not help it but spank you.” 
Cheng Anya smiled as she pointed toward the sofa. “Sit around there.”
The young kid stared at Cheng Anya angrily. “Mommy, you are despising me.”
“Indeed.” 
Cheng Anya smiled as she looked at the young kid in the eye. She felt that this kid had changed in some way. Although he looked no different from before, mothers, however, understood their child best. Whatever changes the child went, and however well-hidden they were, she could somewhat sense it.
“Mommy, why are you looking at me like this? Don’t you think that I am properly handsome?” 
The young kid playfully blinked his eyes. He looked extremely adorable.
Cheng Anya looked at him with a seeming smile and said, “You have taken quite a leaf from your daddy’s narcissistic streak. That said, have you been okay this while? Be honest to Mommy, okay? Were you bullied?”
The young kid shook his head and said, “No.”
“Nonsense. Louis showed me a photo of you clearly beaten and bloodied.” 
Cheng Anya did not believe and said through gritted teeth, “Even if he is eviscerated thousand times over, it won’t ease the hate in me.”
As she recalled what she had experienced, Cheng Anya deeply hated Louis.
There was a veneer of coldness across her bright face, and she had an even worse premonition when she thought about what the young kid had experienced.
“Mommy, I really am fine. The photo was most likely edited.” 
The young kid elegantly smiled and rolled up his sleeves to show a white and tender arm. “See, no injuries.”
As the bullet wound on his arm had largely recovered and quickly, he was not afraid of Cheng Anya discovering it at all.
And the lashes that he suffered were because of Xu Nuo. Since Xu Nuo was the person who scourged him, he did not feel that he was bullied. Instead, he missed the pain when she walloped him before.
If Nuo Nuo were still alive, he didn’t mind her walloping him all day long.
“Ning Ning, are you really okay?” 
Cheng Anya frowned. She did not miss the hint of pain that flashed through her son’s eyes.
The young kid nodded and said, “I am really fine. Mommy, Daddy and you are in a rut. Uncle Black Eagle mentioned that you have caught a virus. How did Daddy catch it too?”
As Cheng Anya recalled a horny Third Young Master Ye, she could not help but blush and had no desire to mention what happened. “Don’t ask. We had jumped out of a plane once over the desert, and another time over the ocean. How could we not contact each other?”
Miss Cheng replied calmly and the young kid did not doubt her.
“Mommy, do not worry. You two will be saved by Bai Ye’s top-notch medical skills.”

Chapter 437 – Running Into a Steel Wall
The moment Bluesilver Golden Array activated, the flames grew dim. Then the array sucked all of the flames up!
But the flaming gourd wouldn’t be defeated so easily. It turned its mouth up a bit and spewed yet another burst of fire, rocketing itself out of the golden array’s domain.
All of this happened in the blink of an eye!
She’s a tough one! Tang Wulin’s expression hardened.
They needed to defeat her as soon as possible, otherwise the enforcers would arrive to back her up.
The gourd rotated downward and ejected the woman in a fiery blaze. Fury filled her eyes. “What the hell are you kids doing?”
Before she could continue questioning them, golden light flashed beneath her and her body went stiff.
Tang Wulin took advantage of this opening and commanded his bluesilver grass to bind her. Ye Xinglan then rushed in and thrust her sword at the woman’s chest. Xie Xie took action as well, appearing behind the woman and swiping his Light Dragon Dagger at her neck.
Their movements were in perfect sync!
Against a single opponent, there was nothing better than Xu Xiaoyan’s Starwheel Shackles.
Its power was absolute!
Just when they thought they had defeated the woman, the Stargod Sword and Light Dragon Dagger inches from taking her life, the woman’s eyes flashed and a phoenix’s cry pierced the air.
Fiery light glowed beneath her clothing, bursting forth to envelop her entire body in an instant. Rings of light appeared all over her body, and with it, the intensity of her soul power fluctuations surged to an even higher level.
She was several times stronger than before, her soul power manifesting around her as a giant ring of flames. A golden pattern appeared on the gourd above her, and it grew to two feet diameter.
The flames around her forced Ye Xinglan and Xie Xie away from her, then continued to linger on their bodies and feed on their soul power.
The phoenix’s cry continued to grow stronger. The woman stood up straight. She began to exude an air of grandeur as a crimson set of armor manifested to cover her entire body.
A phoenix helmet materialized into being, snug on her head. Crimson body armor traced the elegant silhouette of her womanly figure. Veins of fire spread from her shoulders to her fingertips.
A fiery golden phoenix emblem was engraved onto her breastplate. The armor itself wasn’t particularly beautiful, but it emphasized her womanly charm and elevated it to another level.
Tang Wulin sputtered. Then a bitter smile formed on his lips.
From the complexity of the design and the strength of power fluctuations, Tang Wulin knew she was wearing one-word battle armor. She had used the rings of light from earlier as a method of storage.
Normal one-word armor couldn’t merge with the user after all.
Yet this was a full set of one-word battle armor!
This five-ringed woman now possessed might comparable to that of a seven-ringed soul master!
Yan Feng was furious right now. She had been in a good mood when she set out for the Spirit Pagoda this morning to register as a one-word battle armor master.
She was the youngest one-word battle armor master in Heaven Spirit City, and this gave her the leverage to sign a retainer contract with great benefits. 
The Spirit Pagoda promised to invest in her and bring her up to the two-word level, upon which she could be considered a powerful figure on the continent.
Yet right after she left the Spirit Pagoda buzzing with joy, she was ambushed by a bunch of kids!
These kids weren’t weak either, and they managed to force her to bring out her battle armor.
She couldn’t possibly have known that Tang Wulin’s gang meant no harm, and she had felt genuinely threatened by the Stargod Sword and Light Dragon Dagger.
The moment Yan Feng brought out her battle armor, Wu Zhangkong’s voice rang in the ears of everyone in Tang Wulin’s group. “If you are able to defeat her, you will fulfill the quota for this city.”
Tang Wulin’s mouth twitched. Teacher Wu, oh Teacher Wu! How could you do this to us! 
She’s a one-word battle armor master! She’s as strong as a seven-ringed Soul Sage! How are we supposed to defeat someone like that?
Before Tang Wulin could continue his train of thought, Yan Feng pointed at Tang Wulin and the gourd expelled flames toward him.
I can’t talk her down anymore! Tang Wulin could see the inextinguishable fury in her eyes.
They could only give it their all. We have no other choice!
Tang Wulin sucked in a deep breath even as the flames flew at him. His three purple soul rings disappeared, and in an instant, they were replaced by a single golden one. Golden light erupted from him as scales rippled into existence to cover his right arm, and his hand transformed into a dragon claw. Threads of starlight shot out of his hand and wrapped themselves around it, manifesting as a gauntlet.
He couldn’t afford to hold back against a real battle armor master!
“Battle armor?” 
Yan Feng was startled by the gauntlet on Tang Wulin’s claw. Impossible!
He’s so young! 
There’s no way he could have a piece of battle armor! It came from within his body too! Could it actually be a piece of two-word armor?
Even though it was just a one-word gauntlet, it was unthinkable for such a young kid to have it.
Yan Feng got her first piece of battle armor when was twenty-one years old, and she was considered a genius for it.
She had been hard at work these past few years and finally managed to craft a full set.
Yet Tang Wulin was years ahead of her.
The instant Tang Wulin made his move, so too did his comrades.
Positioned in the backline, Xu Lizhi did the only thing he could do. He threw soup buns and bean buns to the others.
Tang Wulin caught it the buns from behind with his left hand and immediately ate them.
He had to finish this as soon as possible.
Even one-word battle armor possessed the ability to boost its user’s soul power recovery.
A prolonged battle guaranteed defeat for them.
Tang Wulin stomped the ground with his left foot and shot forward, shattering the ground below. His blood essence boiling as the power of the Golden Dragon King surged within him. His eyes became a resplendent gold, and the oppressive aura of his blood essence coalesced.
Brandishing his dragon claw, he swung it in front of him and split the incoming flames apart, opening a path to Yan Feng.
As the captain of his team and an assault-type soul master, it was Tang Wulin’s duty to lead the charge. He couldn’t shrink back in the face of an opponent. He had to create an opening for his comrades.
His blood essence and soul power skyrocketed under the influence of the bloodthirst bean buns. Golden scales covered his entire body now, but shone brightest on his right arm and torso.
He has twin martial souls?
Yan Feng went wide-eyed with shock. But only for a moment.
“Hmph!” 
She glared at Tang Wulin and stood her ground. The gourd above her turned from Tang Wulin to his comrades, spewing flames to isolate him.
She wanted to deal with the enemy leader first.
Yan Feng met Tang Wulin’s golden dragon claw with a fist of her own.
The instant before the two collided, a draconic roar erupted from Tang Wulin’s body. A golden dragon head half a meter in diameter shot out of his fist and toward Yan Feng’s!
It was Golden Dragon Shocks the Heavens!
Tang Wulin may not have broken the fourth seal after eating the ruby shrimp, but they had still boosted his power and refined his control over Golden Dragon Shocks the Heavens!
Alarms went off in Yan Feng’s head. She sensed a powerful force suddenly appear in front of her, then her flames were devoured. The golden claw opened up and clamped down on her fist.
Tang Wulin tightened his grip on Yan Feng’s fist, and her battle armor flared up in defense, all of the fiery veins on her armor blazing to life. The phoenix emblem glowed and a transparent phoenix shot out at him.

Chapter 449: “My Neighbor’s Dog”
Fang Zhao was basically set on the house after scrutinizing it carefully without finding any major issues. All that remained was for Nanfeng to negotiate with the real estate agent and the owner.
Curly Hair was in a very good mood today and enjoyed himself thoroughly when he was let loose. 
After Fang Zhao called him ashore, he continued playing around in the sand. When they were finally leaving, Curly Hair stared longingly out the car window.
Nanfeng chuckled when he saw this. “Don’t worry Curly Hair, you’ll be moving in the next time we come. You’ll be able to play as much as you want and swim in the ocean every day. There are even small fish and aquatic creatures to play with.”
Curly Hair was delighted and laid down to envisage his blessed future life.
What sort of impression did Curly Hair have of the ocean?
An image of a free seafood buffet.
His cheerful mood persisted all the way until they returned back to the advanced students’ dormitory.
After Nanfeng and the other two left, Fang Zhao shut his dorm door. “Come here, Curly Hair.”
Curly Hair wagged his tail and went over.
“Did you enjoy playing today?” 
Fang Zhao asked.
“Woof!”
“Did you have fun there?” 
Fang Zhao asked again.
Curly Hair leaped up and barked again. He wagged his tail vigorously.
“Speak.”
“Fun!” 
Curly Hair replied.
He had already gotten used to switching languages already, and his pronunciation was rather smooth now.
“Mmhm.” 
Fang Zhao nodded, then turned on the learning console.
Curly Hair: “…”
His ears shuddered and he shrank back a step.
Fang Zhao ignored Curly Hair’s retreat. He turned on the learning console and opened a file for Curly Hair. Inside the file were e-books that he had purchased for Curly Hair.
“Ocean Environment Protection Law”
“Environmental Conservation Series For Young Adults”
“Protected Marine Creatures List”
“Marine Environmental Management”
“100 Facts About The Ocean That New Era People Need To Understand”
“The Ocean, My Home”
There was a total of twenty books. All of them were related to the ocean.
On top of that, there were twenty sets of test questions as well.
Curly Hair: “…”
His trembling ears drooped down.
“I know you read fast. You ought to be even faster now, right?” 
“After you finish reading the twenty books in the file and get full marks for all twenty sets of test questions, I will let you out to play in the ocean.” 
“By my estimates, there are probably less than fifteen days before we can move in,” Fang Zhao said.
This was all knowledge that could be memorized. Given Curly Hair’s current memory and learning ability, obtaining full marks wasn’t a difficult task.
Fang Zhao wasn’t worried about Curly Hair’s safety when he went out into the ocean. On the contrary, he was worried that Curly Hair would eat up and eradicate endangered marine creatures.
Even now, Fang Zhao didn’t know exactly how big Curly Hair’s stomach was. 
During the filming on Planet Bu, Curly Hair was secretly eating a lot of other creatures in the desert and the sea. It was only because of Fang Zhao’s warning that Curly Hair didn’t really go all out and eat. 
After all, his time in Planet Bu wasn’t very long, and Fang Zhao had given him restrictions. He also had to be careful of being seen by other people on Planet Bu and hadn’t been able to eat too much in secret.
However, after moving into the new place, Curly Hair would have the opportunity to go to the sea every day. No matter what restrictions were in place, this single dog would be an invasive force that would wreck the marine ecosystem in that area.
Fang Zhao had to get Curly Hair to understand certain things beforehand. It hadn’t been easy for the marine life to recover to the current levels of today. It couldn’t be destroyed by Curly Hair.
Forget about playing in the ocean if you don’t get full marks! There’ll only be the learning console for you!
On a certain day, Nanfeng came to look for Fang Zhao regarding the renovations of the new place.
Upon entering the dormitory, Nanfeng saw Curly Hair facing the wall with a drooped head. There were tear stains beneath his dog eyes.
Nanfeng paused for a moment, then looked away and went to find Fang Zhao. He had to settle the matters at hand first. 
Besides, this was normal behavior from Curly Hair. Nanfeng had already gotten used to it and could remain calm when seeing this.
After discussing the renovation issue, Nanfeng recalled something he had seen today and asked, “Oh, right. Boss, did you see the stuff online today?”
“What stuff?” 
Fang Zhao had been writing a thesis today and had set his personal terminal to “Do not disturb”.
There was a lot of talk online regarding Fang Zhao. Many people were looking for him. Thus, Fang Zhao could only use the “Do not disturb” mode.
“Do you know about Will’s painting?” 
Nanfeng asked.
“Yeah, is it regarding Will’s graduation works?”
Fang Zhao had gone to see Will’s graduation exhibition already. Will too had gotten a high A+ evaluation. Amongst his graduation pieces was a painting of Curly Hair titled “My Neighbor’s Dog”.
The exhibition had already ended two days ago. Furthermore, because Fang Zhao had been working on a thesis in his dormitory since morning, he really wasn’t aware of the online news.
Nanfeng told Fang Zhao what he knew.
It turned out that after Will’s graduation exhibition had concluded, the school had displayed his art pieces on the school’s website. This had garnered a lot of discussion.
Will had successfully both of his goals set last year from his advanced student plan. His short-term objective had been to paint Fang Zhao. His final objective had been to paint Fang Zhao’s dog.
His short-term objective had long been completed. Back then, Will’s painting of “My Neighbor” had generated quite some buzz online. There were even netizens joking that Will had painted Fang Zhao like an alien.
Following “My Neighbor”, “My Neighbor’s Dog” became a trending search on that day.
“My Neighbor’s Dog” was the art piece that Will had spent the most time and effort on during his advanced studies period. At the same time, it was also the piece Will was most satisfied with.
This painting had a similar style to the previous “My Neighbor”, but it was even more difficult to interpret. One could still make out a human form when viewing “My Neighbor”, but “My Neighbor’s Dog” didn’t seem in any way like a dog. If not for the title of this piece, nobody would think that the dog in this painting was a little pet dog.
The vivid colors were both mysterious and imposing, They pushed the boundaries of the ordinary. But, there seemed to be something off. The longer one looked at it, the more apprehensive one would feel.
“Is Fang Zhao’s dog really that terrifying?” 
A HuangArt student thought back to when he had encountered that curly haired dog in the school’s garden. He then went to do a quick online search of Fang Zhao’s dog. Indeed, he hadn’t remembered wrongly.
Over at HuangArt, those who had attended Fang Zhao’s graduation concert and also viewed Will’s painting up close had other thoughts.
“I must say, the feeling I get from this painting is similar to what I felt from Fang Zhao’s song ‘η’.” 
“It seems to surpass ordinary people’s scope of comprehension.”
Even industry outsiders standing before the painting and observing it silently for a few seconds felt eerie sensations. Even though they didn’t understand, they still shivered.
On the Internet, the discussions became even more intense.
“Will has really let loose after entering advanced studies. His thoughts and ideology are free-flying. It’s no longer something we can understand.”
“What sort of grudge does he have to actually paint Fang Zhao’s dog in such a way?!”
“OP definitely hasn’t seen Will’s previous painting ‘My Neighbor’. First go see how Will painted Fang Zhao before you try to understand it.”
“Perhaps Will was bitten by a dog before and has a psychological scar. Otherwise, why would he have painted it in such a terrifying light?!”
“A little cutie has been turned into a monster!”
“This is called art.”
“Indeed, ordinary people like us aren’t able to understand an artist’s world.”
“Objectively speaking, after staring at it for a whole five minutes, I am still unable to decipher what it is that he wants to express. However, I undoubtedly feel that is impressive despite the weird sensation.”
“This probably classifies as a more abstract art which requires more meticulous viewing.”
“This painting wouldn’t sell well, right?”
“It can be purchased to ward off evil spirits too.”
“I think it’s worthwhile as an investment. This artist Will is still young.”
In actuality, Will had already received some inquiries about purchasing the painting after it was displayed on the school’s website.
Finally, it was a collector from Muzhou who bought “My Neighbor’s Dog”. His bid far exceeded HuangArt’s estimated valuation.
Some people reckoned that this Muzhou collector was overly crazy about Curly Hair. After all, many Muzhou people couldn’t stay calm when it came to Curly hair.
There were also some who felt that this was purely hype, whether because of Will or because of Fang Zhao’s dog. The way that Muzhou people viewed dogs could be impossible to understand sometimes.
Thus, Huangzhou TV Station’s painting and calligraphy channel specially dispatched someone to interview the person who had bought this painting.
During the interview, the Muzhou collector said, “Many people that buy Will’s paintings invest in the artist Will and not the painting.” 
“I am different because what I look at is both the painting and the dog in the painting.” 
“I have a hunch that this painting’s value will skyrocket in the future.”
Little Bear was watching the interview broadcast. “Muzhou people really have a fearsome intuition towards dogs.” 
“Humans are indeed peculiar creatures.”
Thus, because of Will’s painting “My Neighbor’s Dog”, Curly Hair too became a hotly searched topic and appeared on Huangzhou’s trending headlines.
After Nanfeng left, Fang Zhao browsed through the news online and said to Curly Hair, “You can forget about going out these few days. Stand for another five minutes before going back to hit the books.” 
“You only scored 62 for the morning’s test. Go read through the section of protected animals twice more!” 
“Can whales be eaten?!” 
“You can’t eat corals either!”

Chapter 455: About-Turn: Part 3
“Just to show you around to get a hang of the energy perturbation. It’s very simple,” a sorcerer could not help but chime in, smiling.
“Thank you.” 
Lin Sheng nodded at him.
He needed to find the other fragments quickly. He had thought of conquering more dark spirits to get more pure soul power. 
But since he got this opportunity, he was more than happy to take my offer.
The head of the sorcerers brought Lin Sheng at one Darkspirit Gate. 
They both reached out their hands, touching the frame of the gate with eyes closed. 
With his special ability, the head of the sorcerer started to build a dimensional base for coordinate confirmation. 
Following that, the ritual perturbation of the Darkspirit Gate was transmitted together with Lin Sheng’s conscious perception.
“An ordinary teleportation ritual is point-to-point transmission. ”
“But when we explore other dimensional realms, we change it to become one-to-multiple-point transmission. ” 
“What we need to do is to make some minor changes to the parameters on the transmission base.” 
The head of the sorcerers was guiding Lin Sheng’s consciousness as he taught him the technique. 
“This way, the Darkspirit Gate will spontaneously transmit our consciousness into multiple target-dimensions. ”
“It is the luck of the draw. If we get lucky, we might bump into the dimensional realm we are looking for. If we get no luck, just try a few more times.”
“That’s random enough, though.” 
Lin Sheng was dumbfounded.
The ritual instantly perturbed his perception the minute he stepped into the Darkspirit Gate, wrapping it inside as it spread out.
At the same time, his consciousness seemed to break apart, his perception split into a dozen tiny pieces, feeling the energy in a dozen different dimensions.
“Generally, we can’t keep our consciousness in one piece during the transmission. We can only try to remember as best as we can the dimensional coordinates we came across.” 
“We need to leave a simple mark on the coordinates…”
Outside, the sorcerer chief kept doing the explaining, guiding Lin Sheng how to create the simple marking in determining the coordinate code. 
But one thing he had not expected; Lin Sheng’s consciousness was so strong that he could memorize all the coordinates of the dimensions that his consciousness pieces came into. 
To Lin Sheng, it was just a matter of multitasking, a skill that he had been training for every day.
He could use his split consciousness to direct and observe his every summoned creature, although he could not independently control them at the same time. 
Memorizing the perturbation and determining the coordinates were just a walk in the park. 
His strong soul played a part and he could stay for a longer time.
Ten minutes later, the split consciousness dissipated. 
Lin Sheng opened his eyes, looking at the sorcerer chief and others. 
Their eyes were on stalks as he told them a specific coordinate of a special dimensional realm. 
This realm was the one homologous to the Dark Wheel fragment he carried.
“You got it the first time?” 
The sorcerer chief could not believe that he heard. He had spent over two months to find and record the coordinate when he sensed the dimensional energy for the first time.
“It’s a simple process.” 
“Let’s build the portal.” 
“I need to go there quickly,” Lin Sheng instructed.
“Aye.”
“Wait for me.” 
Tenko Kasumi spoke to him through telepathy. He froze.
“What’s up?” 
He went to one side, watching as the sorcerer chief started to direct the dark spirits moving the materials.
“There is a situation here in Visaca Island!” 
Tenko Kasumi’s voice sounded grave.
It was a phenomenon that Lin Sheng had never seen before. 
Tenko Kasumi had never been this depressed, even when Lin Sheng told her about the existence of the Night Lord last time. 
This made Lin Sheng a little nervous.
“Is Mi Yue at an absolute disadvantage?” 
Lin Sheng frowned. 
“Or are there some new forces joining the battle?”
“No. Not new forces,” Tenko Kasumi said. 
“It’s Mi Yue; he had deceived everyone!”
“What?”
“The Sevenlocks Tower has been successful with the summoning. Mi Yue has deceived everyone in the three mysterious realms. He has successfully summoned Faldt, using himself as a sacrifice to make himself as one with it!”
It took a while before that sank in.
“Using himself as a sacrifice?” 
“That madman!”
“So what the three mysterious realms face now is a hybrid monster of Mi Yue and Faldt.”
Lin Sheng was speechless.
“What should we do now?” 
Tenko Kasumi asked.
The combination of Faldt and Mi Yue was not as simple as 1+1=2; it was 3×10.
“Calm down.” 
“The three mysterious realms and other forces are still Mi Yue and Faldt’s biggest enemies.” 
“There is more to this world than meets the eye.” 
The thought of his previous investigation came to mind. 
“The Astral Mere and those having the Sacred Vessel of Destiny are no slouch. ”
“We will not interfere with what they do so long as they don’t interfere with ours.”
“I got what you meant.” 
“But we had better be prepared,” Tenko Kasumi said. 
“I used to possess that destructive power when I was controlled by the Demonblade.” 
“That’s why I know what that kind of power could do.”
Lin Sheng was keeping silent. 
Tenko Kasumi was his most special commander because some power was used to control her. 
At that time, when she traced back her memories, she discovered that Lin Sheng had been peeping at her. 
Just through an image imprint in the memories, she knew that Lin Sheng was observing her. 
Such a powerful ability was beyond the apprehension of Lin Sheng.
“I got it,” Lin Sheng said. 
“I will be prepared.” 
“Don’t worry.” 
If worse comes to worst, he could activate his special state of being by summoning all the commanders to become one with him.
He cut off the telepathic communication with Tenko Kasumi, quietly staring at the newly constructed Darkspirit Gate as his thoughts came back to the matter at hand.
“It is ready, My Lord,” the sorcerer chief said.
Lin Sheng gazed at the portal and remained silent for a while.
“Ask for the Fairy King and Djall!”
Djall Demonhand had been put on standby in the vicinity. 
Hearing the summon, he strode in through the doorway.
“At your service, My Lord.”
Lin Sheng nodded at him.
“I need to open multiple portals to scout out multiple dark-spirit dimensions. ”
“Select one hundred great dark spirits, divide them into groups to do the recce.”
“Understood!” 
Djall Demonhand looked stern, knowing that they had come to some turning point. 
Otherwise, he would not have called for such a large-scale operation.

Chapter 70: East Arrival Cave Master (8)
This was what Song Fu and his group wanted to ask, but having someone else ask it first, they instead looked at each other, and were clearly unaware of what was going on, so how could they answer?
Miao Yi immediately dashed towards the place where the loud noise originated from, and Yan Xiu and his group instantly followed suit.
Song Fu’s group looked at each other, also following behind to see what had happened.
Everyone had reached the mountain gates, and under the moonlight, they could see that the large stone memorial arch that had the words ‘East Arrival Cave’ carved onto it was left shattered to just pieces on the ground. Everyone was shocked to find out that someone had actually destroyed the mountain gates of East Arrival Cave.
Miao Yi suddenly turned his head, and giving Song Fu and his group a vicious look, he said coldly, “Good!”
“I’ve just arrived today, and it seems like someone was anxious to knock me down a peg!” 
“Very good!”
Song Fu and his group were taken aback—they understood what the other party meant, but this incident was not their doing. They’d just been sitting together and holding their own gathering, discussing precisely on how to teach Miao Yi a lesson from now on, and had only run out after hearing the strange noise.
At first, they suspected whether Miao Yi and his group were the ones that did it, but after looking at Miao Yi’s reaction, they felt he had no need to destroy his own mountain gates to teach himself a lesson. After all, Miao Yi was the East Arrival Cave Master, and having your sign destroyed right after your promotion was a very humiliating affair.
They had to make things clear, otherwise if they were blamed, they wouldn’t be able to shoulder the responsibility. Song Fu cupped his fists and declared, “Cave Master, this incident was definitely not our doing!”
The others also followed suit in cupping their fists and assuring Miao Yi, as though it was the first time they’d honestly treated Miao Yi as Cave Master.
“Lies!” 
Miao Yi glared at Song Fu and shouted, “I’ve only just assigned you to watch the mountain gates today, how could you not be aware if someone had destroyed it?” 
“It can only mean you let them do it on purpose!”
“This… ” 
Song Fu stuttered, he hadn’t even been there, and now was not a good time to say that he’d been absent from duty because he didn’t even regard Miao Yi as Cave Master, so he could only cup his fists and respond with ‘honesty’. “Cave Master has just arrived and so is probably unaware, but East Arrival City has yet to send its servants here, so our meals have to be taken care of by ourselves. To sate my hunger, your subordinate had to leave temporarily, but I couldn’t have imagined that something like this would happen.”
Wang Zifa and the rest also cupped their fists and reassured Miao Yi, “Cave Master, we can assure you, Senior Brother Song Fu was having a meal with us just now.”
Miao Yi pointed to the fallen sign and said angrily, “Then are you telling me this fell by itself? Don’t tell me it was blown down by the wind!”
Song Fu was lost for words, and could only raise his hand and say, “Cave Master, I can swear in the name of all the masters from past generations of the School of Blue Jade, this was definitely not our doing. If I’ve uttered a single lie, then let me, Song Fu, die a miserable death!”
Miao Yi’s eyes flashed as he swept his gaze at everyone around him, and said solemnly, “Could it be that someone is seeking trouble at my East Arrival Cave?”
Everyone was shocked—this truly was a possibility, and they began to survey their surroundings.
“What are you all still waiting here for?”
“Don’t tell me you’re waiting for someone to off you in your sleep? Spread out and search for clues, hurry up!” 
Miao Yi voiced angrily.
Yan Xiu and his group were the first to cup their fists and acknowledge the order, and quickly spread out towards the surrounding mountain forests.
“Hmm?” 
Miao Yi snorted loudly, and glared at Song Fu and his group, as though asking—since this was not your doing, why are you still not searching? Do you know something?
Right now they had to prove they’d had nothing to do with the incident. Song Fu quickly turned his head around and remarked, “Hurry up and follow the Cave Master’s orders to search!”
They all cupped their fists at Miao Yi, and quickly dispersed.
But Song Fu was stopped by Miao Yi. “Song Fu, you follow me!”
Song Fu was taken aback, he cupped his fists in acknowledgement, then followed behind Miao Yi.
Just when all of them had left, a hazy silhouette, like a watery reflection, appeared out of thin air. It was none other than the figure of the ever-graceful Lao Bai.
He was looking at the fallen stone memorial arch, and lightly shaking his head, he smiled. “The affairs of the world are like a game of chess; a hot-blooded young man should not only have the bravery of a normal man!”
“Brat, I’ve always been worried that you were too kind-hearted, and easily taken advantage of… A boy must rampage with wit, a reckless brute will not reach the heavens. I am now quite reassured.”
As he said this, his figure’s shape oscillated like waves, and he quietly disappeared amidst the oscillations, with not a trace to be seen.
The candles in the East Arrival Grand Hall danced about as Song Fu followed behind Miao Yi and stood still within. Outside, Charcoal had already stood up, and as though sensing something was about to happen, it sneezed loudly.
Miao Yi expressionlessly glanced at his own prized seat, his hands behind his back as he faced Song Fu. He stood there without uttering a sound.
The atmosphere between the two was slightly tense, and Song Fu waited for a moment, before finally asking, “What does Cave Master ask of me?”
Miao Yi asked in a solemn tone, “Song Fu, are you aware of your sins?”
Song Fu had a trace of mockery on the corner his lips. Looking at the dishes on the short table to the side, he said indifferently, “This incident was not my doing, what sin do I bear?”
“I am not asking about this!” 
Miao Yi suddenly turned around and glared at him. Word by word, he asked coldly, “I ordered you to guard the mountain gates, so why did you leave your post? Do you not regard my Cave Master’s orders with any importance?!”
Song Fu was thinking—what do you think? 
I never held it in any regard in the first place.
Obviously, he would not say that out loud. “Song Fu has already clarified to the Cave Master. I could not help it, and only momentarily left my post to sate my hunger. I do not want to see something like this to happen as well.”
Miao Yi asked, “Do you think if I were to report this to the superiors, Manor Head and Mountain Chieftain, that they would believe your explanation?”
Song Fu chuckled. “A human’s mouth has two layers, so if Cave Master insists on framing me, then please do as you wish. But Cave Master, please do not forget, I also have a mouth to dispute you, and I am not mute.”
Miao Yi laughed. “It seems as though you really will not learn!”
As he said this, Yan Xiu, Dan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun, one after the other, quickly appeared outside the door. They came inside and cupped their fists towards Miao Yi. “Cave Master, for the moment we have not found any suspicious persons.”
Miao Yi replied, “The suspicious person is right in front of you, why do you say you have not found him!”
Dan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun, as though receiving a signal, quickly moved to close the doors to the hall.
Song Fu was shocked upon hearing this, and he quickly turned around, only to find Yan Xiu already angrily swinging forth his broad axes like a reaper.
Song Fu quickly pulled out the sword he always carried, a cold gleam dashed out from the scabbard, a cling-clang as he hastily blocked.
Dan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun also immediately thrust their spears out, attacking Song Fu in unison.
Yan Xiu and Song Fu’s cultivation base was pretty much equal, so the two of them were matched in the first place, but with the addition of Dan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun into the fray, Song Fu’s circumstances immediately became precarious.
“Shameless thief!”
“To dare frame—”
Being surrounded and unable to escape, Song Fu, who could only wave his sword to desperately come to a draw with Yan Xiu, had not even finished bellowing, before two frantically thrusting spears pierced through his transcendence protection, brutally stabbing his chest.
Song Fu’s eyes widened as he desperately turned his head to look at Miao Yi, his lips trembling—the hatred in his eyes was indescribable.
He finally understood that this was a plot, the mountain memorial archway falling was not just to pin the blame on him, but also to separate him from his comrades and to prevent him from retaliating together with them—the main objective was to take his life.

Chapter 805: Last Story
“It’s in the eastern campus?” 
Zhou Tu was obviously hesitant. He had received warnings from both the school and the seniors to stay away from the eastern campus, but they did not give a specific reason. However, from their tone, he could tell that the eastern campus was a very dangerous place.
“You guys have a deep misunderstanding about the eastern campus. It is actually not that different from here, but there are two different administrative styles to the management. The people there live in actual terror, but you guys live in a fake happiness.” 
Chen Ge looked into Zhou Tu’s eyes. “Compared to you lot, they are actually closer to hope because at least they know who they are and know how to achieve salvation.”
Chen Ge did not lie to Zhou Tu; be it the students from eastern or western campus, they were both trapped in the school. 
The students of the western campus had their memories altered and kept repeated the life created by the culprit; the students of the eastern campus at least knew how to look for a scapegoat to try and find a way to escape.
“The students from the eastern campus are closer to hope?”
“But I heard only trash that are not wanted by the western campus are sent to the eastern campus.” 
Zhou Tu was slowly persuaded, but he still felt quite unsettled by the whole idea.
“No matter the standard use, any school that treats their students as trash has to be a trashy school itself, wouldn’t you agree?” 
Chen Ge reached out to point at the tall wall separating the two campuses. “Do you know the purpose of this wall?”
“What is it?”
“It’s because the school is afraid of the worlds going out of control. They utilized various methods to reconstruct societal order, but humanity is the most complicated thing in the world.”
“No matter how they try to alter the memory, once something happens, the scar that has been left behind will forever be seared on the heart.” 
“Not remembering anything doesn’t mean that it has not happened, so the school’s plan is destined to fail from the beginning.” 
Chen Ge kept saying things that the members failed to understand. They had no idea why Chen Ge would say these things, but they found themselves agreeing with him.
Those young men were naturally curious. Chen Ge kept telling them the truth about this school, and he finally managed to arouse their interest.
“So, are we going over there now?” 
“Honestly, I still have a hard time believing that the art room in my dream really exists within the eastern campus,” Zhou Tu whispered cynically.
“Now is not the time.” 
Chen Ge turned to glance at this shadow. The shadow from Room 413 was still alive, but its body had changed. 
If one looked closer, one would realize how Chen Ge’s shadow was different from others. It was dark as ink like it was capable of swallowing the light. 
It seemed to have grown stronger. 
The potential of the shadow was a trump card for Chen Ge. After it had woken up, he would lead the students to the eastern campus and go after abandoned Specters. 
That way, he could not only improve his own power, he could muddy the waters at the school to provide some distraction for the other ‘killer’.
Now is the time to gather strength. Before the culprit notices a small bug like myself, I need to gather as much strength as I can.
Chen Ge turned to look at Wang Yicheng. He knew a thing or two about the other members’ stories, but he knew the least about this limping boy who had been the first member to join his club. “The next location we’re going is Wang Yicheng’s dormitory bedroom.”
“My bedroom?” 
After hearing that, Wang Yicheng gave a strange reaction. He quickly shook his hands. “I don’t think that’s a good idea. There’s nothing worth seeing in my bedroom.”
“When you said that, your tone was higher than normal, and you also spoke faster. Other than that, your eyes were fluttering. You are really bad at lying.” 
Chen Ge touched Wang Yicheng’s shoulder lightly. “Why won’t you let us go there?” 
“What are you worried about us seeing?”
“I…” 
Wang Yicheng thought about it for a long time but could not come up with an excuse. Finally, he turned his head away. “It’s nothing. In that case, let’s go now.”
“Sure.”
Wang Yicheng lived in Room 413 of the western campus while Lin Sisi stayed at Room 413 of the eastern campus. 
The numbering of the room was similar, but in Room 413 of the western campus, other than the fourth bed, the other beds were occupied. Conversely, on the eastern campus, it was the total opposite; only the fourth bed was occupied, and the others were empty.
“We should keep our club’s secret from other people. Try to keep a low profile. There are staff like myself at the school, but there are also other staff who might not share my views.” 
Chen Ge was on high alert. They had created too big a commotion at the lab building, so the school might have started an investigation already.
There’s not much time left for me. After checking Room 413, we should find a place to hide for a while.
There were four floors in total in the western campus’ male dormitory. The number of students was several times higher than the number on the eastern campus. It was not yet time for lights out, and the time they arrived was the most chaotic, lively time at the dormitory. The sound of washing, plastic basins falling, and chatting could be heard when they stood outside the building.
“This building looks similar to the one on the eastern campus.” 
Chen Ge acted very normal as he entered the first building with the four students. 
The door to the manager’s room was closed, but the window was open. A middle-aged woman in her fifties was humming a ditty inside; she seemed to be in a good mood. 
There was a notice stuck next to the window. It spoke of various warnings like the using of high voltage electrical appliances and using a stove fire in the dormitory.
If I remember correctly, the notice on the board in the eastern campus’ dormitory read, ‘Due to the recent vicious crimes happening around campus, students are forbidden from leaving the dormitory after lights out.’
A wall separated two different walls, just like how it was inside and outside the door. 
Walking down the corridor, the group finally reached the door to Room 413.
“This dormitory is no different from other dormitories. I don’t understand why we’re here.” 
Wang Yicheng opened the door. Even when he walked into the room, his roommates treated him like an invisible person. They kept doing their thing, and no one even acknowledged his presence.
After Wang Yicheng took several steps into the room, the boy who had the bed closest to the door suddenly pulled off the cover to glare at him. “How many times I’ve told you this?” 
“Close the door after you enter. I know you’ve injured your leg, but have you injured your ears as well?”
The boy used a very harsh tone; it sounded like he hated Wang Yicheng for some reason.
“The reason he didn’t close the door is because someone else is coming in. If you want an apology, we can apologize on his behalf, but I wonder, what kind of apology do you require?” 
Chen Ge grabbed the doorknob and entered the room. He looked at the occupants. 
When the lad saw Chen Ge, his courage dissipated. With a growl, he pulled the cover back.
“Mr. Bai, this is bed number four. Because it is unoccupied, we use it to store our luggage.” 
Wang Yicheng pointed at the fourth bed. Several suitcases and bags of trash were left on it. In this bedroom, only Wang Yicheng’s stuff was left beside his bed, the other people threw their stuff onto bed four.
Chen Ge was very familiar with bed four because he had slept on it on the eastern campus.
Walking up to the bed, he noticed that even though no one used this bed, there were bed sheets and covers. They had been made dirty by the luggage and trash that was left there.

Chapter 834 “Return to the Holy Land (2)”
“Suzaku.” 
While inside the dainty looking bamboo cabin, Bai Yan was just in the middle of watching her son and Dragony playing out in the front yard when she overheard the commotion: “What’s happening outside, why is there so much noise?” 
“Go have a look.”
Arching her first, the phoenix woman left as told to investigate only to return not long afterwards. Hesitant in her voice: “Queen, there are two people outside wanting to meet you….”
“Looking for me?” 
raising a brow, Bai Yan was rather surprised by the answer. “I’ll go out and meet them then.” 
Getting up from the chair, Bai Yan casually strolled out of the cabin to find two unexpected people quivering at her entrance.
Perhaps it’s the fact that they had climbed up the mountain in such an indignant manner, but those kneecaps had already been ridden with blood, thus leaving a trail behind themselves as well.
“What are you two doing?” 
Slightly furrowing her brow, Bai Yan snaps at the two men.
Pale in the face, Second Elder uncomfortably answers first: “Queen, I am here to atone for my sin. That day I foolishly believed in that imposter’s word and caused the misunderstanding between you and His Majesty, everything is my fault. I am willing to bear any form of punishment you see fit, please punish me.”
“No Queen, the fault is mine and not Second elder’s. His Majesty ordered me to bring you word of his departure in order to lift the seal, but I got careless and mishandled the mission. This is all my fault, please punish me instead.”
Kneeling there with tears slobbering up his face, Fire Plume held nothing back and pulled one of the bamboo sticks out from his back. 
Presenting it before his queen, it’s obvious he wants her to whip him with the damn thing. 
But words are words. When the item finally left his hand after Bai Yan picked it up, his body inherently froze over for the impending strike.
Yet…. 
nothing came of it. 
There’s no pain or the sound of bamboo hitting his flesh, nor are there any words of scolding or curses, just an uncomfortable silence as he hung his head low.
“Did you suffer a lot when crawling up here?” It was Bai Yan who eventually broke the awkward moment with her words.
“Qu… Queen?” 
Fire Plume looks up in confusion, unsure what to make of that.
“In that case then your crimes have been atoned.”
Bai Yan has always been a person who holds a clear line on what’s right and wrong, meaning she would only target those whom wishes her harm. 
What’s more, does she even have the right to get angry at these two when she herself was fooled into those lies? Of course not!
Fire Plume on the other hand was stiff as a rock right now despite the goodwill. This loyal subordinate of Di Cang’s just couldn’t believe he’s going to be let off the hook this easily. 
In fact, this bird man has prepared for the worse. 
The bare minimum would be a long session of being whipped until their skin was bleeding, or at least lose half their life in the process.
Getting annoyed in the face after getting no reaction from the two: “What?” 
“Do you want me to help lift you two up or something?”
Sure enough, the fierce voice finally knocked them both out of the dazed state. Jerking up in his haste, Fire Plume suddenly found himself unable to steady his legs due to the scrapes he suffered so far. 
Even so, he continues to force that shaky leg to remain standing in light of how awkward and funny he appears. If one had to describe his appearance, it would be like a duck squatting around after being tired out.
Unable to bear this ridiculous picture, Bai Yan rolls her eyes and points to the stone stools nearby: “Sit over there and rest. Once the both of you are better then go back.”
