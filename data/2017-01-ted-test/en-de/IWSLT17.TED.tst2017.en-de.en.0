So this is James Risen.
You may know him as the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter  for The New York Times.
Long before anybody knew Edward Snowden's name,  Risen wrote a book in which he famously exposed  that the NSA was illegally wiretapping the phone calls of Americans.
But it's another chapter in that book  that may have an even more lasting impact.
In it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation  in which the CIA quite literally handed over blueprints  of a nuclear bomb to Iran.
If that sounds crazy, go read it.
It's an incredible story.
But you know who didn't like that chapter?
The US government.
For nearly a decade afterwards,  Risen was the subject of a US government investigation  in which prosecutors demanded that he testify  against one of his alleged sources.
And along the way, he became the face for the US government's recent pattern  of prosecuting whistleblowers and spying on journalists.
You see, under the First Amendment,  the press has the right to publish secret information in the public interest.
But it's impossible to exercise that right if the media can't also gather that news  and protect the identities of the brave men and women  who get it to them.
So when the government came knocking,  Risen did what many brave reporters have done before him:  he refused  and said he'd rather go to jail.
So from 2007 to 2015,  Risen lived under the specter of going to federal prison.
That is, until just days before the trial, when a curious thing happened.
Suddenly, after years of claiming it was vital to their case,  the government dropped their demands to Risen altogether.
It turns out, in the age of electronic surveillance,  there are very few places reporters and sources can hide.
And instead of trying and failing to have Risen testify,  they could have his digital trail testify against him instead.
So completely in secret and without his consent,  prosecutors got Risen's phone records.
They got his email records, his financial and banking information,  his credit reports,  even travel records with a list of flights he had taken.
And it was among this information that they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling,  Risen's alleged source and CIA whistleblower.
Sadly, this is only one case of many.
President Obama ran on a promise to protect whistleblowers,  and instead, his Justice Department has prosecuted more  than all other administrations combined.
Now, you can see how this could be a problem,  especially because the government considers so much of what it does secret.
Since 9/11, virtually every important story about national security  has been the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist.
So we risk seeing the press unable to do their job  that the First Amendment is supposed to protect  because of the government's expanded ability to spy on everyone.
But just as technology has allowed the government  to circumvent reporters' rights,  the press can also use technology  to protect their sources even better than before.
And they can start from the moment they begin speaking with them,  rather than on the witness stand after the fact.
Communications software now exists  that wasn't available when Risen was writing his book,  and is much more surveillance-resistant than regular emails or phone calls.
For example, one such tool is SecureDrop,  an open-source whistleblower submission system  that was originally created by the late Internet luminary Aaron Swartz,  and is now developed at the non-profit where I work,  Freedom of the Press Foundation.
Instead of sending an email,  you go to a news organization's website,  like this one here on The Washington Post.
From there, you can upload a document or send information  much like you would on any other contact form.
It'll then be encrypted and stored on a server  that only the news organization has access to.
So the government can no longer secretly demand the information,  and much of the information they would demand  wouldn't be available in the first place.
SecureDrop, though, is really only a small part of the puzzle  for protecting press freedom in the 21st century.
Unfortunately, governments all over the world  are constantly developing new spying techniques  that put us all at risk.
And it's up to us going forward to make sure  that it's not just the tech-savvy whistleblowers,  like Edward Snowden, who have an avenue for exposing wrongdoing.
It's just as vital that we protect the next veteran's health care whistleblower  alerting us to overcrowded hospitals,  or the next environmental worker  sounding the alarm about Flint's dirty water,  or a Wall Street insider  warning us of the next financial crisis.
After all, these tools weren't just built to help the brave men and women  who expose crimes,  but are meant to protect all of our rights under the Constitution.
Thank you.
