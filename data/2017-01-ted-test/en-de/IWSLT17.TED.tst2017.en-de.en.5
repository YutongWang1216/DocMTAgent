1.3 billion years ago,  in a distant, distant galaxy,  two black holes locked into a spiral,  converting three Suns' worth of stuff  into pure energy in a tenth of a second.
For that brief moment in time,  the glow was brighter than all the stars  in all the galaxies  in all of the known Universe.
It was a very  big  bang.
But they didn't release their energy in light.
I mean, you know, they're black holes.
All that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself,  making the Universe explode in gravitational waves.
Let me give you a sense of the timescale at work here.
1.3 billion years ago,  Earth had just managed to evolve multicellular life.
Since then, Earth has made and evolved  corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and even -- God save us -- the Internet.
And about 25 years ago,  a particularly audacious set of people --  Rai Weiss at MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever at Caltech --  to build a giant laser detector  with which to search for the gravitational waves  from things like colliding black holes.
Now, most people thought they were nuts.
But enough people realized that they were brilliant nuts  that the US National Science Foundation decided to fund their crazy idea.
So after decades of development,  construction and imagination  and a breathtaking amount of hard work,  they built their detector, called LIGO:  The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.
For the last several years,  LIGO's been undergoing a huge expansion in its accuracy,  a tremendous improvement in its detection ability.
It's now called Advanced LIGO as a result.
In early September of 2015,  LIGO turned on for a final test run  while they sorted out a few lingering details.
And on September 14 of 2015,  just days after the detector had gone live,  the gravitational waves from those colliding black holes  passed through the Earth.
And they passed through you and me.
And they passed through the detector.
Scott Hughes: There's two moments in my life  more emotionally intense than that.
One is the birth of my daughter.
The other is when I had to say goodbye to my father when he was terminally ill.
You know, it was the payoff of my career, basically.
Everything I'd been working on -- it's no longer science fiction!   Allan Adams: So that's my very good friend and collaborator, Scott Hughes,  a theoretical physicist at MIT,  who has been studying gravitational waves from black holes  and the signals that they could impart on observatories like LIGO,  So let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gravitational wave.
A gravitational wave is a ripple  in the shape of space and time.
As the wave passes by,  it stretches space and everything in it  in one direction,  and compresses it in the other.
This has led to countless instructors of general relativity  doing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity.
"It stretches and expands, it stretches and expands."
So the trouble with gravitational waves  is that they're very weak; they're preposterously weak.
For example, the waves that hit us on September 14 --  and yes, every single one of you stretched and compressed  under the action of that wave --  when the waves hit, they stretched the average person  by one part in 10 to the 21.
That's a decimal place, 20 zeroes,  That's why everyone thought the LIGO people were nuts.
Even with a laser detector five kilometers long -- and that's already crazy --  they would have to measure the length of those detectors  to less than one thousandth of the radius of the nucleus  of an atom.
And that's preposterous.
So towards the end of his classic text on gravity,  described the hunt for gravitational waves as follows:  He said, "The technical difficulties to be surmounted  in constructing such detectors are enormous.
But physicists are ingenious,  and with the support of a broad lay public,  all obstacles will surely be overcome."
Thorne published that in 1973,  42 years before he succeeded.
Now, coming back to LIGO,  Scott likes to say that LIGO acts like an ear more than it does like an eye.
I want to explain what that means.
Visible light has a wavelength, a size,  that's much smaller than the things around you,  the features on people's faces,  the size of your cell phone.
And that's really useful,  because it lets you make an image or a map of the things around you,  by looking at the light coming from different spots  in the scene about you.
Sound is different.
Audible sound has a wavelength that can be up to 50 feet long.
And that makes it really difficult --  in fact, in practical purposes, impossible -- to make an image  of something you really care about.
Your child's face.
Instead, we use sound to listen for features like pitch  and tone and rhythm and volume  to infer a story behind the sounds.
That's Alice talking.
That's Bob interrupting.
Silly Bob.
So, the same is true of gravitational waves.
We can't use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe.
But by listening to changes  in the amplitude and frequency of those waves,  we can hear the story that those waves are telling.
And at least for LIGO,  the frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band.
So if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air, into sound,  we can literally hear the Universe speaking to us.
For example, listening to gravity, just in this way,  can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes,  something my colleague Scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about.
SH: If the two black holes are non-spinning, you get a very simple chirp: whoop!
If the two bodies are spinning very rapidly, I have that same chirp,  but with a modulation on top of it,  so it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir!
It's sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform.
AA: So on September 14, 2015,  a date that's definitely going to live in my memory,  LIGO heard this:  [Whirring sound]  So if you know how to listen, that is the sound of --   SH: ... two black holes, each of about 30 solar masses,  that were whirling around at a rate  comparable to what goes on in your blender.
AA: It's worth pausing here to think about what that means.
Two black holes, the densest thing in the Universe,  one with a mass of 29 Suns  and one with a mass of 36 Suns,  whirling around each other 100 times per second  before they collide.
Just imagine the power of that.
It's fantastic.
And we know it because we heard it.
That's the lasting importance of LIGO.
It's an entirely new way to observe the Universe  that we've never had before.
It's a way that lets us hear the Universe  and hear the invisible.
And there's a lot out there that we can't see --  in practice or even in principle.
So supernova, for example:  I would love to know why very massive stars explode in supernovae.
They're very useful;  we've learned a lot about the Universe from them.
The problem is, all the interesting physics happens in the core,  and the core is hidden behind thousands of kilometers  of iron and carbon and silicon.
We'll never see through it, it's opaque to light.
Gravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass --  The Big Bang: I would love to be able to explore  the first few moments of the Universe,  but we'll never see them,  because the Big Bang itself is obscured by its own afterglow.
With gravitational waves,  we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning.
Perhaps most importantly,  I'm positive that there are things out there  that we've never seen  that we may never be able to see  and that we haven't even imagined --  things that we'll only discover by listening.
And in fact, even in that very first event,  LIGO found things that we didn't expect.
Here's my colleague and one of the key members of the LIGO collaboration,  Matt Evans, my colleague at MIT, addressing exactly that:   Matt Evans: The kinds of stars which produce the black holes  that we observed here  are the dinosaurs of the Universe.
They're these massive things that are old, from prehistoric times,  and the black holes are kind of like the dinosaur bones  with which we do this archeology.
So it lets us really get a whole nother angle  on what's out there in the Universe  and how the stars came to be, and in the end, of course,  how we came to be out of this whole mess.
AA: Our challenge now  is to be as audacious as possible.
Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build exquisite detectors  that can listen to the Universe,  to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos.
Our job is to dream up and build new observatories --  a whole new generation of observatories --  on the ground, in space.
I mean, what could be more glorious than listening to the Big Bang itself?
Our job now is to dream big.
Dream with us.
Thank you.
