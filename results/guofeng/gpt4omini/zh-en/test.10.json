Chen Ge criticizes the school's management for treating students poorly and explains that the wall separating the campuses symbolizes the school's fear of losing control. He emphasizes that human nature is complex and that attempts to erase memories will ultimately fail.

Chen Ge challenges Zhou Tu's misconceptions, arguing that the East Campus, while perceived as dangerous, provides students with a clearer understanding of their reality and potential for liberation compared to the West Campus, where students live under altered memories and a false sense of happiness. He criticizes the school's management for treating students poorly and explains that the wall separating the campuses symbolizes the school's fear of losing control, emphasizing the complexity of human nature and the futility of erasing memories. This discussion intrigues Zhou Tu and the club members, prompting them to consider exploring the East Campus. Meanwhile, Zhou Tu expresses doubt about realizing his dream studio there, feeling that the timing isn't right. Chen Ge notices a notably stronger shadow in Dormitory 413, which could aid him in leading students back to the East Campus to confront a vengeful spirit, enhancing his own strength and creating new opportunities for threats within the academy. He plans to gather resources discreetly before the school's master discovers his secret. Chen Ge turns to Wang Yicheng, who seems reluctant to allow them into his dormitory. Despite Wang's attempts to dismiss concerns, Chen Ge senses he is hiding something. They observe that while both Wang and Lin Sisi live in Dormitory 413, their respective campuses have differing occupancy. Chen Ge underscores the importance of keeping their club's secrets and remaining discreet due to the presence of various teachers at the school.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 805, titled \"The Last Story,\" Zhou Tu wrestles with warnings from seniors and teachers regarding the dangers of the East Campus. Chen Ge challenges Zhou Tu's misconceptions, arguing that the East Campus offers a clearer understanding of reality and potential liberation, in contrast to the West Campus, where students live under altered memories and false happiness. He criticizes the school's management for mistreating students and explains that the wall separating the campuses symbolizes the school's fear of losing control, highlighting the complexity of human nature and the futility of erasing memories. This discussion intrigues Zhou Tu and his club members, prompting thoughts of exploring the East Campus. However, Zhou Tu doubts the feasibility of realizing his dream studio there, feeling the timing is off. Meanwhile, Chen Ge notices a stronger shadow in Dormitory 413 that could help him confront a vengeful spirit, enhancing his strength and creating new opportunities for threats within the academy. He plans to gather resources discreetly to avoid the school's master's scrutiny and turns to Wang Yicheng, who is hesitant about allowing them into his dormitory. Despite Wang's attempts to downplay concerns, Chen Ge senses he is hiding something. As they observe the differing occupancy between Wang and Lin Sisi in Dormitory 413, Chen Ge emphasizes the need for discretion due to the presence of various teachers. Chen Ge is also on high alert after causing a disturbance in the laboratory, anticipating that school authorities may investigate soon. He plans to check Dormitory 413 and then lay low. The West Campus, bustling with activity across its four dormitory buildings for boys, contrasts sharply with the controlled environment of the East Campus, which has warnings about recent violent incidents. Upon entering Dormitory 413, they encounter a rude boy who confronts Wang Yicheng about closing the door, but Chen Ge intervenes, and the boy backs down. Wang points out Bed No. 4, used for storing luggage, while the others are cluttered with belongings.",
