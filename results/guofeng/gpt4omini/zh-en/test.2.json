        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 1303, tensions rise at the Eastern Palace as the old master expresses anger over impending ancestral arrivals. The leading man reassures him about upcoming plans. The old master reflects on Pei Yi's unexpected visit and the challenges posed by their shared grudge against DK, which seems insurmountable. Pei Yi arrives with An Xiaoning, who remains masked to conceal her identity. They exchange words, with Pei Yi commenting on the effectiveness of her disguise. An Xiaoning explains her need for secrecy, while Pei Yi inquires about her companion, Wu Lianzhi. He then confronts the Eastern Palace, questioning why they would want to harm his sister, prompting a defensive response from the palace's representatives.",

Pei Yi arrives with An Xiaoning, who is masked to conceal her identity, and they exchange words about her disguise. Pei Yi inquires about her companion, Wu Lianzhi, and confronts the Eastern Palace, questioning why they would want to harm his sister. The family's reaction shifts abruptly upon learning about Pei Yi's sister, claiming ignorance. Pei Yi asserts that Donggong Lianzhi, a family member, is involved with An Xiaoning, who is expecting a child, and insists he should not be taken away. An Xiaoning supports Pei Yi, complicating matters further. The old matriarch resists his demands, emphasizing family rules and authority. Wu Lianzhi confronts the palace, declaring he has severed ties with them after a poisoning attempt by his mother and now identifies as Wu Lianzhi. He expresses his determination to dissociate from the Eastern Palace. The matriarch insists that once part of the family, always part of it, but Pei Yi warns her about the potential consequences of their actions, particularly regarding An's safety and the risk of international repercussions.",

The old master reflects on Pei Yi's unexpected visit and the challenges posed by their shared grudge against DK. Pei Yi arrives with An Xiaoning, who is masked to conceal her identity, and they discuss her disguise. He inquires about her companion, Wu Lianzhi, and confronts the Eastern Palace about their intentions towards his sister, leading to an abrupt shift in the family's reaction upon learning about her. Pei Yi asserts that Donggong Lianzhi, a family member, is involved with An Xiaoning, who is expecting a child, insisting he should not be taken away. An Xiaoning supports Pei Yi, complicating matters further. The old matriarch resists his demands, emphasizing family rules and authority, while Wu Lianzhi confronts the palace, declaring his severance from them after a poisoning attempt by his mother. He now identifies as Wu Lianzhi and expresses his determination to dissociate from the Eastern Palace. The matriarch insists that family ties are unbreakable, but Pei Yi warns her about the potential consequences of their actions, particularly regarding An's safety and international repercussions. Wu Lianzhi's boldness prompts Pei Yi to mention his past dealings with An Xiaoning, warning that she would not forgive easily if her life were threatened. Pei Yi insists on taking both An Xiaoning and another person with him, warning against bloodshed. Infuriated, the old matriarch declares that Pei Yi should be removed from the family registry. In a hurry to return to his country, Pei Yi acknowledges a promise to An Xiaoning but wants her to stay with him for five days, despite her insistence on her freedom and desire to limit her stay to two days.",
