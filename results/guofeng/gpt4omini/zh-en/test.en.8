Chapter 455: Reversal 3
"This is just to let you experience the fluctuations in breath; it's really quite simple," another sorcerer beside him couldn't help but interject with a laugh.
"Then it will be hard work for you."
Lin Sheng nodded.
He needed to find the other fragments as quickly as possible; originally, he planned to deal with more evil spirits for greater pure soul power.
However, now that he has encountered such an opportunity, obtaining it as quickly as possible is the way to go.
Soon, the sorcerer leader led Lin Sheng to stand in front of an evil spirit gate.
The two of them reached out and gently touched the edge of the evil spirit gate at the same time, closing their eyes.
The sorcerer leader quickly used his supernatural powers to begin constructing a spatial base as a coordinate establishment.
Then, following the ritual fluctuations of the evil spirit gate, Lin Sheng's perceptual consciousness was taken along and launched together by the ritual fluctuations.
"The ordinary teleportation ritual is a point-to-point directional transmission."
"But when we generally explore other spatial secret realms, we transform this point-to-point into point-to-multiple."
"This only requires a slight modification of a small parameter on the teleportation base."
The sorcerer leader guided Lin Sheng's consciousness while imparting relevant skills.
"In this way, the Evil Spirit Gate will spontaneously transmit our consciousness to multiple possible locations in similar target spaces."
"This is essentially using energy to take a chance; if we're lucky, we can instantly hit the spatial secret realm we desire, but if we're not, we'll have to waste energy and try several times."
"It really is quite random."
Lin Sheng was speechless.
As soon as his perception entered the Evil Spirit Gate, it was immediately enveloped by the ritual fluctuations and launched outward.
At the same time, it was as if his consciousness had split; his perceptual awareness was divided into more than ten parts, simultaneously sensing over ten completely different spatial auras.
"Generally speaking, it is difficult for our consciousness to maintain its integrity during the teleportation process, so we can only try our best to remember the spatial coordinates that the main consciousness comes into contact with."
"Remembering the coordinates requires us to leave a simple marker...."
The sorcerer leader outside continued to explain in a low voice while guiding Lin Sheng, teaching him how to create a simple marker to determine the coordinate code.
But he never expected that the consciousness of the spirit lock, being too powerful and resilient, would allow him to remember all the coordinates of the spaces encountered by the more than ten parts of consciousness that were split off.
It's just a matter of multitasking with more than ten parts of consciousness. For Lin Sheng, whose soul awareness can operate in multiple ways simultaneously, this is nothing extraordinary. He practices techniques that allow him to multitask with dozens of aspects every day.
He can control and observe each summoned creature through his split consciousness. So while he cannot yet control many summoned creatures to act independently at the same time,
But it was merely a matter of remembering the fluctuations of the aura and marking down the coordinates separately.
Moreover, his soul is inherently more resilient than that of an average person, allowing it to endure for a longer period. This aspect is still quite effortless.
Ten minutes later, his consciousness was nearly exhausted and dissipated.
Lin Sheng opened his eyes and looked at the sorcerer leader and the others.
"Locate the spatial secret realm at this coordinate for me." He immediately stated one of the special spatial secret realm coordinates under the astonished gazes of the sorcerer leader and the others.
The spatial secret realm at this coordinate is precisely the special space that Lin Sheng perceives, which shares the same origin as the evil-turning wheel fragment he holds in his arms.
"Did it succeed on the first try?"
The sorcerer leader felt a bit bitter; when he first sensed the spatial aura, determined the coordinates, and recorded them, it took him a full month and a half to succeed.
"It's a very simple operation."
"Let's begin; establish the teleportation gate."
"I want to go over there," Lin Sheng commanded.
"Yes."
"Wait a moment, main body."
The soul transmission from Tiangongxia caused Lin Sheng to hesitate.
"How?"
As he watched the sorcerer leader and the others begin to instruct the evil spirits to move the material resources over, he stepped aside to wait, simultaneously communicating with Tiangongxia through soul transmission in his mind.
"There’s a situation over here. There’s been a major change compared to Shajia Island!"
Tiangongxia's tone was subtly serious.
This is a sign that Lin Sheng has never seen before.
You should know that even when he initially informed Tiangongxia about the existence of the Night King, he had never seen her so serious.
This made him feel a sense of unusual tension.
"Mi Yue should be at a significant disadvantage, right?"
Lin Sheng frowned and asked.
"Or is it that new combat power has joined the fray?"
"No, it's not new combat power," Tiangongxia said solemnly.
"But it was Mi Yue who deceived everyone!"
"??? What’s going on?"
"The Seven Lock Tower has long successfully summoned him; Mi Yue deceived everyone in the three great secret realms, and he has already successfully summoned Farudo! He used himself as the sacrifice and fused with him!"
Lin Sheng's consciousness momentarily froze.
"Using oneself as a sacrifice?"
"......This madman!"
"So now, what the three great secret realms are facing is the fused monster of Mi Yue and Farudo...."
Lin Sheng was left speechless.
"What should we do now?"
Tiangongxia said seriously.
The combination of Farudo and Mi Yue is not as simple as one plus one equals two; it results in something akin to three multiplied by ten.
"Don't get excited."
"For Mi Yue and Farudo, their greatest enemies are still the three great secret realms and the numerous other major powers."
"And this world is not as simple as you think."
Lin Sheng recalled the information he had gathered during his previous investigations.
"The Great Star Pool, along with those holding the Destiny Sacred Artifacts, are not simple characters."
"As long as he doesn't provoke us, we don't care how they develop."
"I understand what you mean."
"However, it's best to prepare early," Tiangongxia reminded.
"I once possessed that level of destructive power. It was during the time I was manipulated by the Demon Sword."
"So I am very clear about what kind of results that level of power would lead to."
Lin Sheng fell silent.
Among all his leaders, Tiangongxia is the most unique one, as she was once influenced and controlled by a certain extraordinary powerful entity.
At that time, she even discovered Lin Sheng's gaze during the memory recall.
It was merely an imprint of an image in her memory, yet she was still able to detect Lin Sheng's gaze peering into her recollections.
Such power has already exceeded Lin Sheng's understanding.
"I understand now," Lin Sheng replied once again.
"I will be well prepared."
"Don't worry."
"At worst, I'll activate the strongest special state, summoning all commanding powers to merge into myself."
Breaking off the connection with Tiangongxia, Lin Sheng quietly gazed at the newly constructed Evil Spirit Gate, his thoughts returning to their original line of reasoning.
"It's ready. My lord," the sorcerer leader said softly.
Lin Sheng stared at the teleportation gate, falling silent for a moment.
"Have the Fairy King come over. Also, Dejael!"
Dejael's demonic hand has long been waiting nearby.
Upon hearing the summons, he immediately walked in from the doorway.
"My lord, I will follow your instructions."
Lin Sheng nodded.
"I want to open multiple teleportation gates simultaneously to explore several evil spirit realms."
"You select one hundred great evil spirits, divide them into different teams, and conduct separate exploratory tests."
"At your command!"
Dejael felt a chill in his heart, realizing that something must have changed with the master.
"Otherwise, there wouldn't be such an urgent large-scale exploration taking place all of a sudden."
