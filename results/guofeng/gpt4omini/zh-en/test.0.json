        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter One: A New Journey, a middle-aged man in leather armor stands on the deck of a wooden merchant ship, admiring the scenic grassland below while discussing business opportunities with a slightly overweight merchant in a robe. The man reflects on initial opposition to expanding their market but feels validated by their decision, though he expresses concern about the dangers of their chosen route, particularly the presence of wind serpents. The merchant downplays these risks, emphasizing that wealth comes from taking chances. Meanwhile, a young man they rescued, Rod, is in a deep sleep after being bandaged by Lijie and is no longer in life-threatening danger. The merchant is worried about the nature of Rod's injuries, which resemble wounds from a giant lizard, raising questions about such creatures in northern Parfield. As Rod regains consciousness, he reflects on his recent battle against the Void Dragon, where he achieved his first kill but was also struck down. Expecting to be resurrected in the game, he instead experienced a blackout and now finds himself in an unfamiliar place, confused about what has happened and questioning if he is still dreaming.",

The man reflects on initial opposition to expanding their market but feels validated by their decision, although he expresses concern about the dangers of their chosen route, particularly the presence of wind serpents. The merchant downplays these risks, emphasizing that wealth comes from taking chances. Meanwhile, a young man they rescued, Rod, is in a deep sleep after being bandaged by Lijie and is no longer in life-threatening danger. The merchant is worried about the nature of Rod's injuries, which resemble wounds from a giant lizard, raising questions about such creatures in northern Parfield. As Rod regains consciousness, he finds himself in an unfamiliar cabin, injured and bandaged, realizing he is not in the virtual reality MMORPG, Dragon Soul Continent, but in reality, where pain can be felt. Confused and in pain, he notices his frail, pale arm, contrasting with the muscular character he created in the game, and wonders how he got injured and where he is, as the room lacks modern amenities. Just then, a blonde girl in a white robe enters, surprised to see him. As Rod reflects on his recent battle against the Void Dragon, where he achieved his first kill but was also struck down, he questions what has happened and if he is still dreaming.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter One: A New Journey, a middle-aged man in leather armor stands on the deck of a wooden merchant ship, admiring the scenic grassland below while discussing business opportunities with a slightly overweight merchant in a robe. The man reflects on initial opposition to expanding their market but feels validated by their decision, though he expresses concern about the dangers of their chosen route, particularly the presence of wind serpents. The merchant downplays these risks, emphasizing that wealth comes from taking chances. Meanwhile, a young man they rescued, Rod, is in a deep sleep after being bandaged by Lijie and is no longer in life-threatening danger. The merchant worries about the nature of Rod's injuries, which resemble wounds from a giant lizard, raising questions about such creatures in northern Parfield. As Rod regains consciousness in an unfamiliar cabin, he realizes he is not in the virtual reality MMORPG, Dragon Soul Continent, but in reality, where pain can be felt. Confused and in pain, he notices his frail, pale arm, contrasting with the muscular character he created in the game, and wonders how he got injured and where he is, as the room lacks modern amenities. Just then, a blonde girl in a white robe enters, speaking Nimu, a language from the game, which he surprisingly understands. She examines his serious injuries on his left shoulder and chest, expressing concern for his recovery. Rod recalls being attacked during a battle with the Void Dragon, and the girl explains that he collapsed in the Parfield Hills and was rescued by the Silver Scales Trading Company's ship. Despite his grim initial condition, she notes that Rod's recovery ability is unexpectedly strong, leaving him to question what has happened and if he is still dreaming.",
