Chapter One: A New Journey
The gale swept through the canyon, stirring up waves across the grassland.
The bison, which was bending down to graze on the tender grass, lifted its head and looked up at the sky.
There, a wooden merchant ship several dozen meters long was floating in the air, its fully unfurled sails billowing in the wind, slowly moving forward.
"No matter when you look at it, this wind tide is always so magnificent."
A middle-aged man clad in leather armor stood beside the deck, gazing down at the endless grassland and the beautiful scenery.
"For us merchants, this is also a rare business opportunity."
Standing beside the middle-aged man was a slightly overweight merchant with a peculiar curly hairstyle, dressed in a merchant's robe. His small eyes were narrowed slightly, as if he were calculating something while observing the scenery before him. From his expression, it seemed as if he could even sell this beautiful view for money.
"If it weren't for it, we probably wouldn't be able to transport the goods to the central region so quickly."
"To be honest, I faced opposition when I initially planned to expand this market, but now it seems that my choice was indeed the right one."
"However, if I may be blunt, you did not choose the major shipping routes and instead took this path. While it may save time, the level of danger will also increase."
"I've heard that things have been quite unsettled on the other side recently. Moreover, I believe the captain has warned you that there seem to be wind serpents lurking around here lately; in case of an emergency..."
The man's expression grew somewhat serious as he turned his head and cast his gaze toward the mountains in the distance.
The towering peaks obscured his view, preventing him from seeing what lay behind.
However, it could be vaguely seen that the distant sky was not a clear blue, but rather tinged with a shade of somber darkness.
That was not a world they should venture into.
"Don't worry, what are the odds of that happening? Wealth is sought through risk, and that's the very reason I am spending such a large sum to hire you!"
"Just a few snakes, isn't it?"
The merchant reached out and patted the man's shoulder.
"By the way, how is the young man we rescued doing now?"
"He's not dead yet, is he?"
"Lijie has already bandaged his wounds, and now he is in a deep sleep; he should be out of any life-threatening danger."
"That will do."
Hearing the man's response, the merchant nodded in satisfaction, but he quickly furrowed his brows.
"However, what kind of injury did that young man actually sustain? From the look of the wound, it resembles that of a giant lizard—but are there such peculiar creatures in the northern part of Parfield?"
"I’m not sure either, my lord, but it must be a very fierce beast. I hope we don’t encounter it."
As he spoke, the man instinctively glanced at the entrance of the cabin before turning his head back to gaze ahead.
Rod opened his eyes.
What happened?
He stared blankly at the ceiling in front of him, his mind a blur.
He remembered that he had previously been leading his team in battle against the most powerful boss in the Dragon Soul Continent, the Void Dragon, on a ruined high platform, and they had successfully achieved the first kill. He was certain that he had received both the achievement and the system notification; however, the Void Dragon's final strike had also taken his life.
According to the original plan, Rod was supposed to be resurrected in the cemetery and then log out.
However, just at the moment he was struck down by the Void Dragon, the entire world immediately turned pitch black, as if he had been forcibly isolated, and then Rod lost consciousness.
How is this possible?
Is it possible that there is a problem with the game?
Rod managed to turn his head and could see the blue sky and white clouds outside the window. Where am I?
What place is this?
What exactly happened?
Is he still dreaming?
Am I still in the game?
At least Rod could be sure that this place was definitely not his cramped rental apartment.
Thinking of this, confusion immediately flooded Rod's mind. He frowned and then tried to sit up.
"Woo!!!"
At that moment, a sudden surge of pain shot through Rod's chest, and he gritted his teeth, halting his movements.
At this moment, Rod realized that his left shoulder and chest were completely wrapped in bandages. Although he didn't know what had happened, the dark stains seeping through clearly indicated that he was seriously injured.
This is definitely not a game!
Rod could be certain of this; after all, although technology has advanced significantly and the Dragon Soul Continent, as the world's first virtual reality MMORPG, employs a great deal of high-tech innovations, according to the rules, players cannot experience pain. This is designed to help distinguish between reality and the game, while also considering the reduction of barriers for players.
Instead of simulating pain when players are injured, the game employs a series of methods to warn and remind players by reducing their movement speed and obscuring their vision with a red overlay that signifies danger, rather than actually replicating the sensation of pain.
Such behavior had sparked considerable debate in society when holographic simulation technology first emerged, and the operating company of the Dragon Soul Continent would naturally be aware of this.
Rod lowered his head, staring at his right hand, which was not the character he had created in the game, not that muscular and wild body.
On the contrary, the arm before him was thin and frail, its skin a somewhat sickly pale due to years of not being exposed to the sun.
This is his body in reality, and he is very clear about that.
But how did I get injured?
Moreover, this doesn't seem like a hospital, does it?
Rod looked up, and the entire room appeared to be a cabin, with no lights, no phone, and certainly no call bell.
A wooden table, two chairs, and a cabinet fixed to the wall are all the possessions here.
For some reason, Rod felt as if he had seen this scene somewhere before.
And just as Rod was carefully examining the room, the door suddenly swung open.
A blonde girl in a white robe walked into the room; she looked at Rod, who was half sitting up, and widened her eyes in surprise.
"You're awake? That's great!!"
The language the girl spoke was neither Chinese nor English, yet Rod was able to clearly understand what she was saying.
This surprised Rod; he recognized the language.
"This is Nimu, one of the official languages of the Dragon Soul Continent!"
“How do you feel? Are you okay?”
However, the girl did not pay attention to Rod's expression; she quickly walked to his side and began to carefully examine his left shoulder and chest.
"Your injuries are quite serious. To be honest, I'm a bit worried about whether you can pull through..."
"This is……"
Rod furrowed his brow, unsure of what to say. He turned his head to look at the mirror on the wall beside him, where his face was clearly reflected. That was indeed his face, but it shouldn’t be here.
"Did you forget?"
The blonde girl blinked her eyes in confusion, and her ponytails swayed slightly with her movements. Her bright blue eyes were clear and transparent, giving off a lively impression.
"Two days ago, you collapsed in the Parfield Hills and sustained quite serious injuries."
"If it weren't for the merchant ship of the 'Silver Scales' Trading Company passing by, things would have been quite dire."
"I really don't know what you fought against; the left side of your body sustained quite serious injuries, and it was truly very dangerous at that time."
"Wait, left shoulder?"
Rod paused for a moment, and it immediately came to his mind that during the final moments of his battle against the Void Dragon, it was indeed his left side that had been attacked.
But that was his character getting injured in the game; it shouldn't have anything to do with the player himself, right? Yet now, the one who is injured is him?
Although the situation before him was chaotic, Rod quickly calmed down. This was a testament to his mental fortitude as a top-tier player and the leader of the world's most powerful MMORPG guild.
In conversing with the blonde girl before him, Rod learned about his current situation: he had sustained serious injuries and collapsed in the Parfield Plains, and it was the floating ship of the Silver Scales Trading Company that happened to pass by and rescued him.
According to the blonde girl, Rod's initial condition was quite grim, but his recovery ability was surprisingly good.
"My name is Lijie Noaer, and I am a member of the Star Moon Mercenary Corps, a spirit master. You can just call me Lijie."
The girl confidently introduced herself to Rod.
"My name is Rod Ailante."
Although he couldn't make sense of the situation in front of him yet, Rod hesitated for a moment before revealing his identity and ID from the game.
"I am an adventurer from the Eastern Highlands."
"An adventurer, I see, that’s why you were all alone in such a remote mountain deep in the wilderness."
Upon hearing Rod's response, Lijie was not surprised, as many adventurers on this continent prefer to explore alone, so Rod's stated identity was not an issue.
"But what exactly were you fighting against?"
"How did you get such serious injuries?"
"I remember that there shouldn't be any particularly terrifying monsters in this plain area."
Hearing the girl's question, Rod smiled awkwardly.
What could he possibly say? Should he tell Lijie that he was injured while fighting against the Void Dragon, one of the so-called Five Dragons of Creation?
"Because I was attacked at night, I couldn't see clearly what my opponent was; there were many of them, and they were fast. I think, perhaps, they were the creatures from 'over there.'"
"I understand."
Although Rod didn't provide a detailed explanation, Lijie seemed to understand something as she nodded, then she carefully finished examining Rod's wounds before standing up.
"Having not eaten for two days, I imagine you're very hungry. Please wait a moment; I'll go get something to eat right away."
"Ah, right, I also need to report this to the captain; I think he will come to see you soon."
After saying this, the girl politely nodded slightly to Rod and then turned to leave the room.
