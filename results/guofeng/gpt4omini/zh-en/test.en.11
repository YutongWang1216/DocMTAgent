Chapter 834: Return to the Holy Land (Part Two)
"Zhuque."
Inside the bamboo house, Bai Yan was watching Bai Xiaochen and Xiao Long'er play and frolic. Suddenly, she heard a commotion outside and furrowed her brows, asking, "What is happening outside? Why is there so much noise?"
"Go outside and take a look."
"Zhuque clenched her fists, accepted the order, and after a while, she pushed open the door of the bamboo house and walked in, hesitantly saying, 'Your Majesty, there are two people outside looking for you...'"
"Looking for me?"
Bai Yan raised her eyebrows and said, "Then I'll go outside to see who is looking for me."
With that, she slowly stood up from her chair and walked towards the door.
Outside the house, beneath the blood-red sky, two figures trembled as they crawled from the front. Perhaps it was the countless paths they had crawled that caused a trail of blood to flow beneath them, which caught Bai Yan's eye, particularly jarring.
"What are you doing?"
Bai Yan furrowed her brows slightly and asked coldly.
The Second Elder's face was pale, and his trembling body crawled on the ground as he stammered, "Your Majesty, I have come to confess my sins to you. That day, I was deceived by that imposter, which led you to misunderstand the King. It was all my fault, and I am willing to accept any punishment. Please, Your Majesty, show mercy."
"No, Your Majesty, it is my fault. I failed to deliver the King's orders to you. In fact, that day the King left the palace to lift the seal on the demon realm, and he instructed me to return and inform you, but I was unable to do so, which gave the villain an opportunity."
Huo Yu knelt on the ground, his face full of tears: "All the mistakes are mine, Your Majesty. If you wish to hit or scold me, I will not say a word." He took the bamboo strips from behind him, placed them in his palms, and presented them to Bai Yan, deeply bowing his head with an expression of one ready to face death.
Bai Yan's hand slowly grasped the bamboo strips that Huo Yu had dragged before her; her expression was calm, and her gaze contained an inscrutable brilliance.
It seemed that he sensed the bamboo strips slipping from his grasp; Huo Yu's body stiffened, and he clenched his teeth tightly, bracing himself for the impending blow that would come like a bolt from the blue.
However...
For a long time, there was no pain.
Huo Yu looked up in astonishment, only to see the bamboo strips in Bai Yan's hand burst into flames, instantly turning to ashes.
"What hardships have you endured crawling all this way?"
"Y-Your Majesty?"
Huo Yu looked at Bai Yan in confusion, perhaps not understanding the meaning of her words.
"Since that is the case, your sins have been repaid in full. Rise."
Bai Yan has always been a person who distinguishes right from wrong clearly. She only targets those who wish to harm her.
On that day, if she could be deceived, how could the Grand Elder and Huo Yu be any different? Therefore, she had never held any grievances against them...
Huo Yu's body was as rigid as iron, unable to believe that Bai Yan had let them go so easily.
Before coming, they had already prepared to be covered in bruises!
Now, she hasn't even struck them once, yet she has absolved them of their sins.
Seeing the two of them kneeling motionless on the ground, Bai Yan's expression slightly darkened: "What's wrong?"
"Are you still waiting for me to help you up?"
The woman's sharp voice reached Huo Yu's ears, startling him into immediately scrambling to his feet, his pants soaked with blood, struggling to maintain his balance.
Even so, he still stood on the ground, trembling legs refusing to kneel down again.
Bai Yan glanced at the two of them, struggling to support themselves, and pointed to the stone seat on the ground: "Sit down; you can head down the mountain after resting for a while."
