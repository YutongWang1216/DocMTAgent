Chapter 210: The Matters of the Governor and the Empress Dowager 64
For a moment, Xiao Mo was deeply moved, feeling a surge of sorrow.
The Governor is... hesitant to act, isn't he?
Once his body moved, his mind would also start to function; how could he, being so intelligent, not know that Bai Weiwei was already dead?
He was unwilling to admit it and dared not think too deeply, so he could only force himself to sit there, convincing himself that Bai Weiwei was merely asleep and would wake up.
Xiao Mo felt that only when Bai Weiwei's body began to decay would the Governor truly regain his sanity and realize that the person he was holding hands with had been dead for a long time.
However, what was strange was that Bai Weiwei's body showed no signs of change at all.
Even her pale complexion had improved quite a bit; although her body was cold, it undoubtedly seemed as if she were merely asleep.
Not a single characteristic of a corpse had appeared.
Mu Yanjun kept watch over her, his eyes growing brighter.
The old divine physician has finally been brought in; he was eating a heart-protecting pill and said, "I estimate that my old life has probably already gone for more than half."
Mu Yanjun had not slept for five days, and anyone could see how exhausted he was.
But he was unusually alert, alarmingly and unnaturally so.
"Since I gave her the medicine, she has been asleep like this. I think it's time to ask you to come and see when she will wake up."
The old man sighed and then walked to the bedside to check Bai Weiwei's pulse.
"Actually, this phenomenon is extremely rare, and there's no need for treatment; however, there is one particularly important thing that needs to be done..."
Mu Yanjun listened intently, like a good student, with a fire burning in his eyes.
The old man’s voice lowered, "It means I have to treat another person now..."
Mu Yanjun leaned forward, unwilling to miss a word he said.
The old man’s movements were as swift as lightning, and in an instant, a needle pierced into his neck.
Mu Yanjun's eyes suddenly widened, and his hand was already slapping towards the old man's crown.
Xiao Mo's hand shot out, intercepting Mu Yanjun's attack.
With the back and forth, Mu Yanjun could no longer hold on and fainted.
The old man rubbed his head and said, "I almost died, but I estimate I won't live much longer either. If he wakes up and isn't crazy, that would be good enough."
Bai Weiwei cannot be saved.
Mu Yanjun's condition was simply one of deep sorrow penetrating his very soul, with all his internal organs showing signs of distress.
He neither eats nor sleeps, does not think or move, resembling a living corpse; if this continues for another couple of days, he will likely be gone along with Bai Weiwei.
Xiao Mo looked at the old man and said, "You are protecting the life of my Governor; if you fail to do so this time, I will kill you myself."
After speaking, she turned and walked towards the place where they would be punished, silently accepting her fate.
The old man sighed, "No wonder my master said that even selling sweet potatoes can't make one a divine physician. Everyone treats me like a god, but even a god can't keep someone who wants to die alive."
Mu Yanjun had only slept for two hours when his eyes flew open.
He was taken aback, his eyes rarely showing panic, but he found himself unable to move.
The old man saw that he was awake and said, "I'm going to give you acupuncture. You're in a weakened state, but if you take some time to recuperate, you should be ready to meet Yan Wang."
Mu Yanjun's gaze darkened, his complexion pale and haggard, yet he exuded a fierce aura that sent chills down one's spine.
The old man gave him another acupuncture needle and said, "I didn't really want to save you, after all, a person like you is incredibly malicious; if I brought you back to life, who knows what kind of chaos would ensue in this world."
Mu Yanjun's voice was soft yet eerie, "Let go of me."
The old man shook his head and said, "That won't do; I can't save the one you hold dear. If I save you, that would be compensation enough."
Mu Yanjun suddenly laughed bitterly, "You can't compensate her; how could you possibly make up for it? Even if you saved everyone in this world, you wouldn't be able to repay her a single hair."
