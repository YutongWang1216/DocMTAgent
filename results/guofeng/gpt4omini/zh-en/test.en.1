Chapter 1064: The Doom of Arrowhead Corporation
Amidst the bombardment from the mortars, chaos reigned within the base, and no one even noticed that a special forces unit had infiltrated the camp.
Without much effort, Kutepov placed the beacon on the designated target, then withdrew with his team from the base. After safely reaching the extraction point, he called in an airstrike.
Soon, the Russian stealth bombers swooped down from above the clouds, dropping four precision-guided munitions that accurately struck two ammunition depots and two fuel storage facilities within the base.
The shockwave from the explosion swept across the entire camp, directly collapsing a ring of concrete structures surrounding it.
The exploding munitions and burning flames flew across the camp, triggering a series of chain reactions, with flames everywhere, and blood and corpses strewn about.
The guards stationed at the camp suffered nearly half of their forces in an instant, and most of the remaining personnel were injured, making it nearly impossible to find a single unscathed individual.
The medics carried stretchers as they moved through the base, searching for incapacitated wounded soldiers.
The engineers, clad in heavy bomb disposal suits, bravely charged into the fire scene, dragging out munitions that had not yet exploded from the rubble.
The soldiers who were still able to move all got up, searching for their units to regroup.
Salders gazed out at the flames, a layer of despair gradually imprinting itself in his vacant eyes.
Thick smoke shrouded the entire base, and the flames dyed the night sky a deep red, resembling the end of the world.
"Shett..."
Muttering to himself, he moved his leaden legs and slowly stepped away from the window.
Turning around, he made eye contact with the staff officer from the command center.
"Commander, what... should we do?"
The aftershocks of the explosion finally subsided, and no more sounds of munitions detonating echoed through the base. However, everyone's mood remained restless. The mercenaries who had narrowly escaped the blast were acutely aware that what followed was only the beginning of their nightmare.
The earlier explosion seemed to ignite some kind of signal, sounding the horn for the Sami forces' assault.
At Jiang Chen's behest, the Sami seized this fleeting opportunity, standing before everyone with raised arms, leading the remaining insurgents to charge the front lines.
More than six thousand people were running across the tundra, charging toward the flickering flames in the pine forest.
From a distance, the scene was truly spectacular.
Meanwhile, as they gazed at the thick smoke rising from the base behind them, all the mercenaries fighting on the front lines fell into a state of panic, their previously high morale plummeting to an all-time low in an instant.
When faced with the surging tide of rioters, even if they had the strength to hold the line, they had no desire to continue fighting.
There was no doubt that the Arrowhead Corporation's defenses had been breached, and the resisting mercenaries collapsed under the Sami forces' overwhelming human wave tactics.
A portion of the people fled back into the burning base, but the majority deserted, escaping into the depths of the woods.
There’s no need for Jiang Chen to remind them; even a pig should know what to do at a time like this.
Watching the Sami lead the insurgents in their assault on the military base, Jiang Chen put away his binoculars and summoned the all-terrain motorcycle he had prepared in advance from the storage compartment, gently patting Aisha on the back.
"It's about time; let's set off as well."
"Uh-huh!"
Aisha nodded in agreement, and after Jiang Chen sat on the motorcycle, she swiftly mounted it behind him.
The engine roared with a low growl as the tires churned up a layer of crushed snow.
Jiang Chen rode the all-terrain motorcycle down the slope, circling around to the side of the base with Aisha. He parked the motorcycle by the roadside, shook out a lightsaber from the storage compartment, and casually waved it a couple of times before effortlessly slicing through the wire-mesh barrier.
The entire base was engulfed in fire and chaos, with the occasional deafening blast of mortars echoing through the air. All the mercenaries capable of wielding a weapon rushed to the front lines, battling the rioters for control of the main entrance to the base.
Aside from a security squad stationed in front of the command post, the entire rear area was virtually deserted.
For Jiang Chen and Aisha, this was no different from being unprotected.
A total of ten guards were stationed, with two guards on the watchtower and the remaining eight positioned at the entrances on the first and second floors.
Aisha retrieved her Ghost sniper rifle and silently took out the two guards stationed in the watchtower, then, using the blind spots in her line of sight, systematically eliminated the eight individuals at the entrances on both the first and second floors.
After Aisha dealt with the guard squad outside the command post, Jiang Chen took out his rifle and stepped towards the front entrance. Just as he passed by the Humvee at the entrance, he unexpectedly collided with Salders, who was fleeing in panic from the command post, along with the staff officers.
As their gazes met, both sides clearly paused for a moment.
The staff officer was the first to react, quickly reaching into his chest to draw his gun; however, before his hand could touch his chest, Aisha, who was quicker to respond, shot him in the head.
Salders was about to resist, but was easily subdued by Jiang Chen, who pinned his hands behind his back against the nearby Humvee.
"Salders, male, 43 years old."
"Am I correct in saying that I serve as the General Manager of Arrowhead Corporation and also hold the position of Supreme Commander?"
Although it was their first meeting, the holographic helmet connected to the Phantom Operative database on Jiang Chen's head stored his photo and personal information.
It was just a brief encounter, yet information about him was projected onto the holographic screen.
With his face pressed against the hood of the vehicle, Salders, displaying some grit, stubbornly refused to surrender and gritted his teeth as he spoke.
"I won't say anything; just kill me..."
"Kill you?"
"I haven't asked anything yet."
Jiang Chen grinned and didn't care at all about his uncooperative attitude; he freed his right hand and pulled out a syringe, unceremoniously plunging it into the back of his shoulder.
"Ugh—!"
A defiant roar escaped Salders' throat as he stared wide-eyed with bloodshot eyes, but soon the spark in his pupils faded.
Jiang Chen simply released his grip on him; there was no precedent for an ordinary person to resist after being injected with a truth serum.
Flipping Salders over, Jiang Chen asked slowly and deliberately.
"Where is Carmen?"
"In the research facility of the underground bunker..."
"Where is the underground bunker?"
"The entrance is located in the center of the base and can only be accessed via the lift."
"Next to the entrance, there are two helipads; you can see them as you walk over."
After a question-and-answer exchange, Jiang Chen quickly obtained the information he wanted.
"Very well, now you can have your wish."
Jiang Chen pulled out his pistol and fired another shot into his head, then tossed his body aside.
This is quite a swift way to die, but for the illustrious General Manager of Arrowhead Corporation, Mr. Salders, passing away in such an unremarkable manner might be more painful than death itself... if the dead could feel pain.
"An underground bunker?"
Gazing toward the center of the base, Jiang Chen's lips curled into a cold smile.
"Whatever Carmen is still plotting, his good luck is about to run out."
The fate of the Rothschild family will rise to prominence with the onset of war, only to fade into obscurity with its conclusion...
However, at that moment, a piercing scream echoed from afar.
