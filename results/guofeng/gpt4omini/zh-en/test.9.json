        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 70, titled \"Lord of the East Cave (Part Eight),\" Miao Yi and his companions investigate a loud noise that reveals the shattered stone archway of the East Cave, which has been destroyed. As the newly appointed master of the East Cave, Miao Yi expresses his anger and suspicion towards Song Fu and his group, believing they might be responsible for the destruction. Despite their insistence that they were occupied with a gathering and away from their posts due to a lack of support staff, Miao Yi remains unconvinced, questioning how such a significant structure could have fallen without external cause. Pressured, Song Fu swears on his ancestors' honor that his sect is not responsible for the incident, while Miao Yi expresses concern that someone may be causing trouble in the East Cave, prompting the crowd to disperse and search the area. Miao Yi questions why Song Fu and others aren't investigating if they are innocent, leading to rising tensions as Song Fu urges the crowd to obey Miao Yi's orders. Miao Yi then calls Song Fu to follow him, while a mysterious figure, Old Bai, observes the situation and reflects on the nature of strength and kindness before vanishing. An oppressive atmosphere lingers in the East Cave as Song Fu stands behind Miao Yi, who remains silent and turned away, prompting Song Fu to inquire about Miao Yi's intentions.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 70, titled \"Lord of the East Cave (Part Eight),\" Miao Yi and his companions investigate a loud noise that reveals the shattered stone archway of the East Cave, which has been destroyed. As the newly appointed master of the East Cave, Miao Yi expresses his anger and suspicion towards Song Fu and his group, believing they might be responsible for the destruction. Despite their insistence that they were occupied with a gathering and away from their posts due to a lack of support staff, Miao Yi remains unconvinced, questioning how such a significant structure could have fallen without external cause. Pressured, Song Fu swears on his ancestors' honor that his sect is not responsible, but Miao Yi's concern that someone may be causing trouble in the East Cave prompts the crowd to disperse and search the area. Miao Yi also confronts Song Fu about abandoning his post at the mountain gate, questioning his loyalty and authority. Dismissive and smirking, Song Fu claims he left only to satisfy his hunger and insists he could defend himself against any accusations. Miao Yi, unimpressed, notes that others had not found any suspicious individuals but identifies Song Fu as the culprit. As reinforcements arrive, they quickly close the hall doors and attack Song Fu, who fights back valiantly but is ultimately overpowered and fatally wounded by two spears. Meanwhile, a mysterious figure, Old Bai, observes the situation, reflecting on the nature of strength and kindness before vanishing, leaving an oppressive atmosphere lingering in the East Cave as Miao Yi remains silent and turned away, prompting Song Fu to inquire about his intentions.",
