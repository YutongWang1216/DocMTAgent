Chapter 1898: Unthinkable, Yet Hard to Forget (Part Four)
Yan Rushi gave her a white eye and said, "Wen Xuxu, you're being narcissistic."
"Is it possible that I don't look good?"
Wen Xuxu frowned, pouting her lips and pretending to be angry.
Yan Rushi was taken aback for a moment, then burst into laughter. Supporting Xuxu's upper body with one hand, he pinched her chest firmly.
He glared at her with his head lowered, gritting his teeth, "… cunning foolish woman."
He quickened his pace and walked to the side of the bed, showing no tenderness at all as he directly tossed Xuxu onto the bed. Then, without waiting for a moment, he began to unbutton his shirt one button at a time.
He unbuckled his belt, removed all the constraints from his body, then dove into the quilt, pressing down on Xuxu.
Simple and crude, not beautiful at all.
His deep black eyes met hers, and Xuxu's heartbeat accelerated uncontrollably.
Yes, after being together for so many years, every time she locked eyes with him, her heart still raced like a startled deer, feeling shy and awkward.
Perhaps it was because they were too familiar with each other, she always felt a bit embarrassed.
That's why people say it's hard to make a move on acquaintances, and that rabbits don't eat the grass near their burrows; it's truly like that.
Seeing Xuxu blush and feel shy, Yan Rushi was both excited and frustrated; the excitement was a natural hormonal response within him, while the frustration stemmed from his inner thoughts.
Although he liked to see her shy appearance, he didn't like it when she acted awkwardly because of her shyness; she was always so reserved and never took the initiative.
"What else do you want to hear? I've told you everything; just look at me."
Yan Rushi cupped Xuxu's face with both hands, forcing her to meet his gaze.
Xuxu's face turned even redder as she pouted, her gaze flickering uncertainly. "Then hurry up and tell me, did you steal the love letter someone else wrote for me?"
"Uh..."
Yan Rushi, in a contemplative manner, thought aloud, "Besides Zhao Zheng's love letter, Jiang Zhuoheng's chocolate and movie tickets, there's also the colorful candy from Hao Bang, the son of Director Hao from the Public Security Bureau, who is a year above us."
Upon hearing this, Xuxu was quite surprised. "What? Hao Bang?"
That so-called "the one praised by thousands" science top student?
The reason he is called "the one praised by thousands" is because of his name, not because he is truly praised by thousands; just by calling his name, it is a compliment in itself.
At that time, when she heard this name and realized that there was indeed someone at school with that name, she felt quite disheartened.
Isn't that guy just a bookworm? How could he possibly give her gifts?
"Yeah, that name is really cheap, and the person who came up with it is even cheaper."
Yan Rushi said with a look of disdain, "Fortunately, I ate that lollipop for you. The colorful layers are all dyed with artificial coloring, and it left my tongue and lips all sorts of colors at the time—junk food, cheap stuff."
Xuxu: "..."
According to what he said, should she thank him for eating something someone else gave her?
Xuxu found it both infuriating and amusing. Unable to hold back, she reached out and poked Yan Rushi's forehead hard. "Yan Rushi, why don't you just go to heaven?"
He really loves to take advantage and then act all innocent; this is exactly the kind of thing he enjoys the most.
After saying that, she looked at him and asked with a laugh, "So the reason you didn't like Director Hao before was because of Hao Bang?"
Although it was a question, her tone was certain.
"..." Yan Rushi pouted in silence, which was his way of conceding.
Xuxu, without thinking, fell into his deep black eyes again. She pouted and let out a small "uh," her gaze awkwardly shifting elsewhere.
Then she asked, "How did you manage all this? How come I didn't know about it?"
She pouted, as if trying to find something to say.
