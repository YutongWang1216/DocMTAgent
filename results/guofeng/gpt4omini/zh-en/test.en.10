Chapter 805: The Last Story
"At the East Campus?"
Zhou Tu hesitated for a moment; both the seniors and the teachers had warned the freshmen not to approach the East Campus. They did not specify the exact reasons, but from the tone of their voices, it was clear that the East Campus was very dangerous.
"You have a deep misunderstanding of the East Campus; it is actually quite similar to here, only the management methods of the two campuses are completely different. They live in real terror, while you live in a false sense of happiness."
Chen Ge looked into Zhou Tu's eyes and said, "In comparison to you, they are actually closer to hope, because at least they know who they are and how to find liberation."
Chen Ge did not deceive Zhou Tu; whether it was the students from the East Campus or the West Campus, they were all trapped in this school.
The memories of the students from the West Campus have been altered, repeating the life created by the puppet master, while the students from the East Campus at least know how to look for scapegoats and find ways to escape.
"Are the students from the East School closer to hope?"
"But I heard that only the unwanted trash from the West Campus would be sent there."
Zhou Tu had been persuaded, but he still felt somewhat uneasy inside.
"No matter what the criteria are, any school that treats students like trash is definitely a garbage school."
Chen Ge pointed at the tall wall between the two campuses: "Do you know why that wall exists?"
"Why?"
"Because the school is afraid of losing control, they use various methods to reshape human nature, but they forget that human nature is the most complex thing in this world."
"The event has already happened; no matter how hard we try to forget, the scars will always be imprinted on our hearts."
"Not remembering anything does not mean they do not exist, so certain plans of this school are destined to fail."
Chen Ge spoke some words that the club members did not understand; they did not know why Chen Ge said this, but they felt that there seemed to be some truth in what he was saying.
The children's curiosity was already strong, and Chen Ge continuously revealed the truth about this school to them, ultimately sparking the interest of the club members.
"Shall we head over there now?"
"To be honest, I really don't believe there could be a studio like the one in my dreams in the East Campus," Zhou Tu said quietly.
"Now is not the time."
Chen Ge glanced back at the shadow; the dark figure in Dormitory 413 was still asleep, but his body had already undergone significant changes.
If one looks closely, they will notice that Chen Ge's shadow is different from the others, pitch-black as ink, as if all light that touches it would be swallowed up.
It seems to have become much stronger.
The immense potential of the dark figure is a good thing for Chen Ge; once he awakens, Chen Ge will lead the students back to the East Campus to once again hunt down the solitary vengeful spirit.
By doing this, not only can he enhance his own strength, but he can also stir up the stagnant waters of the school, providing cover for another "killer" within the academy.
"Right now is still a stage of gathering strength; before the master of the school discovers this little insect of mine, I need to prepare as many trump cards for myself as possible."
Chen Ge turned to Wang Yicheng; he had already learned the stories of the other three club members, and only this limping boy, who had joined the club first, remained: "The next place we are going to is Wang Yicheng's dormitory."
"Are we going to my dormitory?"
Wang Yicheng reacted somewhat strangely after hearing this; he waved his hands repeatedly, saying, "Let's forget it; there's nothing worth seeing in my dormitory."
"When you said that, your voice was higher than usual, your speech quickened, and your gaze was wandering; you really aren't good at lying, kid."
Chen Ge gently put his arm around Wang Yicheng's shoulder and asked, "Why don't you want us to come over?"
"What are you worried we might see?"
"I..."
Wang Yicheng thought for a long time but couldn't figure out what to say; finally, he turned his gaze elsewhere and said, "It's nothing, let's just go directly."
"Okay."
Wang Yicheng lives in Dormitory 413 on the West Campus, while Lin Sisi resides in Dormitory 413 on the East Campus.
The dormitory numbers are exactly the same, but in Dormitory 413 on the West Campus, there are students in all the beds except for Bed No. 4, while it is the opposite in the East Campus, where only Bed No. 4 is occupied and all the other beds are empty.
"Let's keep the secrets of our club to ourselves and try to be low-key; there are teachers in this school like me, but there are also some who are not so easy to talk to."
Chen Ge remains vigilant at all times; the commotion they caused in the laboratory building was too loud, and the school authorities are likely already beginning their investigation.
"I don't have much time left; after checking Dormitory 413, I need to lay low for a while."
There are a total of four dormitory buildings for boys on the West Campus, housing several times more students than the East Campus. The lights are still on, making it the liveliest time in the boys' dormitory, with sounds of washing up, plastic basins dropping, and conversations clearly audible even from downstairs.
"This building is similar to the East Campus."
Chen Ge acted very naturally, following behind the four students as they entered the first building together.
The door to the dormitory supervisor's small residence is tightly closed, but the window is open. Inside, a woman in her fifties is humming a tune, and she appears to be in a good mood.
Next to the small window, there is a notice that reads: "Students are prohibited from using high-power appliances in the dormitory, and cooking in the dormitory is not allowed."
"I remember that the notice on the East Campus dormitory building mentioned something like â€” there have been recent violent incidents, and students are prohibited from going out after lights out."
Separated by a wall, they are almost two different worlds, much like the difference between the "inside" and the "outside" of a door.
Walking through the corridor, Chen Ge and several club members arrived at the door of Dormitory 413.
"This dormitory is not much different from the others."
Wang Yicheng opened the door, and once he entered the room, the others in the dormitory seemed to ignore him completely, going about their own business without a word to him.
As Wang Yicheng took a few steps inside, the boy sleeping by the door suddenly lifted the mosquito net and glared at him, saying, "How many times do I have to say it?"
"Close the door behind you when you come in. Is your leg crippled, or is your hearing bad too?"
The boy spoke very unpleasantly; he didn't know why he seemed to dislike Wang Yicheng so much.
"He didn't close the door because someone else is coming in behind him. If you need an apology, we can apologize on his behalf; we just don't know what kind of apology you require."
Chen Ge grasped the doorknob and entered the room, casting a glance at the others in the dormitory.
The boy under the mosquito net immediately backed down upon seeing Chen Ge, falling silent and pulling the net shut with a sullen expression.
"Teacher Bai, this is Bed No. 4. Since no one is occupying it, we use it to store our luggage."
Wang Yicheng pointed to Bed No. 4, which had several suitcases thrown on it; only his luggage was stored under his own bed, while the others had tossed their clutter and belongings onto Bed No. 4.
Chen Ge was very familiar with Bed No. 4; he had lain on Bed No. 4 in the East Campus himself.
As he walked up to Bed No. 4, he noticed that although it was unoccupied, it was still made up with blankets and sheets, though those bedding items were now stained by the luggage and clutter on top of them.
