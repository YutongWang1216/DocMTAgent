Chapter 437: Hit a Brick Wall
At this moment, as the Blue Silver Golden Light Array was unleashed, the flames suddenly dimmed for a moment, being drawn downward.
But that Fire Gourd was clearly not so easy to deal with; it suddenly inhaled with great force, actually siphoning away a portion of the flames, and then with a "whoosh," it shot off to one side, breaking free from the range of the Blue Silver Golden Light Array.
The changes occurred so rapidly that it left one feeling somewhat dazzled.
This person is tough to deal with!
We must take it down quickly, or the Enforcers will be here.
The Fire Gourd spewed downward, and that woman reappeared, her eyes filled with murderous intent. "What are you doing?"
Just as she was speaking, a flash of golden light appeared beneath her feet, and a circle of magnificent patterns quietly emerged, causing the woman's body to stiffen instantly.
Tang Wulin's Blue Silver Grass coiled upward, while Ye Xinglan's Star God's Sword pointed forward, aiming at the opponent's chest. Xie Xie had already silently approached behind her, the Light Dragon Dagger poised at her neck.
It's all a trap!
What could be better than Xu Xiaoyan's Starlight Chains for dealing with a single opponent?
The absolute establishment of Starlight Chains is truly a defiance of the heavens!
Just as everyone let out a sigh of relief, thinking they had subdued their opponent, an unexpected change occurred! The Star God's Sword was already in front of them, and the sharpness of the Light Dragon Dagger had reached her neck. Faced with the threat to her life, the woman's eyes suddenly lit up.
A loud phoenix cry resonated from her body, and immediately after, an overwhelming and unmatched soul power erupted from within her. It was as if she had been stimulated; circles of fiery red light shimmered beneath her clothing, appearing as a series of halos positioned around her neck, shoulders, elbows, waist, and knees. The moment these fiery red lights appeared, an incredibly fierce soul power suddenly exploded from the woman.
It was many times stronger than before; the soul power surged forth, transforming into a massive fiery ring that burst outwards. A layer of intricate golden patterns appeared on the Fire Gourd floating in the air, which had originally been only one foot tall but now soared to two feet, growing several circles larger.
The powerful fluctuations of the fire element erupted instantly, violently knocking Tang Wulin and the others away, and the flames burned at their soul power like maggots burrowing into bone.
The phoenix cry grew even louder, and a majestic aura radiated from the woman, immediately followed by pieces of dark red armor that swiftly appeared, covering her entire body.
On her head was a distinctive phoenix helmet that enveloped her head, while the dark red armor extended outwards on both sides, its elegant streamlined shape continuing downward in a curved manner, accentuating her feminine features. The soft lines at her shoulders enveloped and covered her entire arms.
The dark red flame patterns covered the armor, and on the chest plate, there was a golden-red phoenix design. The armor was not particularly ornate, but with this set of armor enveloping her, the woman's aura had already risen several levels.
Tang Wulin blurted out, his face already filled with a bitter smile.
The battle armor, yes, this is indeed the battle armor! Judging by its complexity and the fluctuations of its aura, it should be a one-word battle armor. The circles of halos appearing around the woman are the tools used to store the battle armor.
A one-word battle armor cannot yet be integrated into the battle armor master’s body.
But even so, this is a complete one-word battle armor!
This meant that the woman, who originally possessed a five-ring cultivation level, had her power directly elevated to the seven-ring realm.
At this moment, Yan Feng was very angry; she had been in a particularly good and happy mood today. Just earlier, she had gone to the Heavenly Spirit Transmission Tower to register, officially becoming a one-word battle armor master.
A battle armor master is a top-tier existence that any organization would be willing to support. Just recently, when signing the contract, the Transmission Tower promised her a series of welfare policies. At just twenty-seven years old, she is one of the youngest battle armor masters in Heavenly Spirit City, with a bright future ahead of her.
The Transmission Tower has already promised to assist her in providing a wealth of resources in the future to help her strive for the two-word battle armor master title. Once she becomes a two-word battle armor master, she will truly be recognized as a battle armor master, holding a significant position across the entire continent.
But who would have thought that as soon as she joyfully exited the Transmission Tower, she would be ambushed by this group of relatively young brats?
Moreover, their abilities are quite formidable; if they hadn't used their battle armor, they would have truly fallen into a trap just now.
She had no idea that Tang Wulin and the others meant no harm. The Star God's Sword and the Light Dragon Dagger made her feel the threat of death.
At that moment, Wu Changkong's voice rang in the ears of Tang Wulin and his five companions, "As long as you defeat her, this city will be considered your pass."
Tang Wulin's mouth twitched slightly, "Teacher Wu, you have a cunning side to you too!"
This is a complete one-word battle armor master, equivalent to a seven-ring Soul Sage level powerhouse. Can we really win against her?
Before he could think much, Yan Feng had already made her move. A powerful surge of soul power instantly rose, and with a flick of her right hand towards Tang Wulin, the Fire Gourd above her head immediately spewed forth a jet of flames that reached Tang Wulin in an instant.
At this point, there’s no choice but to give it a shot; explanations would undoubtedly be useless. Just by looking at her expression, it's clear that she has already been provoked.
They are in the wrong here! Let's deal with it first.
Tang Wulin took a deep breath, and the three purple soul rings on his body suddenly vanished, replaced by a golden halo that blossomed forth. His right arm swelled, golden dragon scales spreading across it, while at the same time, brilliant star lines rapidly coalesced in his right hand, causing the battle armor gauntlet to materialize.
How could he not go all out against a true battle armor master?
"Battle armor?"
Yan Feng was also taken aback when she saw the battle armor on Tang Wulin's right hand. The words "impossible" instantly flashed through her mind!
How old is he?
Moreover, she could clearly see that Tang Wulin's battle armor was manifesting directly from within his body. Could it be that he possesses a two-word battle armor?
Although it is just a piece of battle armor, possessing one at such a young age is simply unimaginable.
When she first acquired her first piece of battle armor, she was already twenty-one years old, and she was still considered a genius at that time.
After years of hard training, she has finally become a true one-word battle armor master.
But how old are these little brats in front of me?
As Tang Wulin made his move, the others quickly sprang into action as well.
Xu Lizhi had already retreated far back, and without needing to say much, one bun after another shot out from his hands—light and agile soup dumplings, and bloodthirsty red bean buns, one for each person.
Tang Wulin had his left hand behind his back, already receiving two buns, and without hesitation, he stuffed them both into his mouth.
It must be a quick battle to the finish.
Even if it is just a one-word battle armor, once the complete set is gathered, it has the ability to help soul masters quickly restore their soul power.
In a prolonged battle against her, they wouldn't stand a chance.
With a powerful stomp of his left foot against the ground, a thunderous boom erupted, and Tang Wulin shot up like a copper arrow, his right arm raised defensively in front of him. The bloodline within him surged, unleashing the overwhelming aura of the Golden Dragon King. His eyes transformed completely into a golden hue, and the pulsating waves of vitality emanating from his body were filled with an intense ferocity.
With his right hand's Golden Dragon Claw held defensively in front of him, he braced himself against the opponent's flames, pushing forward with determination.
As the captain and a powerful assault-type soul master, he absolutely cannot take a step back now; only by holding the front line can his teammates have a chance.
Under the stimulation of the Bloodthirsty Bean Paste Bun, his soul power and vitality erupted to their peak in an instant, with faint golden scales emerging all over his skin, particularly dazzling on his right hand, right arm, and right chest.
Is he a twin martial soul?
Yan Feng was taken aback.
"Hmph!"
She didn't evade at all; the Fire Gourd above her head suddenly began to spin, transforming the original line of fire into a massive jet of flames that swept over Tang Wulin's head, enveloping his companions and blocking the others.
She aimed to isolate Tang Wulin, first dealing with this little guy who was clearly the opponent's leader.
The Golden Dragon Claw shot forward like lightning, and Yan Feng raised her right hand, forming a fist to meet it head-on.
As the two sides were about to collide, the roar of the dragon within Tang Wulin suddenly intensified, and a massive golden dragon head, over two feet in diameter, appeared without warning, directly devouring Yan Feng's right arm.
The Golden Dragon Shocks the Heavens!
After consuming the Red Jade Shrimp that day, although Tang Wulin's vitality did not manage to break through the fourth seal of the Golden Dragon King, he still experienced a significant improvement, allowing him to gain greater mastery over the Golden Dragon's might.
Yan Feng was also taken aback; she felt a tremendous force coming straight at her, and immediately after, her punch, which had been engulfed in flames, seemed to be devoured as the Golden Dragon Claw, resembling a massive pincer, seized her right hand.
The Golden Dragon Claw exerted its power, and Yan Feng's one-word battle armor shone brightly, with all the fiery patterns seemingly coming to life. Notably, the fire phoenix at her chest truly moved, transforming into a fiery silhouette of a phoenix that charged directly at Tang Wulin's chest.
