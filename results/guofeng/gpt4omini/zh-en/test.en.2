Chapter 1303: As Long as You (1)
"What are you doing?!"
The old master of the Eastern Palace tapped his cane, his voice filled with anger.
"We will have our ancestors arriving soon, so please ask the old master of the Eastern Palace to remain calm; you will find out what we are going to do shortly," the leading man replied.
The old master of the Eastern Palace naturally knew who the 'ancestors' he referred to were.
He was a bit at a loss, not knowing why Pei Yi had come.
Having a grudge against DK is truly not a good thing. Although everyone in R Country wants to drive DK out, it is simply impossible to achieve.
It is just a pipe dream.
A few minutes later, Pei Yi's car arrived.
He got out of the car and shifted his gaze to the car not far away.
An Xiaoning saw him but did not take off her mask and wig, and she also got out of the car.
Wu Lianzhi followed closely behind.
"You’re here." An Xiaoning spoke.
Pei Yi looked her up and down, rarely breaking into a smile. He walked up to her, leaned in a bit closer, and said in a lowered voice, "Oh, this group of people looking at your outfit probably can’t guess it’s you, right?"
"Of course, I just don't want them to know my identity, which is why I asked you to come; it's not the right time yet."
Pei Yi instinctively glanced at Wu Lianzhi and asked, "How come you're with him?"
"There’s something I need to attend to."
He straightened up, turned around, and with a faint smile on his face, said to the people of the Eastern Palace, "I wonder what my sister did to provoke your Eastern Palace family that you would want to kill her?"
"Have you grown so bold that it reaches the top of your head?"
Upon hearing this, the faces of the people from the Eastern Palace family changed instantly. Pei Yi's sister?
Where did Pei Yi get a sister?
The old matriarch of the Eastern Palace spoke up, "Mr. Pei's sister... we truly know nothing about her at all."
"I don't know if it's good to say, but now I will tell you."
Pei Yi said coldly, "Did you hear that clearly?"
"Since Mr. Pei says this is your cousin, then please take your cousin away. As for Donggong Lianzhi, his name is still on my family's genealogy; he has not yet been disowned by our family, and he remains a member of the Eastern Palace family. How we choose to deal with him is a matter for our Eastern Palace family."
Pei Yi hadn't answered yet when An Xiaoning seized the opportunity to call out to him, "Brother, he's my boyfriend, and I'm carrying his child now; you can't just abandon him!"
Pei Yi initially intended to take her away by herself, but unexpectedly, the situation has become a bit tricky now.
However, being overbearing and domineering is just his style; as long as he wants to do something, this little matter is hardly a concern.
"Old lady, you heard that too; this man… can be considered my brother-in-law now. They already have children together, so handing him over to you would mean those kids would grow up without a father, wouldn't it?"
"Do you really think I would agree?"
The old matriarch of the Eastern Palace knew very well that if they allowed Pei Yi to take the person away, they would no longer be able to deal with their grandson openly and honestly. Therefore, despite some apprehension towards DK's influence, they could not afford to show any weakness in their attitude.
"Mr. Pei, I'm afraid that won't be possible. Our family has its own rules regarding the handling of our own people, and outsiders are not permitted to interfere."
"They all say he is the father of my sister's child; have you gotten so old that your hearing is failing you?"
Pei Yi turned his gaze towards Wu Lianzhi and asked, "You tell me, are you a member of the Eastern Palace family?"
"This morning, when my mother served me poisoned food, I had already severed my mother-daughter relationship with her on the spot. Previously, when the people of the Eastern Palace attempted to orchestrate an accidental death for me, Miss An, and her subordinate, I had made my stance very clear. Although the name Donggong Lianzhi still appears in the genealogy and the household register of the Eastern Palace family, I no longer bear the surname Donggong. I now go by Wu; Wu Lianzhi is my current name, and I am no longer a member of the Eastern Palace family!"
Every word was powerful and resonant, each sentence carried a chilling undertone.
Making such a statement in front of so many people clearly demonstrated his determination.
"This is not up to you to decide!" the old lady of the Eastern Palace said. "Once you enter our Eastern Palace, you are a member of our family in life and a ghost of our family in death!"
"Then, old madam of the Eastern Palace, I would like to ask you, now that Miss An is aware of your plot to murder her, are you not concerned that S Country might raise a formal protest while you are here contemplating how to punish and deal with me?"
These words came from Wu Lianzhi's mouth, spoken with an unfamiliar tone and devoid of fear.
"I have dealt with An Xiaoning before," Pei Yi said with a slight smile. "She is the type who repays grudges; if you want her life, do you think she would let it go so easily?"
"Alright, enough of the nonsense. My time is quite valuable, and I'm taking both of them with me."
Seeing that the members of the Eastern Palace family were about to speak again, he added, "If you don't want to see bloodshed here."
In this way, the members of the Eastern Palace family watched as the cooked duck completely flew away.
The old matriarch and the old master of the Eastern Palace were truly infuriated.
Finally, the old matriarch of the Eastern Palace directly declared, "Enough, enough, remove his name from the family registry and have his household registration destroyed!"
"We need to return to S Country."
Pei Yi shot her a sideways glance, "So you plan to withdraw once you've made use of them?"
"Aren't you supposed to agree to one of my requests? I haven't even mentioned it yet, and you're already talking about going back home?"
"I am in a hurry to return to my country for something, but it is also true that I promised to grant you a request. So, go ahead, what is your request?"
"Well, my request might put you in a bit of a difficult position..."
"Then let's not mention it; just say something that won't put me in a difficult position."
Pei Yi turned to her, his gaze fixed intently, "You really haven't changed at all; stay with me for half a month."
"What do you mean by 'stay'?"
"Just like before."
An Xiaoning looked at him and said, "No, first, you can't put me on a leash or restrict my freedom; second, half a month is too long—two days is fine."
"……" Pei Yi's smile slightly faded, "You're being too excessive with your bargaining. Five days, no less. You said you'd let others make requests; now that someone has, you can't go back on your word. I will definitely ensure you have your freedom."
"Then can you let me return to my home country first?"
"No."
Wu Lianzhi, who was in the car, listened to the conversation between the two and truly felt that they might be involved with each other.
Could it be that these two have an ambiguous relationship?
It all sounds like it.
But if that were the case, then the two of them were being far too indiscreet in front of him.
"Then can he return to S Country first? I’ll stay with you alone, is that okay?"
"I won't do anything to you, let's be together." His words were beyond doubt.
An Xiaoning said nothing more.
"Since it wasn't far from Qingping Mountain, they arrived quickly."
Returning to this place truly brings a mix of emotions.
The moment Qin Guo saw her, she felt quite unhappy; as soon as they entered, she immediately rolled her eyes.
Thinking to herself about how her ancestors had brought this plague back again.
