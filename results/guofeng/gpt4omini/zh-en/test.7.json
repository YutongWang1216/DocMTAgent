Curly, the dog, enjoys a day at the beach, swimming and playing in the sand, but is reluctant to leave, gazing longingly out of the car window. Nanfeng reassures Curly that next time, he can move in and enjoy the beach daily, imagining a happy life filled with fun and seafood. Returning to the graduate student dormitory in a cheerful mood, Curly is greeted by Fang Zhao, who confirms his great time at the beach and presents him with a study device containing a new folder of twenty e-books on marine environmental protection and management, along with corresponding test sets. Fang Zhao encourages Curly to read all the books and score full marks on the tests within fifteen days before they move, implying that completing this task will allow Curly to play in the sea. Fang Zhao expresses concern about Curly's potential impact on the local marine ecosystem once they move, worrying he might eat endangered species, as he is unsure of Curly's appetite. While Curly has snuck food during the \"Star Recording\" program, he hasn't overindulged due to Fang Zhao's supervision. Nanfeng visits Fang Zhao to discuss the new house's renovation and notices Curly looking sad. They also talk about online discussions regarding Fang Zhao, who is focused on writing his thesis and has set his communication device to Do Not Disturb, as well as Wei Er's art exhibition featuring a piece titled \"The Dog Next Door,\" which received an A+ grade.",

Meanwhile, Curly, the dog, enjoys a beach day but is reluctant to leave, gazing longingly out of the car window. Nanfeng reassures Curly that he will be able to enjoy the beach daily once they move in, envisioning a happy life filled with fun and seafood. Upon returning to the graduate student dormitory, Curly is greeted by Fang Zhao, who confirms his enjoyable day at the beach and presents Curly with a study device containing a new folder of twenty e-books on marine environmental protection and management, along with test sets. Fang Zhao encourages Curly to complete the readings and achieve full marks on the tests within fifteen days, implying that this will allow him more beach time. He expresses concern about Curly's potential impact on the local marine ecosystem, worrying he might eat endangered species, though Curly has not overindulged due to Fang Zhao's supervision. Nanfeng later visits Fang Zhao to discuss renovations for the new house and notices Curly looking sad. They also discuss online discussions regarding Fang Zhao, who is focused on his thesis and has set his communication device to Do Not Disturb. Additionally, they talk about Wei Er's recent art exhibition, which has sparked significant online debate, especially regarding his piece titled \"The Dog Next Door.\" This painting, more abstract and difficult to interpret than his previous work, has drawn mixed reactions due to its vibrant yet mysterious colors, prompting discussions about Wei Er's unconventional artistic expression and the unsettling nature of his portrayal of Fang Zhao's dog.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 449, Nanfeng decides to purchase a house after a successful inspection, entrusting the details to the real estate agent and the original homeowner. Curly, the dog, enjoys a beach day but is reluctant to leave, gazing longingly out of the car window. Nanfeng reassures Curly that he will be able to enjoy the beach daily once they move in, envisioning a happy life filled with fun and seafood. Upon returning to the graduate student dormitory, Curly is greeted by Fang Zhao, who confirms his enjoyable day at the beach and presents him with a study device containing twenty e-books on marine environmental protection and management, along with test sets. Fang Zhao encourages Curly to complete the readings and achieve full marks on the tests within fifteen days, implying this will allow him more beach time. He expresses concern about Curly's potential impact on the local marine ecosystem, worried he might eat endangered species, though Curly has not overindulged due to Fang Zhao's supervision. Nanfeng later visits Fang Zhao to discuss renovations for the new house and notices Curly looking sad. They also discuss online discussions regarding Fang Zhao, who is focused on his thesis and has set his communication device to Do Not Disturb. Additionally, they talk about Wei Er's recent art exhibition, which has sparked significant online debate, especially regarding his piece titled \"The Dog Next Door.\" This painting, more abstract and difficult to interpret than his previous work, has drawn mixed reactions due to its vibrant yet mysterious colors, prompting discussions about Wei Er's unconventional artistic expression and the unsettling nature of his portrayal of Fang Zhao's dog. The painting has garnered attention and was purchased at a high price by a collector from Muzhou, who views the investment as not just in the art but in Wei Er himself. This enthusiasm has sparked debates about the collector's motivations and the peculiar obsession of the people of Muzhou with dogs. An interview with the collector suggests the painting's value will rise significantly in the future, and it has trended on social media, prompting Fang Zhao to advise Curly to stay indoors for a while due to the attention.",
