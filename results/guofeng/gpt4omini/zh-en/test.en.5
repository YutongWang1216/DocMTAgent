Chapter 369: Out of Danger
The situation was one-sided, with both sides firing at full force, and the entire sky over the ocean was filled with smoke.
The high-speed magnetic wave scanner in Bai Ye's hand fired once more, and another plane was shattered by his shots. This weapon was truly effective, and he was becoming increasingly addicted to using it. The Little Milk Bag commanded with ease, and the air force of the First Terrorist Organization formed an unbreakable offensive and defensive team, beginning their final round of fierce attacks.
Nikola, seeing that the situation was unfavorable, disregarded rank and spoke up loudly, "Master, let's retreat. If we continue fighting like this, we will be completely annihilated."
Louis's fists were clenched tightly, his face darkened, and a strong sense of hostility radiated from him; he was well aware of the current situation.
But he was very unwilling to be driven back like this; they were so close, and he could have captured them again. It was truly frustrating to have it all end in failure.
The man's emerald green eyes flashed with killing intent before retreating back into their quiet melancholy; he nodded at Nikola, who immediately ordered a cover for the retreat.
Louis fixed his gaze on the two of them drifting above the surface of the sea, snorted coldly; this time, they were lucky, but he would not let it end like this.
"Baby, they're retreating. Should we pursue?" Bai Ye chuckled lightly, holding the electromagnetic scanning gun as if it were a child, the corners of his lips curling into a faint yet dangerous smile.
The Little Milk Bag also smiled elegantly, ordering a halt to the attack. In the depths of her dark eyes lay a tranquil calm as she slowly said, "Letting him die without pursuit would be too much of a pity; the game of cat and mouse has only just begun."
This game has already turned the tide.
Louis, he absolutely should not have provoked him; for Nono's death, he must find someone to accompany her to the grave, otherwise he cannot swallow this anger.
When the game starts is up to Louis, but…
The Little Milk Bag's smile was icy and imposing; when it ends, she calls the shots.
Bai Ye smiled, elegantly flicking his sleeves. "Fine, no pursuit. We have plenty of resources to play with him; perhaps it won't even come to them taking action before Louis has someone eager to deal with it."
The Little Milk Bag watched the direction they were fleeing, a cold smile playing on her lips without a word.
"Chu Li, it's over; no need for support. We will return immediately."
Bai Ye and Chu Li finished their call and ordered their subordinates to turn back to Rome.
The Black Hawk and the others exerted tremendous effort to drag Ye San Shao and Cheng Anya up; they all knew that Cheng Anya was infected with a virus and had already taken protective measures. Ye San Shao also warned them that he was infected as well, so the Black Hawk and the others were even more cautious.
Ye San Shao lay there, panting heavily, and couldn't help but kick Miss Cheng, saying, "Xiao Anya, you really need to lose some weight; you're as heavy as a ton."
His entire shoulder felt a bit numb because he had been swimming in the sea for a long time, exhausting a considerable amount of energy, and now, hanging onto Cheng Anya like this was really straining his arms.
He almost lost his grip and dropped her into the sea; just thinking back to that moment still sent a chill down his spine.
The Black Hawk and the others cheered for their safety, with some handing out towels and others pouring hot water, all busily engaged in their tasks. A few even took the opportunity to tease Ye San Shao about how he had been faring lately.
The atmosphere on the plane was lively, with the men together, exuding a sense of camaraderie.
Cheng Anya wiped her hair with the towel handed to her by the Black Hawk, wrapping herself in a blanket to keep warm. Her ears automatically tuned out his words; finally safe, she sneezed and couldn't help but wrap herself a little tighter.
The Black Hawk chuckled and said, "San Shao, if the lady were any thinner, you'd complain she's nothing but bones."
"I’m complaining about it right now."
Ye San Shao also got up, drying off the seawater from his body, "It's precisely because she's nothing but bones that she's so heavy."
Cheng Anya continued to uphold the virtue of silence, while the Black Hawk found two sets of clothes for them to change into. Since they were men's clothes, they looked quite ridiculous on Miss Cheng, so she simply wrapped herself in a blanket.
Just after changing her clothes, the Black Hawk informed her that Ning Ning wanted to speak with her.
Cheng Anya excitedly snatched the microphone, "Baby, it's Mommy!"
"Hi, Mommy, have you missed your baby?"
The Little Milk Bag sat on the sofa, chatting with Cheng Anya with a beaming smile, having missed hearing her Mommy's voice for a long time.
"I don't want to at all."
Cheng Anya snorted coldly, her tone fierce, "You're so useless; it took you this long to find Mommy. You deserve a beating."
Ning Ning thought of the promise, her heart sinking for a moment, but then she smiled, "Alright, baby can call whenever. Once we return to Rome, you can call as much as you want. I really miss Mommy; you don't care about me at all, I look down on you."
"Counter-disdain."
Cheng Anya laughed heartily, then asked with concern, "You didn't get hurt, did you?"
"No, I'm doing well, not a scratch on me, so don't worry." Ning Ning smiled and said, "Mommy, the plane is about to land, I'll talk to you soon."
"Okay."
The Little Milk Bag turned off the communicator, while Cheng Anya sipped hot water to warm herself. Ye San Shao, who had been eagerly hoping to chat with his son for a moment, ended up getting cut off without any conversation, leaving him very dissatisfied as he cast a reproachful glance at Cheng Anya.
Miss Cheng calmly ignored him, while the Black Hawk laughed and said, "San Shao, the plane is about to land, and you'll be able to see the young master soon."
Ye San Shao felt completely ignored and couldn't help but pinch Miss Cheng, saying, "Heartless little thing."
"Cheapskate."
Cheng Anya playfully scolded him and handed him the hot water. Ye San Shao clinked his cup against Miss Cheng's and drank the remaining hot water, thinking that it would be even better if he had a bit of alcohol to warm him up.
The plane soon landed, touching down at the castle, where Chu Li, Ye Wei, and Eleven were present. Upon seeing that Ye San Shao and Cheng Anya were safe, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.
"Third Brother, Third Sister-in-law, you both look quite disheveled..."
Ye Wei laughed joyfully, "Third Brother, I should have recorded this as a keepsake."
"Stinky girl."
Ye San Shao chuckled and scolded lightly, feeling relieved that Wei Wei, Eleven, and the Little Milk Bag were all safe.
After going to such great lengths, how could anything go wrong again?
The Little Milk Bag joyfully wanted to hug Cheng Anya, but she sternly ordered him to stop. It then dawned on him that his Mommy was carrying a virus, as Black Hawk had already mentioned. He looked at the hands of his Daddy and Mommy clasped together, feeling a slight heaviness in his heart.
"Daddy, Mommy, you both... Bai Ye, please help them take a look."
The Little Milk Bag's first reaction was to look for Bai Ye; he was a genius doctor who could cure any illness.
"Got it, got it, don't worry."
Bai Ye smiled.
"Virus?"
A handsome guy with blonde hair and blue eyes blinked and said, "Little Bai, isn't this your forte?"
"Little Bai?"
Bai Ye twisted his wrist, smiling elegantly and gently, "Jason, why don't you try calling Little Bai again?"
"…Damn it, what's wrong with me calling you Little Bai? You are Little Bai, yet you still call Blackjack Little Iron."
Jason, known as the Fire Dragon, breathed fire on the spot, resembling the golden-haired lion king, yet still strikingly handsome enough to evoke both admiration and envy.
Especially those sky-blue eyes, dazzling like sapphires.
When enraged, there is a chilling aura, akin to a volcanic eruption, exuding an overt dominance.
Beside him, Blackjack was a young man in his twenties, strikingly handsome with a delicate appearance. He was of Chinese-British mixed heritage, possessing the mysterious features of an Easterner combined with the depth of a Westerner. His gray-blue eyes always had a misty look, giving off an impression of deep affection, but upon closer inspection, one would find him to be exceptionally perceptive, with a reserved demeanor that concealed much.
The two leaders of the First Terrorist Organization, though young and distinctly different in personality, exude a formidable presence, each embodying a regal aura as if they were sovereigns ruling over the world, not to mention the three major figures gathered here.
The row ahead presents a striking visual impact.
"Jason, you really need a good fixing."
Eleven huffed, "Why call him anything else? Little Bai, Little Bai, punch him."
Ye Wei glanced at them and shook her head. "Third Brother, Third Sister-in-law, don't pay any attention to them. You should take a hot bath first and check later to avoid getting sick."
She summoned a maid to take Ye Chen and Cheng Anya downstairs to wash up. Although the Little Milk Bag really wanted to follow, he stayed here instead, as Bai Ye pretended to get ready to hit someone, prompting the Little Milk Bag to quickly tug at his sleeve.
"Bai Ye, do you have a way to save my Daddy and Mommy?"
The child's eyes were bright, like two black grapes set against a fair complexion, filled with anticipation, as if the light in Bai Ye's gaze would dim the moment he shook his head.
Jason picked up the Little Milk Bag and held him in his arms, brimming with confidence. "Don't worry, sweetheart, Little Bai can save even the dead, let alone living people. There's no need to fret; come over when you have time and help me blow up the Mafia's defenses."
"Who just questioned Bai Ye's medical skills?"
Blackjack expressed his confusion about this, but Jason swiftly reached out with his palm, and he nimbly dodged aside.
The Little Milk Bag was held tightly by the tall figure, feeling quite conflicted, and kicked at Jason, "Put me down."
"I also want a son like that. Ning Ning, how about you become my son? I've been coveting you for a long time." Jason's azure eyes sparkled with intense excitement, as if the Little Milk Bag were just a piece of succulent meat.
Everyone, "..."
Bai Ye smiled and said, "Jason, let your mom teach you some more Chinese. Don't keep saying the commander doesn't know the words; you're not doing any better."
"I'm not on the same level as the commander, okay?"
Jason was quite dissatisfied with being associated with the commander; as the saying goes, "Officials and bandits are not of the same family," and this is a matter of principle.
The Little Milk Bag struggled for a moment, and Jason let him down. The Little Milk Bag asked, "Bai Ye..."
"Ning Ning, I can’t be sure until I’ve examined them, so don’t worry just yet," Bai Ye said, ruffling the Little Milk Bag's hair. "I promise I will do my best."
The Little Milk Bag had just lost his promise, and with the uncertainty surrounding his parents' lives, no matter how calm he appeared, he felt uneasy. He couldn't afford to lose them again, and Bai Ye understood his state of mind perfectly.
"Don't worry too much," Bai Ye said.
Ye Wei said, "It's settled, leave it to Bai Ye. There's no problem in this world that can't be solved. Since Louis was able to develop the virus, there must be an antidote; it can't be unsolvable. If Bai Ye can't figure it out, then take down his sign."
Chu Li smiled, "Agreed."
"Little Bai, do you have a sign?"
Jason expressed deep confusion; he had always been unaware of what sign he possessed.
Eleven really wanted to punch him.
"Speaking of which, why didn't you two catch Louis on the way back?"
Blackjack asked, "If this guy were dead, we would feel more at ease."
"I've wanted to eliminate him for a long time. The Mafia has been provoking us all over the place lately, and this guy's headquarters has been bombed yet he still has the mood to play the love game; it's truly foolish."
"Louis is not in a hurry," the Little Milk Bag said slowly, a hint of danger curling at the corners of his mouth, his pitch-black eyes gleaming with calculation. "Winning without fighting is the highest level of victory. His personal vendetta against us is one thing, but the struggle between the Mafia and the terrorist organization is another matter altogether."
"We will certainly need to expend a significant amount of financial and material resources to eliminate the Mafia."
"After this incident, his position in the Mafia is precarious. I've always suspected that there is still a force hidden from our sight within the Mafia; otherwise, they would have certainly stopped Louis from taking such self-destructive actions. Since that’s the case, let’s have Louis lead us to uncover this force and eliminate it in one fell swoop."
Cunning...
This is the consensus among everyone.
Although they knew he was typically very cunning and devious, his young age often led everyone to indulge him, and coupled with his soft and delicate appearance, it made it easy for people to overlook his true nature.
"Cunning!"
Jason gave a thumbs up; he was always a man of action, not one to overthink like the others. However, most of the time, he would listen to Blackjack and Chu Li's plans.
The Little Milk Bag's plan is one he consistently follows without question.
Behind a true man of action is a powerful think tank, and this force is truly terrifying.
"Ning Ning's approach is something I agree with," Chu Li said, as he and Bai Ye have always shared the same thoughts, "It's a one-time solution to prevent anyone from underestimating the situation and constantly provoking us."
"When have you ever contradicted Ning Ning? You're colluding together."
"Blackjack chuckled, 'However, this time, we really should teach the Mafia a lesson, so that for the next fifty years, they'll have to take a detour whenever they see us.'"
Bai Ye nodded, having no objections. His primary concern was to find a solution for the virus affecting Ye San Shao and Cheng Anya; that was the priority. The rest, he would leave to Chu Li.
Ye Wei and Eleven exchanged glances. Another force, perhaps?
A familiar face emerged in their minds, could it be Mo Ye and Mo Jue?
"In the Mafia, only they possess sufficient charisma and an enigmatic presence; apart from them, they couldn't think of anyone else with such boldness. It should be a man who stands above Louis, and it makes no sense for him to take orders from him."
Everyone moved to the living room, and the Little Milk Bag went to find Cheng Anya, who had just finished her bath and was sipping a cup of hot tea. Her body felt warm, and her cheeks were tinged with a rosy hue as she sat on the bed, contemplatively gazing at her fingers.
"Mommy..."
The Little Milk Bag pushed the door open and walked in with a cheerful smile.
Cheng Anya came back to her senses, squinting her eyes and praising, "Darling, you really have style."
This outfit is truly impressive; there's not a hint of childishness about it—he's entirely a figure of danger.
"Thank you, Mommy, for the compliment."
"Don't come any closer, sit farther away; I'm afraid I might not be able to help but hit you."
"Sit over there," Cheng Anya pointed to the sofa across from her.
The Little Milk Bag shot Cheng Anya a resentful glance and said, "Mommy, you don't like me anymore."
"That's correct."
Cheng Anya smiled and glanced at the Little Milk Bag; she always felt that something about him was different. Although he looked the same as before, a mother knows her child best, and no matter how well he tried to hide it, she could sense that there was a change in him.
"Mommy, why are you looking at me like that? Do you think the baby has become handsome?"
The Little Milk Bag mischievously blinked his eyes, looking extremely cute.
Cheng Anya looked at him with a half-smile, "You've certainly picked up about eighty to ninety percent of your Daddy's narcissism. Have you been okay lately? Tell Mommy the truth—have you been bullied?"
The Little Milk Bag shook his head, "No."
"Nonsense, Louis showed me the photos; he was clearly covered in blood."
Cheng Anya clearly did not believe him, gritting her teeth, "He could be sliced into a thousand pieces, and I still wouldn't feel satisfied."
Recalling everything she had once endured, Cheng Anya felt an intense hatred for Louis.
A bright face, shrouded in a layer of coldness; thinking of the past that the Little Milk Bag had endured, she felt an even stronger sense of foreboding.
"Mommy, I'm really fine; it's mostly his doing."
The Little Milk Bag smiled gracefully, rolled up his sleeves, revealing a section of his fair, tender arm. "Look, not a single scar."
The wounds on his arm had mostly healed, and soon he was no longer afraid of being discovered by Cheng Anya.
The whip marks he once bore were all left by Xu Nuo; since they were inflicted by Xu Nuo, he didn't feel bullied at all; instead, he even somewhat missed the pain of being beaten by her back then.
If Nono could live, he would gladly be beaten by her for the rest of his life.
"Ning Ning, are you really okay?"
Cheng Anya's brows furrowed, not missing the fleeting pain that flashed in her son's eyes.
The Little Milk Bag nodded, "I'm really fine, Mommy. It's you and Daddy who are in trouble. Uncle Black Hawk said you have a virus; how did Daddy get infected too?"
Cheng Anya recalled Ye San Shao, who was consumed by his desires, and her cheeks flushed again. She could barely muster the words of longing, "Let's not talk about it. We jumped out of a plane in the desert and then again at sea; how could we possibly avoid contact?"
Miss Cheng spoke calmly, and the Little Milk Bag had no doubts about it.
"Mommy, you won't be in trouble. Bai Ye's medical skills are so exceptional; he will definitely find a way to save you."
