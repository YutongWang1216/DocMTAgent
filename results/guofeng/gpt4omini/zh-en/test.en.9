Chapter 70: Lord of the East Cave (Part Eight)
This was exactly what Song Fu and the others wanted to ask, but someone beat them to it. They exchanged glances, both at a loss for words, unsure how to respond.
Miao Yi immediately soared toward the source of the loud noise, and Yan Xiu and the others quickly followed.
Song Fu and the others exchanged glances and followed suit to see what was going on.
As everyone arrived at the entrance of the mountain gate, they were taken aback to see that the stone archway inscribed with the three characters 'East Cave' had shattered into pieces under the moonlight, revealing that someone had actually destroyed the mountain gate of the East Cave.
Miao Yi suddenly turned around, his face twisted in a grimace as he looked at Song Fu and the others, sneering repeatedly, "Good!"
"I just arrived today, and it seems someone can’t wait to give me a taste of their intimidation!"
"Very good!"
Song Fu and the others were taken aback; they understood the implication of the other party's words, but they definitely hadn’t done it, as they had just been gathered together for a small get-together, discussing how to give Miao Yi a hard time, and they only ran out upon hearing the unusual noise.
A few of them initially suspected whether it was Miao Yi and his group who had done it, but seeing Miao Yi like this, they felt that there was no need for him to destroy his own mountain gate to make a statement. After all, Miao Yi was the master of the East Cave, and having his signboard smashed right after taking office would be quite embarrassing.
"This kind of matter must be clarified; otherwise, if it escalates, we won't be able to bear the responsibility." Song Fu said solemnly, clasping his fists. "Master, this incident was definitely not caused by us!"
The other few also clasped their fists in assurance, seemingly treating Miao Yi as the master for the first time in a serious manner.
"Shameless excuses!"
Miao Yi stared at Song Fu and said sternly, "I only assigned you to guard the mountain gate today. How could you not know if someone destroyed it?"
"Could it be that you intentionally let it slide?"
"This..."
Song Fu was at a loss for words; he hadn’t even been here, and it wouldn’t be appropriate to say that he didn’t regard the master at all, so he could only clasp his fists and 'honestly' explain, "The master may not be aware of the situation since you just arrived. The miscellaneous workers from Donglai City have not been dispatched yet, and we have been handling our own food and drink. In order to fill our stomachs, my subordinates temporarily stepped away, and I didn’t expect such an incident to occur."
Wang Zifa and the others also successively clasped their fists to affirm, "Master, we can testify that Brother Song Fu was just having a meal with us."
Miao Yi pointed at the fallen archway and said sternly, "Is this something that just fell down by itself? Please don't tell me it was blown down by the wind!"
Song Fu felt a bit like a mute eating bitter gall, and he had no choice but to raise his hand and say, "Master, I can swear on the honor of my ancestors from the Lan Yu Sect that this was absolutely not our doing. If I speak even half a lie, may I, Song Fu, meet a terrible end!"
Miao Yi's gaze flickered uncertainly over the crowd as he spoke in a dark tone, "Is it possible that someone has come to stir up trouble in my East Cave?"
Everyone was taken aback, realizing that there might indeed be such a possibility, and they quickly looked around.
"What are you still doing here? Do you want to be caught off guard and have your throats slit in your sleep?"
"Why aren't you dispersing to search right away?"
Miao Yi said angrily.
Yan Xiu and the other two cupped their fists in response and quickly dispersed into the surrounding mountains and forests.
"Uh?"
Miao Yi snorted heavily through his nose, glaring at Song Fu and the others, seemingly questioning why, if it wasn't them, they weren't investigating—did they know something?
At this moment, everyone needed to declare their stance to prove their innocence, and Song Fu immediately turned around, shouting, "Why aren't you obeying the master's orders to investigate?"
The crowd cupped their fists towards Miao Yi and immediately dispersed.
However, Song Fu was stopped by Miao Yi, who said, "Song Fu, come with me!"
Song Fu was taken aback for a moment, cupped his fists in acknowledgment, and followed behind Miao Yi.
Just as everyone left, a shadow resembling a figure in water appeared in the same spot; it was none other than the unparalleled presence of Old Bai.
Old Bai stared at the fallen stone archway, shaking his head slightly with a faint smile as he said, "Life is like a game of chess; how can a hot-blooded man rely solely on brute strength?"
"I have always worried that you, this lad, are too kind-hearted and might suffer losses... A man must have skills to thrive; mere brutes cannot ascend to greatness. Now, I find myself much more at ease."
As the words fell, the entire figure wavered like ripples in water, quietly vanishing without a trace.
In the grand hall of the East Cave, the flickering candlelight cast shadows as Song Fu stood behind Miao Yi, positioning himself within the hall. Outside, the black charcoal had risen to its feet, seemingly sensing something, and let out a loud sneeze.
Miao Yi stared expressionlessly at his throne, with his hands clasped behind his back, turning away from Song Fu and remaining silent.
The atmosphere between the two was somewhat oppressive. After waiting for a moment, Song Fu could no longer hold back and asked, "What does the master want with me?"
Miao Yi spoke in a grim tone, "Song Fu, do you know your crime?"
Song Fu curled his lips in a smirk, glancing at the food and wine on the low table beside him, and replied nonchalantly, "This matter is absolutely not our doing; what crime does Song Fu have?"
"I'm not asking about that!"
Miao Yi suddenly turned around, fixing his gaze on him, and coldly asked, word by word, "I command you to guard the mountain gate; why did you abandon your post? Do you not regard my orders as the master of this cave?"
Song Fu thought to himself, "What do you think?"
It was never regarded as important.
Of course, I wouldn't say it like that. "Song Fu has already informed the master that it was out of necessity that I temporarily left to satisfy my hunger; I did not wish to see such a thing happen."
Miao Yi asked, "Do you think the lord of the estate and the mountain master will believe your explanation once I report this matter?"
Song Fu chuckled and said, "People have two sides to their mouths; if the master insists on framing me, then so be it. However, the master shouldn't forget that I also have a mouth to defend myself, and I am not mute."
Miao Yi sneered, "It seems you truly are unrepentant!"
As soon as these words were spoken, Yan Xiu, Shan Biao Yi, and Qiu Shao Qun appeared together at the door, stepping inside and cupping their fists towards Miao Yi, saying, "Master, we have not found any suspicious individuals for the time being."
Miao Yi said, "The suspicious individuals are right in front of us; how can you claim that none have been found?"
Shan Biao Yi and Qiu Shao Qun seemed to have received a signal, quickly darting forward to close the hall doors.
Song Fu was startled by the sound and quickly turned around, only to see the fearsome Yan Xiu charging at him with a pair of battle axes raised in anger.
Song Fu quickly drew his side sword, a flash of cold light emerging from the scabbard, and swiftly clashed it against the incoming attack with a series of metallic clangs.
Shan Biao Yi and Qiu Shao Qun almost instantly brandished their spears, joining forces to besiege Song Fu.
Yan Xiu and Song Fu were evenly matched in cultivation, and with Shan Biao Yi and Qiu Shao Qun joining forces, Song Fu's situation became precarious in an instant.
"Shameless scoundrel!"
"How dare you conspire to harm...?"
Surrounded and unable to escape, Song Fu, who was desperately holding his ground against Yan Xiu with his sword, had barely finished his sorrowful and furious shout when two spears pierced through his magical defenses and plunged deeply into his chest.
Song Fu widened his eyes and struggled to turn back to Miao Yi, his lips trembling, with an indescribable anger in his gaze.
He finally understood that this was a trap; the collapse of the mountain gate archway was not only meant to frame him, but also to draw his fellow sect members away, preventing him from uniting with them to resist, with the primary objective being to take his life.
