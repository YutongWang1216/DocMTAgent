Chapter 449: The Dog Next Door
After carefully inspecting the house and confirming that there were no major issues, they basically made a decision, and the remaining matters would be handled by Nanfeng with the real estate agent and the original homeowner.
Curly was in a great mood today, going out to frolic and have a wonderful time.
After swimming around in the sea, Curly was called ashore by Fang Zhao and played in the sand for quite a while. When it was time to leave, the dog kept staring longingly out of the car window, filled with reluctance.
Nanfeng smiled and said, "Curly, don't worry. Next time you come, you'll be able to move in right away. You can play as long as you want, swim in the sea every day, and there will be little fish and shrimp to play with!"
Curly was delighted and lay inside the car, starting to imagine a happy life ahead.
What impression does Curly have of the ocean?
The impression of a seafood buffet that doesn't cost anything.
Its cheerful mood continued all the way back to the graduate student dormitory.
After Nanfeng and the others left, Fang Zhao closed the dormitory door and said, "Curly, come here."
Curly wagged its tail and trotted over.
"Did you have fun playing today?"
Fang Zhao asked.
"Bark!"
"Is it fun over there?"
Fang Zhao asked again.
Curly jumped up and barked again, its tail wagging enthusiastically.
"Speak."
"Fun!"
Curly said.
It can now switch languages fluently, pronouncing them clearly and smoothly.
"Yes."
Fang Zhao nodded, then turned on the study device.
Curly: "……"
With a twitch of its ears, Curly shrank back its paw and took a step back, thinking it was being inconspicuous.
Fang Zhao ignored its retreat, opened the study device, and showed it a newly created folder containing the recently purchased e-books—
Marine Environmental Protection Law
Youth Environmental Protection Knowledge Series
Marine Wildlife Protection Directory
Marine Environmental Management
One Hundred Ocean Facts Every New Century Person Must Know
The Sea, Oh My Home
All are books related to the ocean, totaling twenty volumes.
Not only are there e-books, but also accompanying test sets, totaling twenty sets.
Curly: "……"
The excited ears drooped down.
"Knowing that you read quickly, you should be even faster now?"
"Once you finish reading the twenty books in the folder and score full marks on all twenty corresponding test sets, I'll let you go play in the sea."
"There's no more than fifteen days left until the move," Fang Zhao said.
"It's all just rote memorization; with Curly's current memory and learning ability, scoring full marks shouldn't be too difficult."
Curly going to the sea doesn't worry Fang Zhao about his safety; rather, he is concerned that Curly might eat some endangered animals to extinction.
Fang Zhao still isn't sure just how big Curly's stomach really is.
During the "Star Recording" program, Curly has snuck food in the desert and also in the sea, but due to Fang Zhao's warnings, Curly hasn't really opened his stomach to eat.
After all, the time spent at the "Star Recording" program is not long, and with Fang Zhao's supervision and consideration for the other participants, Curly can't sneak away too much food.
However, once they move to the new house, Curly will have the chance to go to the sea every day, and without any restrictions, that would be akin to an invasion of species, as one dog could disrupt the ecological balance of that marine area.
Fang Zhao needs to let Curly understand a few things in advance; marine life has worked hard to recover to its current state, and he must not let Curly destroy it.
"Without scoring full marks, you can only dream of going to the sea; for now, you'll have to keep company with the study device!"
On this day, Nanfeng came to see Fang Zhao regarding the renovation of the new house.
As soon as Nanfeng entered the dormitory, he saw Curly facing the wall, his head drooping sadly as he squatted there, with tear stains under his dog eyes.
Nanfeng paused for a moment, then shifted his gaze away to find Fang Zhao and address the matter at hand.
As for Curly, this is the norm, and Nanfeng has become quite calm about it.
After discussing the renovation matters, Nanfeng recalled something he saw today and said, "By the way, Boss, do you know about what happened online today?"
"What is it?"
"Fang Zhao is writing his thesis today, and with the communication settings adjusted, he won't be disturbed unless there's something important."
During this period, there have been many discussions about him online, and a lot of people are trying to reach him, so Fang Zhao can only set his device to Do Not Disturb mode.
"Do you know about Wei Er's painting?"
Nanfeng asked.
"Yes, is it about Wei Er's graduation project?"
Fang Zhao went to see Wei Er's graduation art exhibition, which received an A+ grade, and one of the pieces featured Curly, titled "The Dog Next Door."
Two days have passed since the art exhibition, and with Fang Zhao having been busy writing his thesis in the dormitory since this morning, he truly has no idea what has been happening online.
Nanfeng shared the information he had gathered with Fang Zhao.
It turns out that after Wei Er's graduation art exhibition concluded, the college displayed his artwork on the school's website, sparking a heated discussion.
Wei Er successfully completed the study plan he set last year—his short-term goal was to paint Fang Zhao, and his ultimate goal was to paint Fang Zhao's dog.
The short-term goal has long been achieved; Wei Er's painting "My Neighbor" initially sparked heated discussions online, with some netizens joking that Wei Er depicted Fang Zhao as an alien.
This time, following "My Neighbor," "The Dog Next Door" once again topped the trending search list that day.
"The Dog Next Door" is the piece that Wei Er spent the most time on during his studies, researched the longest, and put the most effort into, and it is also the work he is most satisfied with.
This painting is similar in style to the previous work "My Neighbor," but it appears to be more difficult to understand; at least in "My Neighbor," one could still recognize a person's likeness, whereas in "The Dog Next Door," it’s hard to discern that it’s a dog at all. If it weren't for the title of the painting, no one would think that what’s depicted is a dog, let alone a small pet dog.
The vibrant colors are rendered with great vitality, mysterious yet imbued with a grand spirit; they seem excessively extraordinary, yet it's hard to pinpoint what's amiss, and the more one studies it, the more a sense of tremor arises from within.
"Is Fang Zhao's dog really that scary?"
A student from the Royal College of Art recalled the little Curly dog they had encountered on campus after seeing this painting, then searched online for Fang Zhao's dog to confirm they weren't mistaken.
On the Royal College of Art side, those who attended Fang Zhao's graduation concert and closely analyzed Wei Er's painting had a different impression.
"If I really had to say, this painting gives me a feeling similar to Fang Zhao's piece 'η'."
"It's a bit beyond the average person's understanding."
Even if an outsider stands in front of this painting and quietly gazes at it for a few seconds, even if they don't understand it, they'll still feel a shiver down their spine, as if something unsettling is stirring within.
Online, the discussions have become even more intense.
"I've noticed that Wei Er has completely let loose after his studies; his thoughts run wild and free, beyond what we can comprehend."
"What kind of grudge is this! How could they paint Fang Zhao's dog like this!"
"That friend up front must not have seen Wei Er's previous piece, 'My Neighbor'; let's take a look at how Wei Er portrayed Fang Zhao."
"Perhaps Wei Er was bitten by a dog and has a psychological scar from it; otherwise, he wouldn't have painted it so frighteningly!"
"What a lovely little cutie turned into a monster!"
"This is called art!"
"The world of artists is indeed beyond the comprehension of us ordinary people."
"I'm not exaggerating or criticizing; I stared at the painting for a full five minutes and still couldn't grasp what he was trying to express, but I can't shake off this inexplicable feeling that it's really impressive, along with a strange sensation inside."
"This type of artwork, which belongs to a deeper level, requires careful study."
"Is this painting hard to sell?"
"It can also be bought back to ward off evil."
"It's still worth investing in; I have high hopes for Wei Er as an artist, as he is still young."
"Actually, after Wei Er's paintings were displayed on the campus website, someone approached him to buy a painting."
The final collector from Muzhou purchased "The Dog Next Door" at a high price, offering far more than the Royal College of Art's estimated value.
Some people believe that this collector from Muzhou is overly enthusiastic about Curly; when facing Curly, the people of Muzhou seem to never be calm enough.
Some people also believe that this is pure hype, not just for Wei Er as a person but for Fang Zhao's dog; the people of Muzhou's attitude towards dogs is indeed perplexing, as if they have lost their minds.
In response, the Huangzhou TV Station's Calligraphy and Painting Channel specifically sent someone to interview the person who purchased the painting at a high price.
During the interview, the collector from Muzhou stated, "Many people buy Wei Er's paintings as an investment in Wei Er himself, rather than in the artwork."
"I see it differently; I'm looking at the painting, and of course, at the dog within it."
"I have a feeling that this painting will skyrocket to an astronomical price in the future."
Seeing the live broadcast of the interview, Xiao Xiong remarked, "The people of Muzhou really have a terrifying intuition when it comes to dogs."
"Humans are indeed peculiar beings."
As a result, Curly also trended on social media due to Wei Er's painting "The Dog Next Door," making headlines in the Huangzhou Current Affairs News.
After Nanfeng left, Fang Zhao browsed the news online and said to Curly, "You should stay indoors for the next few days. Just stand for another five minutes before going back to your studies."
"Scoring only 62 on the morning test, you need to review the section on animal protection a couple more times!"
"Can whales even be eaten?!"
"Coral can't be eaten either!"
