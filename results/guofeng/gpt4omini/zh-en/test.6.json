Tang Wulin and his team confront her, surrounding her with weapons drawn. Unexpectedly, she unleashes a powerful surge of soul power, accompanied by a phoenix cry, which significantly boosts her strength and creates a massive fiery ring that violently repels Tang Wulin and his allies. Tang Wulin realizes that the woman possesses a complete one-word battle armor, indicating her cultivation level has surged from five rings to seven. Yan Feng, recently recognized as a one-word battle armor master, had initially been optimistic about her growth prospects but felt threatened by Tang Wulin and his companions, leading her to attack despite their intentions to cause no harm.

Tang Wulin realizes she possesses a complete one-word battle armor, indicating her cultivation level has surged from five rings to seven. Yan Feng, recently recognized as a one-word battle armor master, feels threatened by Tang Wulin and his companions, leading her to attack despite their intentions to cause no harm. As she launches a fierce flame attack, Tang Wulin prepares to counter with his own battle armor, knowing he must give it his all against this formidable opponent. Yan Feng is astonished by Tang Wulin's battle armor manifesting at such a young age, questioning whether he possesses a two-word battle armor. Reflecting on her own experience of acquiring her first battle armor at twenty-one, she finds his talent extraordinary. As Tang Wulin readies for battle, his teammate Xu Lizhi provides him with buns to restore soul power, indicating a quick confrontation is imminent. Fueled by the power of the Golden Dragon King, Tang Wulin unleashes a powerful aura and transforms, prepared to face the opponent's flames while ensuring his teammates have a chance to succeed.
