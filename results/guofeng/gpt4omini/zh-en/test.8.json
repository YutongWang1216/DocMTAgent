        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 455: Reversal 3, Lin Sheng is guided by a sorcerer leader to explore an evil spirit gate to efficiently obtain soul fragments. Initially focused on battling evil spirits for pure soul power, Lin Sheng sees the sorcerer leader's method of using supernatural powers to create a teleportation spatial base with multiple potential destinations as a more effective approach. This process involves randomness, potentially requiring several attempts to reach their desired spatial secret realm. As Lin Sheng's consciousness enters the Evil Spirit Gate, he experiences a unique state where it splits into over ten parts, allowing him to perceive multiple spatial auras simultaneously. The sorcerer leader teaches him how to create simple markers for spatial coordinates, but is surprised by Lin Sheng's ability to remember all the coordinates due to the resilience of his spirit lock. His advanced multitasking skills, developed through practice, enable him to track and mark the coordinates despite feeling exhausted after ten minutes. Upon opening his eyes, Lin Sheng confidently provides the coordinates for a special spatial secret realm linked to the evil-turning wheel fragment he possesses, achieving this on his first attempt, unlike the sorcerer leader's previous struggles. He instructs them to establish a teleportation gate to that location.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 455: Reversal 3, Lin Sheng, guided by a sorcerer leader, explores an evil spirit gate to efficiently obtain soul fragments. Initially focused on battling evil spirits for pure soul power, he recognizes the effectiveness of the sorcerer leader's method, which utilizes supernatural powers to create a teleportation spatial base with multiple potential destinations. This process involves randomness, often requiring several attempts to reach the desired spatial secret realm. As Lin Sheng's consciousness enters the Evil Spirit Gate, it splits into over ten parts, allowing him to perceive multiple spatial auras simultaneously. The sorcerer leader teaches him to create simple markers for spatial coordinates, but is surprised by Lin Sheng's ability to remember them, thanks to the resilience of his spirit lock. His advanced multitasking skills, developed through practice, enable him to track and mark the coordinates despite exhaustion after ten minutes. Upon opening his eyes, Lin Sheng confidently provides the coordinates for a special spatial secret realm linked to the evil-turning wheel fragment he possesses, achieving this on his first attempt, unlike the sorcerer leader's previous struggles. He instructs them to establish a teleportation gate to that location. Meanwhile, during a soul transmission with Tiangongxia, Lin Sheng experiences hesitation as he learns of a serious situation that contrasts sharply with Shajia Island. Observing the sorcerer leader directing evil spirits to move resources, he voices his concerns about the unusual tension in Tiangongxia's tone, speculating on Mi Yue's potential disadvantage or the emergence of new combat power. Tiangongxia reveals that Mi Yue has deceived everyone in the three great secret realms by summoning Farudo and sacrificing himself to fuse with the entity, leaving Lin Sheng shocked to discover they are now facing a fused monster of Mi Yue and Farudo.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 455: Reversal 3, Lin Sheng, guided by a sorcerer leader, explores an evil spirit gate to efficiently obtain soul fragments. Initially focused on battling evil spirits for pure soul power, he recognizes the effectiveness of the sorcerer leader's method, which utilizes supernatural powers to create a teleportation spatial base with multiple potential destinations. This process involves randomness, often requiring several attempts to reach the desired spatial secret realm. As Lin Sheng's consciousness enters the Evil Spirit Gate, it splits into over ten parts, allowing him to perceive multiple spatial auras simultaneously. The sorcerer leader teaches him to create simple markers for spatial coordinates, but is surprised by Lin Sheng's ability to remember them, thanks to the resilience of his spirit lock. His advanced multitasking skills enable him to track and mark the coordinates despite exhaustion after ten minutes. Upon opening his eyes, Lin Sheng confidently provides the coordinates for a special spatial secret realm linked to the evil-turning wheel fragment he possesses, achieving this on his first attempt, unlike the sorcerer leader's previous struggles. He instructs them to establish a teleportation gate to that location. Meanwhile, during a soul transmission with Tiangongxia, Lin Sheng experiences hesitation as he learns of a serious situation that contrasts sharply with Shajia Island. Tiangongxia expresses concern about the alliance between Farudo and Mi Yue, emphasizing that their combined strength poses a significant threat to their enemies, particularly the three great secret realms and other major powers. Observing the sorcerer leader directing evil spirits to move resources, Lin Sheng voices his concerns about the unusual tension in Tiangongxia's tone, speculating on Mi Yue's potential disadvantage or the emergence of new combat power. Tiangongxia reveals that Mi Yue has deceived everyone in the three great secret realms by summoning Farudo and sacrificing himself to fuse with the entity, shocking Lin Sheng as he realizes they are now facing a fused monster of Mi Yue and Farudo. Recalling previous investigations regarding the Great Star Pool and those wielding Destiny Sacred Artifacts, Lin Sheng acknowledges the complexity of the situation and recognizes the need for early preparation, drawing from Tiangongxia's past experience with destructive power under the influence of the Demon Sword.",
