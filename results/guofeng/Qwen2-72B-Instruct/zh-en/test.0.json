        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter One titled \"A New Journey,\" a scene unfolds in a windswept canyon where a large wooden merchant ship sails through the air, its sails catching the fierce wind. A middle-aged man in leather armor admires the vast grassland below, noting the impressive wind phenomenon. He stands next to a rotund merchant with curly hair, dressed in a robe, whose calculating eyes suggest he sees every view as a potential sale. The merchant acknowledges the risks of their chosen route, bypassing major waterways for a faster but more dangerous path to the central region. Despite warnings about recent unrest and the presence of wind serpents in the area, the man remains confident, asserting that fortune favors the bold and justifying the high payment to the merchant. They both acknowledge the looming threat of the wind serpents, with the merchant dismissively referring to them as \"just a few snakes,\" indicating a nonchalant attitude towards the potential dangers.",

The man remains confident, asserting that fortune favors the bold, while the merchant dismisses the wind serpents as \"just a few snakes.\" The merchant then inquires about the condition of the young man they rescued, expressing relief that he is alive and being cared for by Lijie, but is puzzled by his injuries, suspecting a large, unusual creature as the cause. Rhode, the rescued young man, regains consciousness, disoriented and confused about his surroundings, recalling his virtual battle against the Void Dragon in the Dragon Soul Continent and subsequent death. Seeing blue skies and white clouds through a window, Rhode wonders if he is still dreaming or if there is a problem with the game. Despite the merchant's nonchalance about the wind serpents, the discussion of the rescued young man's injuries and the nature of his virtual reality experience adds a layer of uncertainty and danger to their journey.",

Despite the merchant's dismissal of these creatures as mere \"snakes,\" the crew discusses the puzzling injuries of a recently rescued young man, Rhode, who comes to consciousness in an unfamiliar cabin, disoriented and in pain. His left shoulder and chest are heavily bandaged, a stark contrast to the virtual reality game he was playing, where injuries are purely digital and painless. Realizing he is not in his rented apartment or within the game's familiar landscapes, Rhode identifies his weak, pale arm as proof that he is in his actual body, far from the digital confines of Dragon Soul Continent. As he attempts to make sense of his situation, a blonde girl in a white robe unexpectedly enters the cabin, finding Rhode partially upright, adding another layer of mystery to his sudden and perplexing change of circumstances.",

The crew debates the enigmatic wounds of Rhode, a recently rescued young man and top-ranked player from the digital world of Dragon Soul Continent, who regains consciousness in an alien cabin, disoriented and in agony. With his left shoulder and chest swathed in bandages, Rhode recognizes he's no longer in his rented apartment or the virtual landscape, as evidenced by his frail, pallid arm. As he grapples with his new reality, a blonde girl in a pristine white robe enters, discovering him partly seated and further deepening the enigma. Rhode, who can speak Nim—a language of Dragon Soul Continent—despite never having learned it, is informed by the girl that he was discovered gravely wounded in the Parfield Plains two days ago. She reveals that had it not been for the 'Silver Scale' Chamber of Commerce's ship, his fate might have been grim. Rhode, remembering his last in-game confrontation with the Void Dragon, where he sustained a similar injury, acknowledges the bizarre transference of virtual harm to his physical form. Despite this revelation, he remains calm and learns that his survival is attributed to his robust recovery skills.",
