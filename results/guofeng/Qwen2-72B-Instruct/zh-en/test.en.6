Chapter 437 - Hit A Brick Wall
At this moment, when the Blue Silver Golden Light Array appeared, the flames dimmed instantly, being sucked and guided downwards.
But the fire gourd clearly wasn't that easy to deal with. It forcefully sucked upwards, actually stealing a portion of the flames, then with a "whoosh," it shot off to one side, breaking out of the range of the Blue Silver Golden Light Array.
These changes happened so quickly that they left one feeling unable to take everything in.
Not easy to deal with, this person.
He must be taken down as soon as possible, or the enforcers will arrive.
The fire gourd spat downward, and the woman reappeared, her eyes filled with malice. "What are you doing?"
As she spoke, a flash of golden light appeared under her feet, and a circle of exquisite light patterns quietly emerged, causing the woman's body to stiffen immediately.
Tang Wulin's Bluesilver Grass vines entwined upward with the momentum, Ye Xinglan pointed her Star God Sword forward, aiming for her opponent's chest, while Xie Xie had silently arrived behind her, placing the Light Dragon Dagger against her neck.
It's all part of the plan!
What could be better than Xu Xiaoyan's Starlight Chains when dealing with a single opponent?
The absolute establishment of the Starlight Chains is a heaven-defying existence!
Just as everyone heaved a sigh of relief, thinking they had subdued their opponent, a sudden change occurred! The Star God Sword was already at her front, and the sharpness of the Light Dragon Dagger behind her was at her neck. Under the threat to her life, the woman's eyes suddenly lit up.
A loud phoenix cry resonated from her body, followed immediately by an unparalleled surge of soul power erupting from within her. As if stimulated by something, rings of fiery red light flashed beneath her clothing—these were halos, but they appeared to be part of her attire, located around her neck, shoulders, elbows, waist, and knees. In the very next instant these fiery red lights appeared, an incredibly powerful burst of soul power suddenly erupted from the woman's body.
It was several times more powerful than before. The soul power surged, transforming into a massive ring of fire that billowed outwards. Fine golden patterns emerged on the hovering fire gourd, and what was originally a one-foot-tall fire gourd instantly expanded to two feet in height, growing significantly larger in circumference.
A potent fluctuation of fire elemental energy erupted in an instant, the intense impact forcibly sending Tang Wulin and the others flying. Moreover, the flames clung to them like maggots on bones, burning away at their soul power.
The phoenix cry grew even louder, and the woman exuded an aura of majesty. Immediately after, pieces of dark red armor swiftly appeared, covering her entire body.
On her head was a phoenix helmet, enveloping her head, with the dark red armor extending gracefully to either side in streamlined curves that flowed downward, accentuating feminine features. The smooth lines on her shoulders wrapped around, covering the entire arm.
Dark red flame patterns covered the armor, and on the breastplate was a golden-red phoenix design. The armor wasn't particularly gorgeous, but when this suit of armor covered her, the woman's aura had risen several notches.
Tang Wulin blurted out, his face already filled with bitter laughter.
Battle Armor, yes, this is Battle Armor! Judging by its complexity and the fluctuations of its aura, it should be a One-word Battle Armor. The rings of light appearing around the woman are the tools used to store the Battle Armor.
A one-word Battle Armor cannot yet be integrated into the Battle Armor Master's body.
But even so, this is still a complete set of One-word Battle Armor!
This meant that the woman, originally at the five-ringed cultivation level, had her strength directly elevated to the seven-ringed realm.
At this moment, Yan Feng was furious. She had been in an exceptionally good and happy mood today. Her trip to the Heavenly Spirit Soul Forging Tower earlier was for registration, to officially become a one-word Battle Armor Master.
A Battle Armor Master is a top-tier existence that any organization would willingly support. Just when she signed the contract, the Soul Forging Tower promised her a series of welfare policies. She was only twenty-seven years old this year, making her one of the youngest Battle Armor Masters in Heavenly Spirit City, with boundless prospects for the future.
The Soul Forging Tower has already pledged to assist her by providing a wealth of resources in the future, helping her to advance to the rank of Two-word Battle Armor Master. Once she becomes a Two-word Battle Armor Master, she will truly be considered a Battle Armor Master in every sense of the term, holding a place of distinction across the entire continent.
Who would have thought that just as she left the Soul Forging Tower in high spirits, she would be ambushed by this group of rather young individuals.
Moreover, their abilities were no weak match; if she hadn't used her battle armor, she would have really fallen prey to them just now.
She had no idea that Tang Wulin and the others meant no harm. The Star God Sword and the Light Dragon Dagger made her feel the threat of death.
At that moment, Wu Changkong's voice echoed in the ears of Tang Wulin and the other five, "As long as you defeat her, you will have passed through this city."
Tang Wulin's lips twitched, Teacher Wu, oh Teacher Wu, you have a scheming side too!
This is a one-word Battle Armor Master in her complete state, equivalent to a Soul Sage at the seventh rank; can we really win against someone like her?
Before he could think further, Yan Feng had already made her move. Her formidable soul power surged instantly, and she pointed her right hand at Tang Wulin. The fire gourd above her head immediately spewed a line of fire, which reached Tang Wulin in an instant.
At this point, there was no choice but to give it a shot and fight back; explanations were undoubtedly useless. Judging by the look in her eyes, it was clear that she had been enraged.
They're in the wrong here! Let's deal with it as it comes.
Tang Wulin took a deep breath. The three purple soul rings around his body suddenly vanished, replaced by a golden halo that emerged and blossomed. His right arm swelled as golden dragon scales spread across it. Simultaneously, brilliant star lines rapidly coalesced in his right hand, with the battle armor gauntlet materializing.
Facing a genuine Battle Armor Master, how could he not give it his all!
"Battle Armor?"
Yan Feng was also taken aback when she saw the Battle Armor on Tang Wulin's right hand. The words "impossible" instantly flashed through her mind!
How old is he?
Moreover, she clearly saw that Tang Wulin's Battle Armor surfaced directly from within his body—could it be that he possesses a two-word Battle Armor?
Even though it's just one piece of Battle Armor, to possess Battle Armor at this age is simply unimaginable.
When she first possessed her first piece of Battle Armor at the age of twenty-one, she was still hailed as a genius.
After years of diligent cultivation, she had finally become a true one-word Battle Armor Master.
But how old could these little ones possibly be?
As Tang Wulin sprang into action, the others quickly followed suit.
Xu Lizhi had already retreated to a safe distance. Without a word, buns flew out of his hands—one after another. For each person, there was a Nourishing Soup Bun and a Bloodlust Red Bean Bun.
Tang Wulin, with his left hand behind his back, had already caught the two buns and without hesitation, stuffed them both into his mouth.
It was imperative to finish the battle swiftly.
Even if it's just a one-word Battle Armor set, once fully assembled, it possesses the ability to help Soul Masters rapidly recover their soul power.
Engaging in a prolonged battle with her would leave them with no chance whatsoever.
With a forceful stomp of his left foot on the ground, a thunderous boom echoed as Tang Wulin launched himself upward like a bronze arrow. His right arm shielded his front as his bloodline surged, unleashing the aura of the Golden Dragon King. His eyes turned entirely golden, and the气血fluctuation emanating from his body carried an intense and fierce quality.
With the Golden Dragon Claw of his right hand guarding his front, he forcefully met the opposing flames, charging forward despite the onslaught.
As the team leader and a strong offensive-type Battle Soul Master, he could not afford to retreat even the slightest bit; only by holding the front line would his teammates have a chance.
Stimulated by the Bloodlust Red Bean Bun, his soul power and blood essence energy instantly surged to their peak, causing faint golden scales to appear all over his skin. The scales on his right hand, right arm, and right chest were particularly dazzling.
Does he possess dual martial souls?
Yan Feng was taken aback.
"Hmph!"
She did not dodge at all. The fire gourd above her head suddenly spun, transforming the original line of fire into a broad spray of flames that swept over Tang Wulin's head, enveloping towards his companions and blocking the others.
She wanted to isolate Tang Wulin, intending to deal with this little guy who was clearly the leader of the opposing side first.
The Golden Dragon Claw arrived before his opponent like a bolt of lightning, and Yan Feng also raised her right hand, forming a fist to meet it head-on.
As the clash seemed imminent, the dragon roar within Tang Wulin intensified abruptly. Without any warning, a massive golden dragon head, more than two feet in diameter, materialized, engulfing Yan Feng's right arm directly.
Golden Dragon Stuns the Heavens!
After consuming the Ruby Shrimp that day, although Tang Wulin was unable to break the fourth seal of the Golden Dragon King, his vital energy did experience a significant boost, enabling him to wield the Golden Dragon Stuns the Heavens technique with greater mastery.
Yan Feng was also taken aback; she felt a tremendous force coming straight at her. Immediately after, the flames from her punch seemed to be devoured, as the Golden Dragon Claw, akin to a large pair of pliers, grabbed hold of her right hand.
The Golden Dragon Claw exerted its might, causing Yan Feng's one-word Battle Armor to glow brilliantly. All the flame patterns on it seemed to come alive, especially the fire phoenix on her chest, which actually moved, transforming into a phoenix fire shadow that charged directly toward Tang Wulin's chest.
