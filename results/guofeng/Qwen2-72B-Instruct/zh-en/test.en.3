Chapter 1898: Unforgettable Even If I Don't Think About It (Part 4)
Yan Rusheng rolled his eyes at her. "Wen Xuxu, you're being narcissistic."
"Is it that I don't look good?"
Wen Xuxu furrowed her brows, pouting as if she was feigning anger.
Yan Rusheng was taken aback for a moment before he started laughing. The hand that was supporting Xuxu's upper body squeezed her breast hard.
Staring down at her, he gritted his teeth, "... sly dumb woman."
He quickened his pace, walking over to the bed where he showed no gentleness or care, tossing Xuxu onto it directly. Then, he began unbuttoning his shirt hurriedly, not waiting for one button to be fully undone before moving on to the next.
Unbuckling his belt and shedding all his restraints, he then slipped into the blankets, pinning Xuxu beneath him.
Rude and crude, not the least bit romantic.
His deep, dark eyes locked with hers, causing Xuxu's heart to race uncontrollably.
Yes, after being together for so many years, every time she looked into his eyes like this, her heart still pounded like a fawn, filled with shyness and embarrassment.
Perhaps it was because they were too familiar with each other, but she always felt a sense of embarrassment.
That's why people say it's hard to make a move on someone you know well, just like how rabbits don't eat the grass near their burrows; it really is like that.
Seeing Xuxu's blushing and shyness, Yan Rusheng felt a mix of excitement and frustration; the excitement was his body's automatic hormonal response, while the frustration stemmed from his inner self.
While he enjoyed seeing her shy appearance, he didn't like how her shyness made her awkward and reserved, always holding back instead of taking the initiative.
"What else do you want to hear? I'll tell you everything, just look at me."
Yan Rusheng cupped Xuxu's face in his hands, forcing her to meet his gaze.
Xuxu's face turned even redder; she pouted, her eyes wandering restlessly. "Then hurry up and tell me, did you also steal love letters that others gave me."
"Uh..."
Yan Rusheng put on a thinking face, speaking as he thought, "Aside from Zhao Zheng's love letter, Jiang Zheheng's chocolate and movie tickets, there were also the rainbow lollipops from Hao Bang, the son of Police Chief Hao from the Public Security Bureau who was one year older than us."
Hearing this, Xuxu was surprised. "What? Hao Bang?"
The science top scorer who was supposedly praised by ten thousand people?
The reason he was known as 'Praised by Ten Thousand People' was because of his name, not that he was actually praised by ten thousand people; simply calling out his name was a way of complimenting how great he was.
When she first heard this name and learned that there was someone at school with such a name, she also found it quite disheartening.
But wasn't that guy just a bookworm? How did he also send her things?
"Yes, the name is really lowbrow, and the person who came up with the name is even lower."
Yan Rusheng spoke with a look of disdain, "Fortunately, I ate that lollipop for you. All those rainbow colors were just food dye; they stained my tongue and lips all sorts of colors back then. Junk food, cheap stuff."
Xuxu: "..."
According to him, she should thank him for eating something that someone else had given her?
Xuxu found herself both exasperated and amused, unable to hold back any longer, she reached out and poked Yan Rusheng hard on the forehead. "Yan Rusheng, why don't you just fly up to the heavens?"
Truly taking advantage and still playing coy, this was exactly the sort of thing he loved doing most.
After saying that, she looked at him again and asked amusingly, "So you used to dislike Chief Hao because of Hao Bang?"
Although it was a question, her tone was certain.
"..." Yan Rusheng pursed his lips in silence, tacitly admitting as much.
Xuxu, caught off guard, found herself once again lost in his deep, dark eyes. She pouted and made a little 'uh' sound, her gaze awkwardly shifting away again.
Then she asked, "How did you manage to do all these things? Why didn't I know about them?"
She pursed her lips, as if she was making conversation just for the sake of it.
