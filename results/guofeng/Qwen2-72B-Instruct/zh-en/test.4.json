Strangely, Bai Weiwei's corpse shows no signs of decomposition or typical post-mortem changes; her appearance has even improved, and she looks as though she is just sleeping. Muyan Jun, who hasn't slept in five days and appears exhausted but abnormally lucid, watches over her. A divine doctor, referred to as an \"old quack,\" arrives after a difficult journey, complaining about the toll it took on him. Muyan Jun informs the doctor that Bai Weiwei has been in this state since he administered medicine to her and requests his expertise to determine when she might awaken. The doctor examines Bai Weiwei and remarks that her condition is a rare phenomenon that doesn't require treatment but necessitates an important action. Intrigued, Muyan Jun listens intently, with the doctor hinting that he must treat another individual as part of the process. Muyan Jun leans in closely, eager not to miss any detail.",
