        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 369: Out of Danger, a fierce battle unfolds between two opposing forces, with gunfire and smoke engulfing the sea. Bai Ye skillfully wields his high-speed magnetic wave scanner gun, taking down enemy aircrafts. Xiaonai expertly commands the First Terrorist Organization's air force, orchestrating a powerful offensive and defensive formation for their final assault. As the tide turns against Nicolay's side, he urges a retreat to avoid total annihilation, a sentiment reluctantly agreed upon by Louis, who is consumed by malice and unwillingness to concede after coming so close to victory. Louis acknowledges the fortunate escape of his adversaries but vows not to let them off easily.\n\nBai Ye, holding his magnetic wave scanner gun with fondness, considers chasing the retreating foes but ultimately decides against it, echoing Xiaonai's sentiments that it would be premature to end their game so soon. Xiaonai, with his calm and collected demeanor, asserts that the tables have turned significantly and that Louis should not have provoked him. Seeking retribution for Nono's death, Xiaonai is determined to make someone pay, and while Louis may initiate the conflict, its conclusion lies in Xiaonai's hands.\n\nBai Ye concurs with Xiaonai's decision, suggesting that they have ample resources to engage in a prolonged game with Louis, and predicts that others might intervene against Louis before he can even act. Communicating with Chu Li, Bai Ye calls off any further backup and orders a return to Rome. Black Hawk and his team carefully retrieve Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya, mindful of the viruses they carry, with Ye Sanshao's warning adding to their caution.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 369: Out of Danger, a brutal naval confrontation ensues, featuring Bai Ye's strategic use of his high-speed magnetic wave scanner gun to decimate enemy aircraft, complemented by Xiaonai's adept leadership over the First Terrorist Organization's air force, orchestrating a formidable formation that forces Nicolay's retreat to prevent total defeat. Despite Louis's reluctance, driven by malevolence and an unwillingness to accept near-victory's elusiveness, he concedes to Nicolay's withdrawal, vowing retribution against their fortunate escape. Bai Ye, considering but dismissing the pursuit, aligns with Xiaonai's perspective that ending the conflict prematurely would be unwise, affirming that Louis's aggression has shifted the balance of power, and that Xiaonai, intent on avenging Nono's demise, holds the key to the conflict's resolution. Bai Ye anticipates external interventions against Louis before he can retaliate, communicating with Chu Li to stand down additional reinforcements and return to Rome. Black Hawk and his team cautiously recover Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya, wary of the viral threat they carry.\n\nExhausted from swimming while supporting Cheng Anya, Ye Sanshao arrives safely, joking about her needing to slim down due to the perceived burden. Onboard the plane, the atmosphere is jovial as Black Hawk and crew offer aid and banter. Cheng Anya, ignoring Ye Sanshao's jests, warms up with a blanket and towel, sneezing from the chill. Black Hawk humorously suggests that if Cheng Anya were to lose more weight, Ye Sanshao might find her too thin, a notion Ye Sanshao supports, attributing her heaviness to her slender build. After donning oversized clothes from Black Hawk, Cheng Anya receives a call from Ningning, whom she scolds affectionately for tardy communication, threatening punishment upon their reunion in Rome. Touched by a past vow, Ningning confirms his safety, lamenting her absence and asserting his eagerness for her presence, to which she responds with concern for his well-being, concluding their conversation as the plane prepares to land.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 369: Out of Danger, a fierce naval battle unfolds, marked by Bai Ye's tactical deployment of his high-speed magnetic wave scanner gun to obliterate enemy aircraft and Xiaonai's masterful command over the First Terrorist Organization's air force, executing a potent formation that compels Nicolay to withdraw to avert total annihilation. Louis, fueled by malice and the sting of near-victory slipping away, reluctantly agrees to Nicolay's retreat, swearing vengeance for their adversaries' narrow escape. Bai Ye contemplates but rejects the idea of pursuing them, aligning with Xiaonai's judgment that precipitously ending the clash could be ill-advised. They recognize that Louis's belligerence has tipped the power scales, and Xiaonai, determined to avenge Nono's death, holds the critical piece to resolving the conflict. Bai Ye foresees external interference against Louis before he can strike back, instructing Chu Li to stand down further reinforcements and return to Rome. Meanwhile, Black Hawk and his squad carefully retrieve Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya, mindful of the viral risk they pose.\n\nAfter a strenuous swim while assisting Cheng Anya, Ye Sanshao arrives safely, making light of her weight as a survival strategy. Aboard the plane, Black Hawk and the crew provide assistance and engage in good-natured repartee. Cheng Anya, dismissing Ye Sanshao's teasing, warms herself with a blanket and towel, sneezing from the cold. Black Hawk jokingly remarks that if Cheng Anya were to lose more weight, Ye Sanshao might consider her too skinny, a comment Ye Sanshao endorses, blaming her apparent heaviness on her slim figure. Dressed in oversized clothing provided by Black Hawk, Cheng Anya receives a call from Ningning, whom she gently scolds for his late communication, promising discipline upon their meeting in Rome. Touched by a previous promise, Ningning assures her of his safety, yearning for her presence, and expresses sadness over her absence. Cheng Anya voices concern for his welfare before concluding their conversation as the aircraft readies for landing.\n\nUpon landing at the castle, where Chu Li, Ye Wei, Eleven, and others await, Xiaonai concludes his call with Cheng Anya, who is attempting to warm herself with hot water. Ye Sanshao, eager to speak with his son, is disappointed when the conversation ends abruptly. He casts a reproachful look at Cheng Anya, who disregards him. Black Hawk informs them that the plane will touch down soon, and Ye Sanshao will reunite with his son shortly. Feeling neglected, Ye Sanshao playfully pinches Cheng Anya, calling her heartless. She reciprocates with a playful retort, labeling him spiteful, and hands him her cup of hot water, which he consumes. The aircraft lands smoothly on the castle grounds, and upon seeing Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya unharmed, everyone breathes a sigh of relief. Ye Wei jests about their appearance, suggesting she should have captured it on camera. Ye Sanshao laughs, comforted by the sight of Weiwei, Eleven, and Xiaonai's safety. Xiaonai desires to embrace Cheng Anya but remembers her viral infection and notices his parents' intertwined hands. He requests Bai Ye, a gifted physician, to examine them. Bai Ye acknowledges the situation, confirming the presence of a virus, but someone questions whether this falls beyond his medical expertise.",

Louis, driven by spite and the bitter taste of victory snatched away, begrudgingly concedes to Nicolay's withdrawal, vowing retribution. Despite contemplating pursuit, Bai Ye aligns with Xiaonai's cautious approach, recognizing the volatile shift in power dynamics due to Louis's aggression. Xiaonai, intent on avenging Nono's demise, holds the key to resolving the conflict. Anticipating external intervention against Louis, Bai Ye advises Chu Li to halt reinforcements and return to Rome. Amidst the chaos, Black Hawk and his team cautiously rescue Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya, navigating the risks posed by their potential viral contamination.\n\nUpon reaching safety, Ye Sanshao jokes about Cheng Anya's weight as a survival tactic, while she recuperates aboard the plane, wrapped in a blanket. Black Hawk engages in lighthearted banter, and Cheng Anya receives a call from Ningning, chiding him for tardy communication and promising discipline upon their reunion in Rome. Ningning, touched by past promises, assures her of his safety, longing for her presence. After landing at the castle, greeted by Chu Li, Ye Wei, Eleven, and others, Ye Sanshao yearns to connect with his son but is momentarily thwarted. Reunited soon after, Ye Sanshao playfully teases Cheng Anya, who reciprocates, and they are welcomed by their loved ones, relieved to see them unscathed. Ye Wei jokes about capturing their disheveled state, while Xiaonai, mindful of Cheng Anya's viral infection, refrains from embracing her. Bai Ye confirms the presence of a virus, prompting a query about the limits of his medical expertise.\n\nAmid the reunion, Bai Ye, affectionately nicknamed \"Little White\" by Jason, faces a challenge when Jason insists on using the moniker, citing a precedent set by his own nickname, \"Little Iron.\" Jason, the Firebreather, is depicted as a formidable figure with a commanding presence. Black Jack, a Sino-British mixed-race individual, exudes charm and perceptiveness. Ye Wei, dismissing any dispute, advises Ye Chen and Cheng Anya to bathe and seek medical care to ward off illness. Xiaonai, clinging to Bai Ye, seeks reassurance about his parents' health, demonstrating a childlike trust. Jason, brimming with confidence, guarantees Bai Ye's abilities, even to resurrect the deceased, and invites him to fortify the Mafia's defenses. A playful chase ensues between Black Jack and Jason, adding levity to the situation.\n\nIn an unexpected twist, Jason, while holding Xiaonai, reveals a paternal yearning, expressing a wish to adopt him, infusing the scene with a blend of surprise, humor, and familial bonds, setting the stage for unfolding events.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 369: Out of Danger, a critical naval battle unfolds where Bai Ye, using his advanced magnetic wave scanner gun, devastates enemy aircraft alongside Xiaonai's tactical command over the First Terrorist Organization's air force, compelling Nicolay to retreat, much to Louis's chagrin, who vows retaliation. Recognizing the shifting power dynamics due to Louis's aggression, Bai Ye and Xiaonai decide against pursuing Nicolay, with Bai Ye advising Chu Li to halt reinforcements and return to Rome. Meanwhile, Black Hawk and his team rescue Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya, who may have been exposed to a virus. Upon reaching safety, the group engages in light-hearted banter, with Cheng Anya receiving a call from Ningning, who scolds her for late communication and promises discipline upon their reunion in Rome. At the castle, they are greeted by Chu Li, Ye Wei, Eleven, and others, and amidst the joyous reunion, Ye Sanshao teases Cheng Anya, who responds in kind. Ye Wei jokes about capturing their disheveled appearance, while Xiaonai, mindful of Cheng Anya's potential infection, refrains from close contact. Bai Ye confirms the presence of a virus and is questioned about his medical capabilities. \n\nDuring the reunion, Bai Ye, known as \"Little White,\" faces a playful challenge from Jason, who insists on using the nickname, referencing his own moniker, \"Little Iron.\" Jason, the Firebreather, is portrayed as a powerful figure, while Black Jack, a Sino-British mixed-race individual, exhibits charm and perceptiveness. Ye Wei advises Ye Chen and Cheng Anya to bathe and seek medical attention to avoid illness. Xiaonai clings to Bai Ye, seeking reassurance about his parents' health, and Jason boasts of Bai Ye's abilities, even claiming he could bring back the dead, inviting him to bolster the Mafia's defenses. This leads to a humorous chase between Black Jack and Jason. Unexpectedly, Jason, holding Xiaonai, expresses a paternal desire to adopt him, blending surprise, humor, and family warmth into the scene.\n\nBai Ye advises Jason to improve his Chinese proficiency and clarifies their differing statuses. Xiaonai seeks assurance about his parents' well-being, and Bai Ye commits to assisting them. Ye Wei entrusts the situation to Bai Ye, confident in his ability to resolve the issue caused by Louis's virus. Chu Li concurs, and Jason jests about Bai Ye needing a signboard, which amuses Eleven. Black Jack queries why Louis remains at large despite his preoccupation with personal matters post-bombing. Xiaonai posits that Louis is not their primary concern, advocating for a strategic victory without direct conflict. He suspects an internal Mafia faction enabling Louis's audacity and plans to exploit Louis to expose and eradicate this clandestine power. The group acknowledges the shrewdness of this strategy, setting the stage for future developments.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 369: Out of Danger, a pivotal naval confrontation takes place where Bai Ye, utilizing his advanced magnetic wave scanner gun, decimates enemy aircraft under Xiaonai's strategic command against the First Terrorist Organization's air force, forcing Nicolay to withdraw. Despite Louis's vow for revenge, Bai Ye and Xiaonai opt against pursuit, with Bai Ye instructing Chu Li to cease reinforcements and return to Rome. Amidst these events, Black Hawk's team rescues Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya, who might be infected with a virus. After reaching safety, the group engages in lighthearted exchanges, with Cheng Anya receiving a scolding call from Ningning for delayed communication, promising discipline upon their reunion in Rome. At the castle, they are welcomed by Chu Li, Ye Wei, Eleven, and others. During the reunion, playful interactions ensue, including Ye Sanshao teasing Cheng Anya, Ye Wei's joke about capturing their disarray, and Xiaonai's cautious distance due to potential infection concerns. Bai Ye confirms the virus's presence and is queried about his medical expertise.\n\nBai Ye, known as \"Little White,\" encounters Jason's playful challenge regarding nicknames, with Jason, the Firebreather, being a formidable figure, and Black Jack, a Sino-British mix, displaying charm and insight. Ye Wei advises Ye Chen and Cheng Anya to cleanse and seek medical care. Xiaonai clings to Bai Ye for reassurance about his parents' health, and Jason boasts of Bai Ye's prowess, even suggesting he could resurrect the dead, prompting an offer to bolster the Mafia's defenses. This results in a comical chase involving Black Jack and Jason. Surprisingly, Jason, holding Xiaonai, expresses a paternal wish to adopt him, blending astonishment, humor, and familial warmth into the scene.\n\nBai Ye instructs Jason to enhance his Chinese skills and clarifies their distinct statuses. Xiaonai seeks confirmation about his parents' welfare, and Bai Ye pledges assistance. Ye Wei trusts Bai Ye to address the situation caused by Louis's virus. Chu Li agrees, and Jason jokes about Bai Ye needing a signboard, delighting Eleven. Black Jack questions why Louis remains at large despite his preoccupation with personal matters post-bombing. Xiaonai argues that Louis isn't their main focus, advocating for a strategic triumph without direct confrontation. He suspects an internal Mafia faction empowering Louis's audacity and plans to utilize Louis to reveal and eliminate this hidden influence. The group recognizes the astuteness of this plan, setting the stage for subsequent events.\n\nDespite acknowledging his manipulative nature, a youthful individual benefits from others' leniency due to his seemingly harmless appearance. Jason follows through on plans crafted by Black Jack, Chu Li, and Xiaonai, illustrating the efficacy of a decisive executor backed by a robust advisory team. Chu Li aligns with Ningning's approach for peace and deterrence, while Black Jack humorously notes Chu Li's agreement with Ningning, yet concurs that a lesson must be taught to the Mafia to ensure their restraint for years. Bai Ye concentrates on finding a cure for the virus impacting Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya, delegating other concerns to Chu Li. Ye Wei and Eleven speculate that Mo Ye and Mo Jue might be significant players within the Mafia, potentially wielding more authority than Louis and acting independently of his control. The group proceeds to the living room, and Xiaonai approaches Cheng Anya, who has just bathed and is sipping tea, her face flushed and body warm. She reflects on his evolution into a more mature and potentially perilous figure, devoid of his former innocence, and instructs him to sit across from her to prevent an inadvertent blow.\n\nIn essence, a cunning young individual capitalizes on others' tolerance due to his deceptive innocence. Jason implements strategies devised by others, highlighting the strength of a resolute actor with strategic guidance. Chu Li endorses Ningning's peacekeeping strategy and deterrence tactics, while Black Jack jests about their accord. Focused on curing the virus, Bai Ye leaves other matters to Chu Li. Ye Wei and Eleven theorize that Mo Ye and Mo Jue could be influential Mafia members, possibly more powerful than Louis. The group shifts to the living room, and Cheng Anya, post-bath and pensive, interacts with Xiaonai, noting his maturation and emerging danger.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In a series of pivotal events, Bai Ye, using advanced technology, decimates enemy aircraft under Xiaonai's strategic guidance, leading to a retreat by the First Terrorist Organization's forces. Post-battle, amidst lighthearted exchanges and reunions at the castle, it's revealed that Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya may be infected with a virus. Upon reaching safety, Cheng Anya receives a scolding call from Ningning for delayed communication, with promises of discipline upon their reunion in Rome. The group is welcomed by Chu Li, Ye Wei, Eleven, and others, engaging in playful interactions, including Ye Wei's joke about capturing their disarray and Xiaonai's cautious distance due to potential infection concerns. Bai Ye confirms the virus's presence and is questioned about his medical expertise.\n\nBai Ye, known as \"Little White,\" faces Jason's playful challenge regarding nicknames, with Jason being a formidable figure and Black Jack, a Sino-British mix, displaying charm and insight. Ye Wei advises Ye Chen and Cheng Anya to cleanse and seek medical care. Xiaonai clings to Bai Ye for reassurance about his parents' health, and Jason boasts of Bai Ye's prowess, even suggesting he could resurrect the dead, prompting an offer to bolster the Mafia's defenses. This leads to a comical chase involving Black Jack and Jason. Surprisingly, Jason, holding Xiaonai, expresses a paternal wish to adopt him, blending astonishment, humor, and familial warmth into the scene.\n\nBai Ye instructs Jason to improve his Chinese skills and clarifies their distinct statuses. Xiaonai seeks confirmation about his parents' welfare, and Bai Ye pledges assistance. Ye Wei trusts Bai Ye to address the situation caused by Louis's virus. Chu Li agrees, and Jason jokes about Bai Ye needing a signboard, delighting Eleven. Black Jack questions why Louis remains at large despite his preoccupation with personal matters post-bombing. Xiaonai argues that Louis isn't their main focus, advocating for a strategic triumph without direct confrontation. He suspects an internal Mafia faction empowering Louis's audacity and plans to utilize Louis to reveal and eliminate this hidden influence. The group recognizes the astuteness of this plan, setting the stage for subsequent events.\n\nIn the living room, Xiaonai approaches Cheng Anya, who has just bathed and is sipping tea, reflecting on his evolution into a more mature and potentially perilous figure, devoid of his former innocence. She instructs him to sit across from her to prevent an inadvertent blow. Xiaonai, displaying a hint of his father's narcissism, jokingly asks if she admires his handsomeness. Cheng Anya, concerned, inquires if he has been alright and if anyone has bullied him, referring to photos sent by Louis showing Xiaonai injured. Xiaonai denies any trouble, assuring her that the photos were manipulated. To prove his point, he shows his unscarred arm, indicating that a previous bullet wound is healing well, and he bears no grudge for past injuries, especially those inflicted by Nono, as they remind him of her. Cheng Anya, noticing a brief flash of pain in his eyes, presses further, but Xiaonai reassures her that he is fine and shifts the topic to her and his father's health issues, mentioning a virus that Uncle Black Hawk mentioned, which both his parents seem to have contracted under unspecified circumstances involving physical proximity. \n\nThroughout these events, a cunning young individual capitalizes on others' tolerance due to his deceptive innocence. Jason implements strategies devised by others, highlighting the strength of a resolute actor with strategic guidance. Chu Li endorses Ningning's peacekeeping strategy and deterrence tactics, while Black Jack jests about their accord. Focused on curing the virus, Bai Ye leaves other matters to Chu Li. Ye Wei and Eleven theorize that Mo Ye and Mo Jue could be influential Mafia members, possibly more powerful than Louis. The group proceeds to strategize and care for one another, setting the stage for further developments in their complex relationships and ongoing battles against internal and external threats.",
