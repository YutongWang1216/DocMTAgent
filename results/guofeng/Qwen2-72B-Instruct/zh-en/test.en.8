Chapter 455: Reversal 3
"The purpose is just to let you experience the fluctuation of aura, it's really very simple." Another術士 beside him couldn't help but interject with a smile. 
"Then I'll trouble you."
Lin Sheng nodded.
He needed to find the other fragments as quickly as possible. Originally, he had planned to subdue more malevolent spirits to obtain more pure soul power.
However, now that he had encountered such an opportunity, obtaining it as quickly as possible was the way to go.
Soon, the Head Acolyte led Lin Sheng to stand in front of a malevolent spirit gate.
The two of them reached out and gently touched the frame of the malevolent spirit gate at the same time, closing their eyes.
The Head Acolyte swiftly began constructing a spatial baseplate with his paranormal abilities, establishing it as a coordinate reference.
Then, following the ritual fluctuations of the malevolent spirit gate, taking along Lin Sheng's perceptual consciousness, they were together launched out by the ritual fluctuations.
"The ordinary teleportation gate ritual is point-to-point directional transmission."
"But when we usually explore other spatial mysteries, we transform this point-to-point into point-to-multipoint."
"This only requires modifying a few minor parameters on the teleportation baseplate."
The Head Acolyte guided Lin Sheng's consciousness while imparting the relevant techniques.
"In this way, the malevolent spirit gate will spontaneously transmit our consciousness to multiple possible locations of similar target spaces."
"This is essentially using energy to take a chance; if luck is on our side, we might just stumble upon the spatial mystery we desire at once. If not, we'll have to waste energy and try multiple times."
"It's truly random enough."
Lin Sheng was speechless.
The moment his perception entered the malevolent spirit gate, it was immediately enveloped by the ritual fluctuations within and launched outward.
At the same time, it was as if his consciousness had split; his perceptual awareness was divided into more than ten portions, simultaneously sensing the completely different spatial atmospheres of over ten places.
"Generally speaking, it's difficult for our consciousness to maintain integrity during the transmission process, so we can only try to memorize the spatial coordinates that the main consciousness comes into contact with."
"The memory of coordinates requires us to leave behind a simple marker...."
The Head Acolyte continued to explain softly from outside, guiding Lin Sheng and instructing him on how to create a simple marker to determine the coordinate codes.
But he had never expected that due to the exceedingly powerful and tenacious spirit soul of the Spirit Lock, after being split, he could remember the coordinates of every space that each of the dozen or so fragments of consciousness came into contact with.
It was just a matter of multitasking with over ten things at once. For Lin Sheng, whose soul consciousness could handle N tasks simultaneously, this wasn't much of a challenge. He practiced juggling dozens of tasks at once every day.
He could control and observe each summon through the fragmented spirit soul. Therefore, although he couldn't yet manage to have one person simultaneously controlling many summons acting independently,
But it's merely about memorizing the aura fluctuations and establishing coordinates separately.
Given his inherently stronger and more durable soul compared to the average person, allowing for longer periods of existence, this task was still quite effortless for him.
Ten minutes later. His consciousness was thoroughly depleted, dissipating away.
Lin Sheng opened his eyes and looked at the Head Acolyte and the others.
"Pinpoint the spatial mystery corresponding to these coordinates." He immediately, under the astonished gazes of the Head Acolyte and the others, revealed one of the special spatial mystery coordinates.
The spatial mystery at this coordinate is precisely what Lin Sheng perceived—a unique space that shares the same origin as the Yin-to-Evil Wheel fragment in his possession.
"Did we succeed on the first try?"
The Head Acolyte felt a twinge of bitterness; when he first sensed the spatial aura and confirmed the coordinates, recording them had taken him over half a month to accomplish.
"It's a very simple operation."
"Let's begin, set up the teleportation portal."
"I'm going over." Lin Sheng instructed.
"Yes."
"Wait for the main body."
Heavenly Artifice Xia's soul communication caused Lin Sheng's movements to pause.
"What?"
He watched as the Head Acolyte and the others began to instruct the malevolent spirits to move materials and resources over, while he walked to the side to wait, simultaneously exchanging messages with Heavenly Artifice Xia in his mind.
"There's a situation here. There's been a major shift at the Bishaga Islands!"
Heavenly Artifice Xia's tone was subtly grave.
This was a sign Lin Sheng had never seen before.
It's worth noting that even when he revealed the existence of the King of Night to Heavenly Artifice Xia, he had never seen her so serious.
This made him feel a slight sense of unusual tension.
"Shouldn't Mi Yue be at an absolute disadvantage?"
Lin Sheng asked with a frown.
"Or has new combat power joined in?"
"No, it's not new combat power," Heavenly Artifice Xia said solemnly.
"Rather, Mi Yue deceived everyone!"
"What? What happened?"
"The Seven-Lock Tower had long been successfully summoned; Mi Yue deceived everyone in the three great mystic realms! He had already successfully summoned Faludo, using himself as a sacrifice! And merged with it!"
Lin Sheng's consciousness suddenly paused.
"Using oneself as a sacrifice?"
"......This madman!"
"So, what the three great mystic realms are now facing is the fusion monstrosity of Mi Yue and Faludo...."
Lin Sheng was at a loss for words.
"What should we do now?"
Heavenly Artifice Xia spoke gravely.
The combination of Faludo and Mi Yue isn't as simple as one plus one equals two; rather, it results in a multiplication effect, akin to three times ten.
"Do not get agitated."
"For Mi Yue and Faludo, their greatest adversaries remain the three great mystic realms and numerous other major forces."
"And this world is not as simple as you think it is."
Lin Sheng recalled the information he had gathered from previous investigations.
"The Great Star Pool, and those家伙holding the Mandate Holy Implements, aren't simple characters either." 
"As long as he doesn't provoke us, we don't care how they develop."
"I understand what you mean."
"Still, it's best to prepare early," Heavenly Artifice Xia advised.
"I once possessed destructive power at that level. It was during the time when I was under the control of the demon sword."
"So I am well aware of the consequences that a power of that level can bring about."
Lin Sheng fell silent.
Among all his subordinates, Heavenly Artifice Xia was the most unique. This was because Heavenly Artifice Xia had once been influenced and controlled by a peculiarly powerful entity.
Back then, she had even detected Lin Sheng's prying during her memory recall.
Just a residual image imprint in her memory managed to detect Lin Sheng, who was observing her memories.
Such overwhelming strength surpasses Lin Sheng's comprehension.
"I understand." Lin Sheng replied once again.
"I will make the necessary preparations."
"Rest assured."
Worst comes to worst, I can activate the strongest special state and summon the powers of all my commanders, integrating them into myself.
Disconnecting from Heavenly Artifice Xia, Lin Sheng silently gazed at the newly constructed malevolent spirit gate. His thoughts returned to their original train of thought.
"Open it then, Your Excellency," the Head Acolyte said softly.
Lin Sheng gazed at the teleportation portal, falling silent for a moment.
"Have the King of Demons come over. Also, Dejia!"
Dejia's demonic hand had already arrived nearby to await.
Hearing the summons, he immediately walked in from the doorway.
"Your Excellency, as you command."
Lin Sheng nodded.
"I intend to open multiple portals simultaneously to explore various malevolent spirit spaces."
"You select one hundred Greater Malevolent Spirits, divide them into teams of varying sizes, and send them out to conduct exploratory missions separately."
"As ordered!"
Dejia's demonic hand felt a chill in his heart, knowing that it was likely His Excellency had encountered some sort of twist.
Otherwise, there wouldn't be such a sudden, urgent large-scale operation to explore.
