Chen Ge clarifies that the East Campus isn't inherently dangerous but operates under a different management style, with residents living in genuine fear compared to the false happiness of the West Campus. He explains that East Campus students, despite being trapped within the school just like the West Campus students, are closer to hope because they remember their identities and seek ways to escape. This contrasts with West Campus students whose memories have been altered, living a life designed by someone else. Chen Ge points out that the wall separating the two campuses exists due to the school's fear of losing control and its misguided attempts to reshape humanity, forgetting the complexity of human nature. He emphasizes that forgetting past deeds does not erase their existence, hinting at the failure of the school's plans. His revelations about the school's true nature pique the curiosity of the club members, leading to a proposal to visit the East Campus immediately.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 805, titled \"The Last Story,\" Zhou Tu hesitates about visiting the East Campus after hearing warnings about its dangers from seniors and teachers. Chen Ge clarifies that the East Campus isn't inherently perilous; rather, it operates under a different management style where residents live in genuine fear, unlike the false happiness of the West Campus. He reveals that East Campus students, though also trapped within the school, are closer to hope because they remember their identities and actively seek escape routes, unlike their West Campus counterparts whose memories have been manipulated and who live lives crafted by someone else. Chen Ge attributes the division between the two campuses to the school's fear of losing control and its flawed efforts to reshape humanity, ignoring the inherent complexities of human nature. He stresses that erasing past actions doesn't remove their impact, suggesting the futility of the school's plans. Intrigued by these revelations, the club members propose an immediate trip to the East Campus.\n\nHowever, Zhou Tu questions the feasibility of finding a suitable art studio there, considering the circumstances. Chen Ge notices a significant transformation in the dark figure from dormitory 413, whose shadow, now more potent and inky-black, holds great potential. He plans to harness this power by organizing student expeditions to the East Campus to combat isolated malevolent spirits, aiming to bolster his own strength and divert attention from another hidden threat on campus. Aware of his current developmental stage, Chen Ge intends to accumulate as many strategic advantages as possible before the school authorities detect the \"bug.\" Shifting focus to Wang Yicheng, the first club member to join whose story remains untold, Chen Ge suggests visiting his dormitory. Initially resistant and visibly anxious, Wang Yicheng eventually agrees, guiding them to dormitory 413 in the West Campus—a parallel to Lin Sisi's dorm number but with strikingly different residency patterns. Chen Ge reiterates the importance of maintaining club secrecy and discretion, acknowledging that while some faculty members might be lenient, others are less tolerant.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 805, \"The Last Story,\" Zhou Tu is initially hesitant to visit the East Campus due to warnings about its dangers, but Chen Ge clarifies that the East Campus isn't inherently perilous; instead, it operates under a different management style that fosters genuine fear rather than the false happiness of the West Campus. He reveals that East Campus students, though also trapped, are closer to hope as they remember their identities and actively search for escape routes, unlike their memory-manipulated West Campus counterparts. Chen Ge attributes this divide to the school's fear of losing control and its misguided attempts to reshape humanity, emphasizing that erasing past actions doesn't negate their consequences. Intrigued, the club members suggest an immediate trip to the East Campus. However, Zhou Tu questions the practicality of finding an art studio there, prompting Chen Ge to notice the dark figure from dormitory 413, whose shadow has become more potent, holding significant potential. He plans to leverage this power by organizing student expeditions to the East Campus to fight isolated malevolent spirits, aiming to strengthen himself and divert attention from another hidden threat on campus. Chen Ge, aware of his current developmental stage, seeks to accumulate strategic advantages before the school authorities detect the \"bug.\" Focusing on Wang Yicheng, the first club member whose story is yet to be told, Chen Ge proposes visiting his dormitory, despite initial resistance. They head to dormitory 413 in the West Campus, paralleling Lin Sisi's dorm number but with distinct residency patterns. Chen Ge emphasizes the need for secrecy and discretion regarding the club, noting varying faculty attitudes.\n\nChen Ge remains vigilant due to the disturbance caused in the laboratory building, fearing an investigation by the school authorities. After exploring Room 413, he plans to stay low. The West Campus houses four male dormitory buildings, accommodating significantly more students than the East Campus. Despite the late hour, the dormitories remain lively with ongoing activities. The dorm layout mirrors the East Campus, allowing Chen Ge and the club members to blend in effortlessly as they enter the first dormitory building. The dorm supervisor's quarters display a notice prohibiting high-power electrical appliances and cooking, differing from the East Campus notice, which warns of recent serious incidents and restricts nighttime outings. This contrast highlights the feeling of being on opposite sides of a metaphorical \"door.\"\n\nUpon reaching Dormitory 413, Chen Ge and the club members observe the roommates continuing their activities, largely ignoring Wang Yicheng. One boy near the door shows unusual disdain for Wang Yicheng, scolding him for not closing the door. Chen Ge explains the situation and offers an apology, although uncertain of its form. The boy falls silent upon seeing Chen Ge and retreats behind his mosquito net. Wang Yicheng points out Bed No.4, used for storage as it's unoccupied, unlike the other beds where belongings are kept under them. This visit to Dormitory 413 underscores the unique dynamics and secrets harbored within the West Campus, further highlighting the stark differences between the two campuses and the complex web of relationships and rules governing student life.",
