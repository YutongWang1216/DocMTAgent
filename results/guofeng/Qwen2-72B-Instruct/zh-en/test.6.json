The woman, later identified as Yan Feng, is immobilized by Xu Xiaoyan's Starlight Chains, with further threats posed by Tang Wulin's Blue Silver Grass vines, Ye Xinglan's Star God Sword, and Xie Xie's Light Dragon Dagger. However, she retaliates with a powerful phoenix cry and an explosive release of soul power, expanding the fire gourd and launching a fiery blast that repels the group. Donning a dark red armor with a phoenix helmet, Yan Feng's power significantly increases, revealing her Battle Armor. Recognizing her One-word Battle Armor, Tang Wulin identifies it as a complex enhancement that boosts her strength from a five-ringed to a seven-ringed cultivation level. Misinterpreting their intentions as hostile due to the perceived threat from the Star God Sword and Light Dragon Dagger, Yan Feng becomes enraged. Wu Changkong informs the group that overcoming Yan Feng is crucial for their passage through the city. Despite the odds, Tang Wulin, acknowledging the challenge of confronting a Soul Sage at the seventh rank equipped with full one-word Battle Armor, readies himself for battle, activating his own abilities and Battle Armor gauntlet to face Yan Feng.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 437, titled \"Hit A Brick Wall,\" Tang Wulin and his team confront a powerful adversary, Yan Feng, who wields a fire gourd capable of resisting their Blue Silver Golden Light Array. After being immobilized by Xu Xiaoyan's Starlight Chains, Yan Feng faces additional threats from Tang Wulin's Blue Silver Grass, Ye Xinglan's Star God Sword, and Xie Xie's Light Dragon Dagger. She retaliates with a phoenix cry and an explosive release of soul power, expanding her fire gourd and launching a fiery blast that repels the group. Revealing her Battle Armor, Yan Feng dons a dark red armor with a phoenix helmet, increasing her power significantly, boosting her strength from a five-ringed to a seven-ringed cultivation level. Misinterpreting the group's intentions as hostile, Yan Feng becomes enraged. Wu Changkong informs the group that overcoming Yan Feng is crucial for their passage through the city. Acknowledging the challenge, Tang Wulin prepares for battle, activating his abilities and Battle Armor gauntlet. Yan Feng is shocked by Tang Wulin's emergence of Battle Armor, suspecting he may possess a two-word Battle Armor, an extraordinary feat for his age. Tang Wulin's team swiftly supports him, with Xu Lizhi providing nourishment through special buns. Consuming the buns immediately, Tang Wulin aims for a quick victory, understanding the power of a complete one-word Battle Armor set in recovering soul power. With a powerful leap, he charges forward, his Golden Dragon King aura surging, using his Golden Dragon Claw to confront the enemy's flames head-on. Stimulated by the Bloodlust Red Bean Bun, his powers reach their peak, revealing golden scales on his skin, hinting at potential dual martial souls, further surprising Yan Feng.",
