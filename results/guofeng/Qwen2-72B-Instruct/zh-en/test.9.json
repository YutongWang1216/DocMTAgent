However, Song Fu and his companions deny involvement, explaining they were gathered together when the incident occurred. Initially suspecting Miao Yi's group, they realize Miao Yi has no motive to damage his own property as the new Cave Lord. Acknowledging the gravity of the situation, Song Fu asserts their innocence, revealing that the Eastcalm City laborers had not been assigned yet, necessitating their departure for meals.

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 70, Part 8 of \"Master Donglai,\" tension escalates as Song Fu and his group witness the collapse of Donglai Cave's mountain gate, a stone archway inscribed with its name, which crumbles unexpectedly, leaving all present stunned. Upon arrival, Miao Yi, the new Cave Lord, suspects foul play and confronts Song Fu, accusing him of orchestrating this humiliation. However, Song Fu and his companions vehemently deny any involvement, stating they were all gathered together when the incident occurred. Miao Yi initially considers the possibility that Song Fu might be responsible but dismisses it, recognizing that damaging his own property would serve no purpose. Song Fu emphasizes their innocence, noting that the Eastcalm City laborers had not been allocated tasks and were about to depart for meals. Prince Fa Wang and others confirm this, supporting Song Fu's claim. Despite this, Miao Yi remains skeptical, insisting that the archway's fall could not have been due to natural causes.\n\nIn an attempt to clear their names, Song Fu swears an oath to Miao Yi, declaring the Bluejade Sect's non-involvement in the cave's troubles. Sensing potential external threats, Miao Yi orders everyone to disperse and search the area, a command swiftly executed by Yan Xiu and two others. Amid the heightened tension, Miao Yi specifically addresses Song Fu, demanding he also participates in the search unless he has foreknowledge of the events. To prove their innocence, Song Fu instructs his men to follow the Cave Lord's directive. Miao Yi then takes Song Fu aside, leading him away as the rest scatter to conduct their search.\n\nSuddenly, a mysterious figure, the refined Old Bai, appears at the site of the fallen archway, contemplating the event and Miao Yi's strategic response. He expresses approval of Miao Yi's leadership, suggesting a shift from doubt to confidence in his abilities. After making his observations, Old Bai vanishes without a trace. Meanwhile, inside the Donglai Grand Hall, Song Fu waits anxiously for Miao Yi's instructions, while Miao Yi remains silent, deep in thought. The atmosphere grows heavy as both men ponder their next steps. Outside, Black Coal senses an odd presence and reacts audibly, breaking the silence. Unable to withstand the quiet any longer, Song Fu directly inquires about the reason for Miao Yi's summoning, seeking clarity on their situation.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 70, Part 8 of \"Master Donglai,\" tensions soar as Song Fu and his group witness the unexpected collapse of Donglai Cave's mountain gate, a significant stone archway, which leaves all present stunned and leads to immediate suspicion by the new Cave Lord, Miao Yi, who accuses Song Fu of orchestrating the humiliating event. Despite vehement denials by Song Fu and his companions, citing their collective presence during the incident and support from Prince Fa Wang and others, Miao Yi remains doubtful, believing the fall couldn't have been natural. To clear their names, Song Fu swears an oath regarding the Bluejade Sect's innocence and agrees to join the search for clues under Miao Yi's command. Amid the heightened tension, a mysterious figure, Old Bai, briefly appears, approving Miao Yi's leadership before vanishing. Inside the Donglai Grand Hall, Song Fu awaits further instructions from Miao Yi, who questions Song Fu's loyalty for temporarily leaving his post to find food. The situation rapidly deteriorates as Miao Yi's subordinates, Yan Xiu, Shan Biaoyi, and Qiu Shaqun, report no outsiders involved, leading Miao Yi to reveal Song Fu as the suspect. Trapped and attacked, Song Fu is ultimately overwhelmed and mortally wounded by Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaqun, marking a dramatic turn in events.",
