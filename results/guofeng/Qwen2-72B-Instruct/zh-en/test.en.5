Chapter 369: Out of Danger
The situation was one-sided, both sides were firing at full capacity, and the entire sea was filled with smoke and gunfire.
Bai Ye's high-speed magnetic wave scanner gun fired again, shattering another aircraft. This firearm was indeed handy, and he was getting quite addicted to using it. Xiaonai commanded with ease, and the First Terrorist Organization's air force formed an indestructible offensive and defensive team, beginning their final round of intense attacks.
When Nicolay saw that the situation was turning sour, he couldn't care less about hierarchy anymore, his voice rising. "Master, let's retreat. If we continue fighting like this, we'll be completely annihilated."
Louis clenched his fists tightly, his face dark and brooding, his body emanating a strong aura of malevolence. He, too, could see the current situation clearly.
But he was extremely unwilling to back down, having been forced to retreat just when victory seemed within reach. He had nearly recaptured them, only for everything to fall apart at the last moment—it was truly infuriating.
The man's emerald green eyes flashed with a murderous intent, which then vanished back into the depths of his somber and melancholic gaze. He nodded at Nicolay, who immediately ordered the cover for their retreat.
Louis stared coldly at the two figures drifting above the sea, letting out a derisive snort. This time, they were lucky, but he wouldn't let it rest just like that.
"Honey, they're retreating. Should we pursue them?" Bai Ye chuckled softly, holding the magnetic wave scanner gun with an affection that mirrored cradling a child, a faint and perilous smile tugging at the corners of his lips.
Xiaonai also smiled elegantly, ordering the cessation of the attack. His pitch-black eyes were calm and tranquil as he slowly said, "No pursuit. It would be too much of a pity to let him die just like that. The game of cat and mouse has only just begun."
This round of the game has already changed the course of events.
Louis, he shouldn't have, under any circumstances, provoked him. For Nono's death, he must find someone to pay with their life, or else he would never be able to swallow this humiliation.
When the game begins is up to Louis, but...
Xiaonai's smile was cold and penetrating, his demeanor commanding. When it ends, that's up to him.
Bai Ye smiled, sweeping his sleeve in a suave gesture. "Deal, no pursuit. We have the resources to play along with him. Perhaps before they even make a move, someone will be eager to deal with Louis."
Xiaonai watched in the direction they had fled, a cold sneer playing on his lips in silence.
"Chu Li, it's over. No need for backup. Let's head back immediately."
Bai Ye hung up with Chu Li and then ordered his subordinates to turn around and head back to Rome.
Black Hawk and the others used all their might to drag Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya back up. They were all aware that Cheng Anya had a virus, so they had taken precautions long ago. Ye Sanshao also warned them that he had a virus too, causing Black Hawk and the others to be even more cautious.
Ye Sanshao lay there, panting heavily, and couldn't help kicking Miss Cheng. "Little Anya, you really need to lose some weight; you're as heavy as a dead weight."
His entire shoulder was somewhat numb, as he had been swimming in the seawater for a long time, depleting a significant amount of his energy. Towing Cheng Anya around like this was truly taking a toll on his arms.
He almost didn't catch her, and the thought of dropping her into the sea still sent shivers down his spine.
Black Hawk and the others cheered at their safe return, some passing towels, others pouring hot water, all bustling about with activity. Someone even took the opportunity to jest about how Ye Sanshao had been faring during these days.
The atmosphere on the plane was lively, and when men gathered, there was always an air of camaraderie.
Cheng Anya used the towel handed over by Black Hawk to wipe her hair, then wrapped herself in a blanket to warm up her chilled body, tuning out his words. Finally feeling safe, she sneezed and couldn't help but pull the blanket tighter around herself.
Black Hawk chuckled and said, "Third Young Master, if Madam gets any thinner, you'll be complaining about her looking like a bag of bones."
"I'm already complaining about it now."
Ye Sanshao also got up, drying the seawater off his body, "It's precisely because she's all bones that she's this heavy."
Cheng Anya continued to uphold the virtue of silence being golden. Black Hawk found two sets of clothes for them to change into; since they were men's clothing, they looked comically oversized on Miss Cheng, so she simply wrapped herself up in the blanket.
As soon as she changed into her new clothes, Black Hawk informed her that Ningning wanted to speak with her.
Cheng Anya grabbed the microphone excitedly, "Honey, it's Mommy here."
"Hi, Mommy, have you missed your baby?"
Xiaonai sat on the sofa, chatting with Cheng Anya with a smile on his face, having missed his mother's voice dearly after such a long time.
"Not at all."
Cheng Anya snorted coldly, her tone turning fierce, "You're really hopeless, taking so long to find Mommy. You deserve a spanking."
Ningning, thinking of the promise, felt a pang in his heart, then smiled, "Alright, my treasure, you can hit me as much as you want when we get back to Rome. I've missed Mommy so much; you've been too neglectful of me, Mommy—I look down on you."
"Counter-despise."
Cheng Anya laughed, asking worriedly, "Aren't you hurt at all?"
"No, I'm perfectly fine, nothing at all happened, don't worry about me," Ningning said with a smile. "Mommy, the plane is about to land, I'll talk to you later."
"Okay."
Xiaonai disconnected the communicator, and Cheng Anya sipped hot water to warm herself up. Ye Sanshao had been eagerly looking forward to chatting with his son for a moment, but before he could, the call was hung up, leaving him deeply disgruntled. His eyes accused Cheng Anya as he looked at her.
Miss Cheng calmly ignored him, and Black Hawk chuckled, "Third Young Master, the plane is about to land; you'll be seeing Little Master soon."
Feeling completely ignored, Ye Sanshao couldn't resist giving Miss Cheng a pinch. "Heartless little thing."
"Spiteful little thing."
Cheng Anya laughed and scolded him, handing him the hot water. Ye Sanshao, using Miss Cheng's cup, drank all the remaining hot water. At this moment, if they had a bit of alcohol to warm themselves up, it would be even more delightful.
The plane landed swiftly, all descending within the castle grounds, where Chu Li, Ye Wei, Eleven, and others awaited. Upon seeing Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya safe and sound, everyone collectively exhaled in relief.
"Third Brother, Third Sister-in-law, you two sure are in a sorry state..."
Ye Wei laughed until her branches trembled, "Third Brother, I should have taken a photo for keepsake."
"Stinky brat."
Ye Sanshao chuckled in relief, knowing that Weiwei, Eleven, and Xiaonai were all safe, he could finally put his heart at ease.
After all this effort, how could anything go wrong again?
Xiaonai eagerly reached out to hug Cheng Anya but was sternly halted by her command. It then dawned on him that his mother carried a virus, something Black Hawk had already informed him about. As he looked at his parents' clasped hands, his heart sank slightly.
"Daddy, Mommy, you both... Bai Ye, quickly check on them."
Xiaonai's first instinct was to seek out Bai Ye, a genius doctor whose skills could conquer any ailment.
"Got it, got it, don't worry."
Bai Ye chuckled.
"Virus?"
A handsome guy with blond hair and blue eyes blinked. "Little White, isn't this not your forte?"
Little White?
Bai Ye twisted his wrist, smiling charmingly and gently, "Jason, why don't you try calling me Little White one more time?"
"Damn it, what's wrong with me calling you Little White? You guys even call Black Jack 'Little Iron'."
Known as the Firebreather, Jason erupted on the spot, resembling a golden-maned lion king, yet still strikingly handsome to the point of provoking envy in both mortals and gods.
Especially those sky-blue eyes, as dazzling as sapphires.
When enraged, he exudes a quaking aura, like a volcanic eruption, radiating an overtly domineering presence.
Beside them, Black Jack was a young man in his twenties, strikingly handsome with delicate features. As a Sino-British mixed-race individual, his facial traits combined the mystique of Eastern heritage with the depth of Western lineage. Possessing a pair of gray-blue eyes that often appeared misty and dreamlike, giving off an illusion of deep affection, closer inspection would reveal his extraordinary perceptiveness and a hidden reserve of restrained power.
The two leaders of the First Terrorist Organization were both young, with vastly different personalities, yet each exuded a commanding presence, radiating an air of dominion over all—a sense that only intensified with all three paramount chiefs present.
This row presented a striking visual impact.
"Jason, you really need some fixing up."
Eleven grunted, "What a terrible choice of name, calling him Little White, Little White, give him a beating."
Ye Wei glanced at them and shook her head. "Third Brother, Third Sister-in-Law, ignore them. You two should soak in a hot bath instead, and get checked later to avoid falling ill."
She summoned a maid to take Ye Chen and Cheng Anya downstairs to freshen up; although Xiaonai desperately wanted to follow, he remained behind, as Bai Ye feigned a move to punch someone—prompting Xiaonai to hastily grab onto his sleeve.
"Bai Ye, do you have a way to save Daddy and Mommy?"
The child's eyes shone brightly, like two black grapes set against his fair, tender skin, brimming with anticipation—as if a mere shake of Bai Ye's head would dim the gleam within them.
Jason scooped Xiaonai into his arms, brimming with confidence. "Honey, don't worry. Little White can save even the dead, let alone living people. You're fretting over nothing. When you have time, come over and help me blast through the Mafia's defenses."
"Who just doubted Bai Ye's medical skills?"
Black Jack expressed his skepticism, but as Jason lunged at him with a palm strike, he nimbly dodged it.
Xiaonai, held by the tall man, felt unusually conflicted, and kicked Jason. "Put me down."
"I wish I had a son like you, Ningning. How about becoming my son? I've been eyeing you for a long time." Jason's azure eyes sparkled with intense fervor, as if Xiaonai was a succulent piece of meat ripe for the taking.
Everyone, "..."
Bai Ye said with a smile, "Jason, let your mother teach you more Chinese. Don't always say that the superior officer doesn't know how to use words; you're not much better yourself."
"Jason, the Commander and I aren't on the same level, you know?"
Jason was far from pleased that someone had linked him with the Commander; officials and bandits did not belong in the same family—a matter of principle.
Xiaonai wriggled a bit, and Jason put him down, whereupon Xiaonai asked, "Bai Ye..."
"Ningning, I can only be sure after I examine them. Don't worry just yet," Bai Ye said, ruffling Xiaonai's hair. "I promise I'll do everything I can."
Having just lost Nono and with no assurance of his parents' safety, Xiaonai, despite his composure, could not help but feel unsettled; he could not bear to lose them again. Bai Ye fully understood his state of mind.
"Don't worry too much." Bai Ye said.
Ye Wei said, "It's settled, leave it to Bai Ye. There's no problem in this world that can't be solved. Since Louis was able to develop the virus, there must be an antidote; it can't be unsolvable. If Bai Ye can't resolve it, we'll take down his signboard."
Chu Li smiled. "I agree."
"Little White, do you have a signboard?"
Jason was deeply puzzled; he had never known what signboard he had.
Eleven really wanted to punch him flat.
"Speaking of which, why didn't the two of you catch Louis and bring him back?"
Black Jack asked, "If this guy were dead, we would have had peace of mind sooner."
Jason had long wanted to take him down; lately, the Mafia had been provoking everywhere, yet this guy still had the leisure to indulge in romantic affairs despite his headquarters being bombed, truly showing his incompetence.
"Louis isn't in a rush," Xiaonai said slowly, a dangerous curve appearing on his face, his pitch-black eyes gleaming with calculating light. "Winning without fighting is the highest form of victory. His personal grudge against us is one thing, but the turf war between the Mafia and the terrorist organizations is another matter entirely.
Eliminating the Mafia will undoubtedly require a substantial investment of resources and finances.
After this incident, his position within the Mafia is precarious. I've always suspected that there's a hidden force within the Mafia operating in the shadows, unseen by us. Otherwise, they wouldn't have allowed Louis to engage in such self-destructive actions without intervening. Given this, we'll let Louis lead the way for us, exposing this covert power, so we can annihilate it in one fell swoop.
Cunning...
This was the unanimous thought of everyone present.
Although they knew he was consistently devious and cunning, his young age inevitably led everyone to indulge him excessively, a tendency further exacerbated by his cherubic appearance, which often caused others to overlook his true nature.
"Scheming!"
Jason gave a thumbs up; he was always a man of action, not one to overthink like others, but most of the time, he would listen to Black Jack's and Chu Li's plans.
When it comes to Xiaonai's plans, he has always been one to follow instructions and strategies diligently.
A staunch man of action backed by a formidable think tank is indeed a terrifying force.
"Ningning's method has my approval," Chu Li said, consistently aligning with Bai Ye's thoughts, "It ensures lasting peace, preventing anyone from overestimating their capabilities and constantly provoking us."
"You've never contradicted Ningning, have you? You're just colluding with each other, making a fine pair of scoundrels."
Black Jack chuckled, "But this time, we should indeed teach the Mafia a lesson, ensuring they steer clear of us for the next fifty years."
Bai Ye nodded, having no objections; his priority was to find a cure for the virus affecting Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya, that was the crucial matter at hand. Everything else could be left to Chu Li.
Ye Wei and Eleven exchanged a glance. Another force at play, perhaps?
A single, identical face surfaced in their minds, could it be Mo Ye and Mo Jue?
Within the Mafia, only they could possess the necessary influence and remain enigmatic. Besides them, she couldn't think of anyone else with the audacity to do such a thing. They were men who should naturally surpass Louis in authority, and it made no sense for them to follow his orders.
Everyone moved to the living room, while Xiaonai went to look for Cheng Anya. Coincidentally, she had just finished her bath and enjoyed a cup of hot tea, leaving her body warm and her cheeks flushed with a rosy pink hue. She was lying in bed, thoughtfully examining her fingers.
"Mommy..."
Xiaonai pushed the door open and approached with a cheerful smile.
Cheng Anya snapped back to reality, squinting her eyes as she praised him, "Honey, you've really got style."
This getup, damn, it exudes such presence; there's not a hint of a child's innocence left, he's turned into a downright dangerous character.
"Thanks for the compliment, Mommy."
"Stay back, sit farther away, I'm afraid I might not be able to resist punching you."
Cheng Anya pointed to the sofa opposite her, "Go sit over there."
Xiaonai gave Cheng Anya a resentful glare. "Mommy, you're嫌弃me." 
"Correct."
Cheng Anya smiled, glancing at Xiaonai. She felt that something about the child had subtly changed, even though he appeared no different from before. A mother knows her child best; no matter how well concealed, she could sense any transformation in him.
"Mommy, why are you looking at me like that? Do you think your little treasure is handsome?"
Xiaonai playfully blinked his eyes, looking utterly adorable.
Cheng Anya regarded him with a half-smile, "You've certainly picked up about eighty to ninety percent of your father's narcissism. Tell me honestly, have you been alright lately? Has anyone bullied you?"
Xiaonai shook his head. "No."
"Nonsense, Louis showed me photos where he was clearly beaten until he was covered in blood."
Cheng Anya clearly didn't believe him, gritting her teeth, "I wouldn't feel avenged even if he were hacked to pieces a thousand times."
Recalling all that she had endured, Cheng Anya harbored an intense hatred for Louis.
Her radiant face now bore a layer of icy apprehension, and as she recalled what Xiaonai had once endured, she felt an ominous foreboding.
"Mommy, I'm really fine; it's mostly something he spliced together."
Xiaonai smiled gracefully, rolling up his sleeves to reveal a segment of his fair, tender arm. "See, not a single scar."
The bullet wound on his arm was nearly healed, and soon, he wasn't the least bit afraid of Cheng Anya discovering it.
And those whip scars he once bore were all courtesy of Nono; since it was Nono who inflicted them, he didn't feel wronged but instead somewhat missed the pain of being beaten by her back then.
If Nono could live on, he would willingly endure being beaten by her for the rest of his life this way.
"Ningning, are you really alright?"
Cheng Anya's brows furrowed as she did not miss the fleeting pain that crossed her son's eyes.
Xiaonai nodded. "I'm really fine, Mommy. It's you and Daddy who have problems. Uncle Black Hawk said you have a virus on you, how did Daddy get infected too?"
Cheng Anya blushed again as she recalled Ye Sanshao's hormonal overload; she didn't even have the desire to elaborate. "Let's not talk about it. I jumped out of a plane once in the desert and another time at sea. How could there not have been contact?"
Miss Cheng spoke with remarkable calmness, and Xiaonai had no reason to doubt her.
"Mommy, don't worry, Bai Ye is so skilled in medicine, he will surely find a way to save you both."
