Chapter 210: Matters Between the Supervisor and the Empress Dowager - Part 64
For a moment, Xiaomo's heart was stirred, and she became profoundly sorrowful.
The Supervisor is... unable to make a move, dare not act.
Once his body starts moving, his mind will start working too; how could he, being so smart, not know that Bai Weiwei has already died.
He was unwilling to admit it, nor dared he delve deeper into his thoughts; he could only force himself to remain seated, convincing himself that Bai Weiwei was merely asleep and would wake up.
Xiaomo felt that only when Bai Weiwei's body began to decompose would the Supervisor truly regain his senses, realizing that the person whose hand he was holding had been dead for quite some time.
Yet strangely, Bai Weiwei's corpse showed no signs of change whatsoever.
Even her pale complexion had improved considerably, and although her body was cold, it was no different than if she were merely asleep.
Not a single characteristic of a corpse had appeared.
Muyan Jun watched over her, his eyes growing increasingly bright.
The old quack of a divine doctor was finally escorted over. As he popped heart pills into his mouth, he said, "I reckon I've lost more than half my life over this."
Muyan Jun hadn't slept for five days, and anyone could see just how exhausted his body was.
But his entire being was abnormally lucid, so清醒that it was frightening and abnormal. 
"Since I gave her the medicine, she's been sleeping like this. I thought you should come take a look to see when she'll wake up?"
The old man sighed before walking over to the bedside to take Bai Weiwei's pulse.
"In fact, this phenomenon is extremely rare. There's no need for treatment, but there is one particularly important thing that needs to be done..."
Muyanjun listened attentively, like a good student, with a fire burning in his eyes.
The old man's voice dropped, "It means I have to treat another person again..."
Muyanjun leaned forward, not wanting to miss a word he said.
The old man's movements were as quick as lightning, and in an instant, he inserted a needle into his neck.
Muyanjun's eyes suddenly widened, and his hand was already striking towards the top of the old man's head.
Xiaomo's hand shot out horizontally, grasping Muyan Jun's attack.
With the ebb and flow of events, Muyan Jun could no longer hold on and succumbed to a faint, falling into unconsciousness.
The old man patted his own head, "I was close to dying, but then again, I don't have much time left. It'll be good if he doesn't go crazy when he wakes up."
Bai Weiwei cannot be saved.
Muyan Jun's condition was simply heart-wrenching, affecting his spirit and causing issues throughout his internal organs.
Not eating, not sleeping, not thinking, not moving, he was no different from a living dead man, and if he persisted for two more days, he would likely perish alongside Bai Weiwei.
Xiaomo looked at the old quack, "You're protecting our Supervisor's life; if you fail to protect him this time, I'll kill you myself."
After saying this, she turned around and walked out, heading to the place where they were to receive their punishment, going to endure it silently.
The old man sighed, "No wonder my master used to say, selling sweet potatoes would be better than being a divine doctor. Everyone treats me like a god, but even a god can't keep someone alive who wants to die."
Muyan Jun had barely slept for two hours before his eyes snapped open.
He was startled, a rare look of panic crossing his eyes, only to realize that he was unable to move.
The old man noticed that he had woken up. "I'm acupuncture-ing you, your mind and spirit are both in decline, but I'm nurturing them; otherwise, you'd be paying a visit to King Yan."
Muyan Jun's eyes darkened, his face pale and haggard, yet brimming with malevolence, enough to send shivers down one's spine upon sight.
The old man inserted another needle into him, "I didn't really want to save you, considering how wicked someone like you can be; who knows what chaos you might unleash upon revival."
Muyan Jun's voice was soft yet eerie, "Let me go."
The old man shook his head, "That won't do. Since I can't revive the one closest to your heart, saving you could be considered compensation."
Muyan Jun suddenly erupted into a piercing laugh, "You can never make amends, how could you possibly compensate? Even if you save every single person in this world, it wouldn't make up for a single strand of her hair."
