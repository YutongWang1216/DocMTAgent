Chapter 805: The Last Story
"In the East Campus?"
Zhou Tu clearly hesitated for a moment. Both seniors and teachers had warned the freshmen not to approach the East Campus; they didn't specify the reason, but from their tone of voice, it was clear that the East Campus was very dangerous.
"You have a profound misunderstanding about the East Campus. It's actually much the same as here, except that the management styles of the two campuses are completely different. They live in genuine terror, while you live in false happiness."
Chen Ge looked into Zhou Tu's eyes: "Compared to you, they are actually closer to hope, because at least they know who they are and how to find liberation."
Chen Ge did not deceive Zhou Tu; whether it was the students from the East Campus or the West Campus, they were all trapped within this school.
The students of the West Campus have had their memories altered, repeating a life crafted by the mastermind behind the scenes, whereas the students of the East Campus at least still know to search for scapegoats and devise ways to escape.
"Are the students from the East Campus closer to hope?"
"But I've heard that only the unwanted trash from the West Campus is sent there."
Zhou Tu was already swayed, but he still felt somewhat uneasy in his heart.
"No matter what the criteria are, any school that treats its students like trash is certainly a trash school itself."
Chen Ge pointed at the high wall between the two campuses: "Do you know why that wall exists?"
"Why?"
"Because the school fears losing control, they attempt to reshape humanity through various means, but they've forgotten that human nature is the most complex thing in this world."
"The deed has been done, no matter how one tries to forget, the wound will always leave a scar on the heart."
"Remembering nothing doesn't mean that things didn't exist, which is why certain plans of this school are destined to fail."
Chen Ge spoke words that some club members couldn't understand; they didn't know why Chen Ge said such things, yet they felt there seemed to be some truth in what he was saying.
Children are naturally curious, and Chen Ge kept revealing the truth about this school to them, eventually piquing the interest of the club members.
"Shall we go over there now?"
"To be honest, I really don't believe that there would be my dream art studio in the East Campus," Zhou Tu said softly.
"It's not the right time yet."
Chen Ge glanced back at the shadow; the dark figure in dormitory 413 was still asleep, but his body had undergone significant changes.
If one looked closely, they would notice that Chen Ge's shadow was unlike anyone else's, pitch-black like ink, as if all light that touched it was devoured whole.
It seemed to have grown much stronger.
The dark figure's potential is enormous, which is good news for Chen Ge; once he awakens, Chen Ge will lead the students back to the East Campus to once again hunt down solitary malevolent spirits.
By doing so, he could enhance his own strength, and secondly, he could stir up the stagnant waters of the school, providing cover for the other "murderer" hidden within the academy.
"I am still in the phase of building my strength; before the master of the school discovers this little bug, I need to prepare as many trump cards as possible for myself."
Chen Ge turned to look at Wang Yicheng; he had learned the stories of the other three club members, leaving only this limping boy who was the first to join the club: "Our next destination is Wang Yicheng's dormitory."
"To my dormitory?"
Wang Yicheng reacted strangely upon hearing this, waving his hands repeatedly. "Forget it, there's nothing interesting about the dormitory where I live."
"When you said that, your voice was higher than usual, your speech sped up, and your eyes wandered. You really aren't good at lying, kid."
Chen Ge gently put his arm around Wang Yicheng's shoulder. "Why don't you want us to come over?"
"What are you worried we might see?"
"I..."
Wang Yicheng thought for a long time, unsure how to respond, and finally looked away, saying, "Never mind, let's just go there directly."
"Alright."
Wang Yicheng lived in Room 413 of the West Campus dormitory, while Lin Sisi lived in Room 413 of the East Campus dormitory.
The room numbers were identical, but in Room 413 of the West Campus dormitory, all beds except Bed No.4 were occupied by students, whereas in the East Campus, it was the opposite—only Bed No.4 was occupied, the rest were empty.
"Keep the secrets of our club to ourselves and try to keep a low profile. There are teachers in this school like me, but there are also those who aren't as easy to talk to."
Chen Ge remained vigilant at all times; the commotion they had caused in the laboratory building was too loud—the school authorities might have already begun their investigation.
"The time left for me is limited; after visiting Room 413, I need to lay low for a while."
The men's dormitory buildings in the West Campus totaled four, housing several times more students than the East Campus. Lights were still on, marking the peak liveliness of the boys' dormitories, with sounds of washing, plastic basins clattering to the floor, and conversations—all distinctly audible even from downstairs.
"This building is similar to the one in the East Campus."
Chen Ge acted naturally, following the four students as they all entered the first building together.
The door to the dorm supervisor's small living quarters was tightly shut, but the glass window was open, revealing an aunt in her fifties humming a tune inside, seemingly in a good mood.
A notice was taped next to the small window, stating that the use of high-power electrical appliances by students in the dormitory was strictly prohibited, as was cooking in the dorm rooms.
"I recall that the notice on the East Campus dormitory building stated something along the lines of—recent serious incidents have occurred, and students are forbidden to go out after lights out."
Separated by just one wall, it's almost like two entirely different worlds, akin to being on opposite sides of the "door."
Walking down the corridor, Chen Ge and several club members arrived at the door of dormitory 413.
"This dormitory is no different from the others."
Wang Yicheng opened the door, and upon entering the room, the other roommates acted as if he didn't exist, each engrossed in their own activities, with not a single person addressing him.
As Wang Yicheng took a few steps inside, the boy sleeping in the bed next to the door suddenly pulled back the mosquito net and glared at him. "How many times have I told you?"
"Close the door behind you when you come in, are your legs crippled, or are your ears not working either?"
The boy's words were harsh, and for some inexplicable reason, he seemed to really dislike Wang Yicheng.
"He doesn't close the door because someone else is coming in right after him. If you want an apology, the rest of us can apologize on his behalf, but we're just not sure what form of apology you require?"
Chen Ge gripped the doorknob and entered the room, casting a glance at the others inside the dormitory.
The mosquito-net boy wilted at the sight of Chen Ge, remaining silent as he sullenly drew the mosquito net closed again.
"Teacher Bai, this is Bed No.4, and since no one lives here, we've been using it to store our luggage."
Wang Yicheng pointed to Bed No.4, atop which lay several suitcases. In this dormitory, only his luggage was stored beneath his own bed; everyone else had tossed their miscellaneous items and luggage onto Bed No.4.
Chen Ge was very familiar with Bed No.4; he himself had lain on the bed numbered four in the East Campus.
Walking up to Bed No.4, although the bed was unoccupied, it was dressed with quilts and sheets; however, these bedding items were now soiled by the luggage and assorted clutter.
