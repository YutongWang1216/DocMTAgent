        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 455 titled \"Reversal 3,\" Lin Sheng seeks assistance from a fellow Daoist to experience aura fluctuations, aiming to locate additional fragments promptly. Initially planning to subdue more malevolent spirits for pure soul power, the fortuitous encounter prompts a shift towards expedited acquisition. Guided by the Head Acolyte, they stand before a malevolent spirit gate, initiating a ritual by simultaneously touching its frame. With eyes closed, the Head Acolyte constructs a spatial baseplate using paranormal abilities, setting it as a coordinate reference. Following the gate's ritual fluctuations, both their perceptual consciousnesses are propelled outward. The Head Acolyte explains that while standard teleportation gates offer point-to-point transmission, explorations of spatial mysteries involve transforming this into point-to-multipoint travel through minor adjustments to the teleportation baseplate. This method allows the malevolent spirit gate to transmit their consciousness to various potential locations of similar target spaces, akin to an energy-based gamble where success hinges on luck. Lin Sheng finds the process genuinely random, as his perception, upon entering the gate, becomes instantly engulfed by internal ritual fluctuations and thrust outward.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 455, titled \"Reversal 3,\" Lin Sheng collaborates with a fellow Daoist to expedite the search for additional Yin-to-Evil Wheel fragments, leveraging aura fluctuations for prompt location. Initially planning to subdue more malevolent spirits for pure soul power, Lin Sheng is led by the Head Acolyte to a malevolent spirit gate for a ritual that involves touching its frame simultaneously. Closing their eyes, the Head Acolyte uses paranormal abilities to construct a spatial baseplate, acting as a coordinate reference. As they follow the gate's ritual fluctuations, their perceptual consciousnesses are propelled outward, transforming standard teleportation into point-to-multipoint travel. This method, akin to an energy-based gamble, allows their consciousness to be transmitted to various potential locations of similar target spaces, guided by luck.\n\nDuring the consciousness transmission, Lin Sheng experiences an extraordinary division of his perceptual awareness into over ten segments, each sensing distinct spatial atmospheres. His powerful spirit soul enables him to remember the coordinates of every space encountered by these fragments, despite the complexity. Under the Head Acolyte's guidance, Lin Sheng learns to create markers to determine coordinate codes, a task simplified by his superior cognitive abilities. After ten minutes of effort, his consciousness dissipates, and upon reopening his eyes, he presents a unique spatial mystery coordinate to the Head Acolyte and others, revealing a space related to the Yin-to-Evil Wheel fragment he possesses. This feat impresses the group, given the Head Acolyte took over half a month for similar recordings during his initial attempts. Lin Sheng proceeds to set up a teleportation portal effortlessly, expressing his intention to visit the discovered location.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 455, titled \"Reversal 3,\" Lin Sheng teams up with a fellow Daoist to accelerate the search for Yin-to-Evil Wheel fragments using aura fluctuations to pinpoint their locations swiftly. Initially intending to capture more malevolent spirits for pure soul power, Lin Sheng and the Head Acolyte perform a ritual involving touching a malevolent spirit gate simultaneously. By closing their eyes, the Head Acolyte employs paranormal abilities to create a spatial baseplate serving as a coordinate reference. As they follow the ritual's fluctuations, their perceptual consciousnesses are thrust outwards, converting regular teleportation into point-to-multipoint travel. This energy-based method, akin to gambling, sends their consciousness to various potential locations of similar target spaces, guided by fortune.\n\nDuring this process, Lin Sheng's perceptual awareness splits into over ten segments, each sensing different spatial atmospheres. His potent spirit soul allows him to retain the coordinates of every space these fragments encounter, despite the intricacy. Under the Head Acolyte's tutelage, Lin Sheng masters the technique of creating markers to decipher coordinate codes, facilitated by his advanced cognitive skills. After ten minutes of endeavor, his consciousness fades, and upon reawakening, he unveils a unique spatial mystery coordinate to the Head Acolyte and the group, exposing a space linked to the Yin-to-Evil Wheel fragment he holds. This achievement astounds the team, considering the Head Acolyte required over half a month for comparable recordings on his first try. Lin Sheng then effortlessly establishes a teleportation portal, declaring his plan to explore the identified location.\n\nHowever, Heavenly Artifice Xia informs Lin Sheng of a critical shift at the Bishaga Islands, signifying a dramatic alteration in circumstances. She discloses that Mi Yue, seemingly disadvantaged, has duped all three major mystic realms. Instead of expecting reinforcements, Mi Yue had already invoked Faludo, sacrificing himself to merge with it. This disclosure momentarily stupefies Lin Sheng, who comprehends that the three mystic realms now confront the amalgamated entity of Mi Yue and Faludo, a formidable union.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 455, titled \"Reversal 3,\" Lin Sheng collaborates with a fellow Daoist, the Head Acolyte, employing aura fluctuations to expedite the search for Yin-to-Evil Wheel fragments through an innovative energy-based method. By performing a ritual that involves simultaneously touching a malevolent spirit gate, they convert regular teleportation into point-to-multipoint travel, sending their perceptual consciousnesses to potential locations of the fragments. Lin Sheng's consciousness divides into over ten segments, each sensing different spatial atmospheres, while his potent spirit soul retains the coordinates of each encountered space. Under the Head Acolyte's guidance, Lin Sheng learns to create markers for deciphering coordinate codes, culminating in the unveiling of a unique spatial mystery coordinate connected to a Yin-to-Evil Wheel fragment within ten minutes—a feat that took the Head Acolyte over half a month on his first attempt. Lin Sheng then opens a teleportation portal to investigate the discovered location.\n\nAmidst this, Heavenly Artifice Xia alerts Lin Sheng to a critical development at the Bishaga Islands, revealing that Mi Yue, previously thought to be at a disadvantage, has merged with Faludo, transforming into a powerful entity that outwits the three major mystic realms. Lin Sheng, initially stunned, understands the new threat posed by the unified Mi Yue and Faludo. In response to Heavenly Artifice Xia's concern about dealing with this formidable alliance, Lin Sheng advises calmness, noting that as long as they remain unthreatened, their growth is irrelevant. However, Heavenly Artifice Xia, drawing from her own experience with a demonic sword, stresses the need for early preparation against such overwhelming power. Acknowledging Heavenly Artifice Xia's unique insight, given her past involvement with a powerful entity, Lin Sheng concurs and commits to taking preventive measures.",
