        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 1303 titled \"As Long As It's You (1),\" tensions rise as the Old Man of the Eastern Palace confronts a group, questioning their actions. The leader informs him that the 'ancestors,' including Pei Yi, are about to arrive, urging the Old Man to remain calm. An Xiaoning, disguised with a mask and wig, steps out of her vehicle upon Pei Yi's arrival, accompanied by Wu Lianzhi. An Xiaoning acknowledges Pei Yi's presence, explaining that her disguise ensures her identity remains unknown to the Eastern Palace members, as it's not the opportune moment for disclosure. Pei Yi, curious about Wu Lianzhi's involvement, inquires about the nature of their association. Addressing the Eastern Palace family, Pei Yi inquires about the reason behind their animosity towards his sister, challenging their audacity to target her.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 1303 titled \"As Long As It's You (1),\" tensions escalate as the Old Man of the Eastern Palace confronts a group, questioning their motives. The leader reveals that the 'ancestors,' including Pei Yi, are approaching, advising the Old Man to maintain composure. An Xiaoning, incognito with a mask and wig, emerges from her car upon Pei Yi's arrival, accompanied by Wu Lianzhi, formerly known as Donggong Lianzhi. An Xiaoning acknowledges Pei Yi while maintaining her anonymity from the Eastern Palace members, deeming it unsuitable to reveal her identity yet. Pei Yi, intrigued by Wu Lianzhi's presence, inquires about their connection. Addressing the Eastern Palace family, Pei Yi challenges their hostility toward his sister, whose existence shocks the family, as they were previously unaware of this sibling. Pei Yi confirms the relationship and confronts the matriarch, who asserts that despite Donggong Lianzhi's actions, he is still part of their family. However, An Xiaoning reveals that Lianzhi is her boyfriend and the father of her unborn child, complicating Pei Yi's plan to take only her away. Undeterred, Pei Yi argues that taking Lianzhi would provide the child with a father. The matriarch resists, fearing loss of control over their grandson. Pei Yi counters, emphasizing Lianzhi's rechristening as Wu Lianzhi, who disowns his ties with the Eastern Palace family due to their assassination attempt on him, An Xiaoning, and his associates. Publicly, Wu Lianzhi declares his name change and disavowal of the Eastern Palace family, demonstrating resolve. The matriarch rebuffs his statement, claiming the family's dominion over him even posthumously. An Xiaoning challenges the matriarch's fixation on punishment, raising concerns about potential repercussions from S Country concerning their attempted murder. Despite the matriarch's claims, Pei Yi and An Xiaoning highlight Wu Lianzhi's autonomy and the impending consequences of the Eastern Palace family's actions.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 1303 titled \"As Long As It's You (1),\" tensions rise as the Old Man of the Eastern Palace faces a group, questioning their intentions. The leader discloses the imminent arrival of the 'ancestors,' including Pei Yi, urging the Old Man to remain calm. An Xiaoning, disguised with a mask and wig, steps out of her car upon Pei Yi's appearance, accompanied by Wu Lianzhi, formerly known as Donggong Lianzhi. An Xiaoning keeps her identity hidden from the Eastern Palace members, deeming it inappropriate to reveal herself at this juncture. Pei Yi, intrigued by Wu Lianzhi's presence, asks about their connection. Addressing the Eastern Palace family, Pei Yi exposes their hostility towards his sister, whose existence comes as a shock, as they were unaware of this relation. Pei Yi validates the familial link and confronts the matriarch, who insists that despite Donggong Lianzhi's transgressions, he remains a part of their family. However, An Xiaoning discloses that Lianzhi is her boyfriend and the father of her unborn child, complicating Pei Yi's strategy to whisk her away alone. Unperturbed, Pei Yi argues that taking Lianzhi would ensure the child has a father. The matriarch opposes, fearing the loss of control over their future grandson. Pei Yi counters, emphasizing Lianzhi's rechristening as Wu Lianzhi and his severance of ties with the Eastern Palace family due to their assassination attempt on him, An Xiaoning, and his allies. Publicly, Wu Lianzhi declares his name change and disassociation from the Eastern Palace family, demonstrating steadfastness. The matriarch rejects his declaration, asserting the family's dominion over him even after death. An Xiaoning challenges the matriarch's focus on punishment, warning about potential repercussions from S Country regarding their attempted murder. Despite the matriarch's assertions, Pei Yi and An Xiaoning underscore Wu Lianzhi's independence and the impending consequences of the Eastern Palace family's actions. In a tense dialogue, Wu Lianzhi disregards fear, confirming his past dealings with An Xiaoning and recognizing her vindictive nature. Pei Yi interjects, stressing the urgency of his time and his aim to depart with two individuals, cautioning the Donggong family against further opposition to avert violence. Though frustrated, the Donggong family concedes, with the matriarch renouncing Wu Lianzhi. Pei Yi unveils a scheme to return to S Country, leading to a negotiation where An Xiaoning seeks to outline the terms of her pact with him. She demands no restrictions and a shortened period for her company, settling on two days rather than half a month. Pei Yi counters with five days, underlining the significance of honoring commitments. An Xiaoning questions the possibility of returning to the country first, but Pei Yi denies her request. Amidst these developments, Pei Yi's determination to take both An Xiaoning and Wu Lianzhi back to S Country sets the scene for further negotiations. An Xiaoning agrees to accompany Pei Yi for five days without constraints, but her wish to return home before the trip's end is denied, setting the stage for the unfolding events in S Country.",
