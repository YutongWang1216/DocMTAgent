Curly, the dog, enjoyed a great day playing outdoors, swimming in the sea, and digging in the sand. Upon departure, he showed reluctance to leave, prompting Nanfeng to reassure him that next time they visit, he would have full access to the area, allowing him to play freely, swim daily, and interact with marine life. Curly was thrilled and spent the car ride dreaming of his future seaside adventures, associating the ocean with a limitless seafood feast. Back at the dormitory for continuing education students, Fangzhao confirmed Curly's enjoyment of the day through questions and the dog's enthusiastic responses.\n\nKey points:\n- House inspection and decision-making process.\n- Curly's outdoor activities and joy.\n- Nanfeng's promise of future seaside freedom for Curly.\n- Curly's association of the ocean with abundant seafood.\n- Confirmation of Curly's happiness upon returning to the dormitory.",

Meanwhile, Curly, the dog, reveled in an extraordinary day filled with outdoor activities, including swimming in the sea and digging in the sand. When it was time to leave, Curly displayed reluctance, but Nanfeng promised him that during their next visit, he would have unrestricted access to the area, enabling him to play, swim, and interact with marine life to his heart's content. This prospect delighted Curly, who spent the journey back to the dormitory for continuing education students envisioning endless seaside adventures and associating the ocean with a bountiful seafood feast. Upon their return, Fangzhao confirmed Curly's blissful experience through his enthusiastic responses. To Curly's surprise, now fluent in switching between languages, Fangzhao presented him with a new learning challenge. Despite Curly's initial retreat, Fangzhao activated the learning machine, revealing a folder containing twenty e-books and corresponding test sets focused on ocean-related subjects like marine environment protection, wildlife, and management. Fangzhao set a condition for Curly to explore the sea: he must complete the reading and achieve perfect scores within fifteen days, prior to their move.",

Back at the dormitory, Fangzhao acknowledged Curly's joy and introduced a new learning challenge, requiring Curly to read twenty e-books and ace tests on marine topics within fifteen days to earn sea exploration privileges. Concerned about Curly's voracious appetite potentially disrupting the marine ecosystem at their new seaside home, Fangzhao planned to teach Curly the importance of responsible eating to preserve the local wildlife. Failure to learn could result in lost privileges and more time with the learning machine.

Nanfeng promised Curly unbridled access to the sea during their next visit, fueling the dog's excitement for upcoming coastal escapades. Upon returning to the dormitory, Fangzhao recognized Curly's bliss and introduced a novel educational challenge: Curly must read twenty e-books and pass exams on marine subjects within fifteen days to gain permission for ocean exploration. Motivated by concerns over Curly's potential impact on the marine environment at their new seaside residence, Fangzhao aimed to instruct the dog on responsible consumption to safeguard the local fauna. Non-compliance would lead to revoked privileges and increased time spent with the learning machine. Simultaneously, Nanfeng arrived to converse about renovation strategies and revealed the online fervor surrounding Will's painting of Curly, titled \"The Neighbor's Dog,\" which garnered significant attention at Will's recent graduation art exhibition.\n\nFollowing the exhibition, Will's artwork, notably \"My Neighbor\" and \"The Neighbor's Dog,\" ignited fervent online debates after being showcased on the school's website. Having accomplished his interim objective of painting Fangzhao, Will portrayed him in an extraterrestrial fashion in \"My Neighbor.\" The most recent creation, \"The Neighbor's Dog,\" has become a viral sensation. Characterized by vivid hues and an enigmatic, majestic style, the painting bears no resemblance to a dog without its title, leaving viewers with a mix of wonder and disquiet. Some liken the emotions it elicits to those stirred by Fangzhao's composition \"Eta,\" indicating it surpasses conventional comprehension. Even uninitiated onlookers experience a shiver upon beholding it. Online responses encompass admiration for Will's creative liberty post-advanced education and conjectures regarding potential childhood trauma involving a dog bite, given the unsettling representation of Fangzhao's pet.",

Promising Curly continued beach access, Fangzhao introduces an educational challenge: Curly must read twenty e-books and pass exams on marine subjects within fifteen days to earn permission for ocean exploration, motivated by environmental concerns at their new seaside home. Failure results in revoked privileges and more time with the learning machine. Meanwhile, Nanfeng discusses renovation plans and reveals the online buzz around Will's painting of Curly, titled \"The Neighbor's Dog,\" which gained attention at Will's graduation art exhibition. Post-exhibition, Will's works, including \"My Neighbor\" and \"The Neighbor's Dog,\" sparked heated online discussions. \"The Neighbor's Dog,\" characterized by vibrant colors and an enigmatic style, leaves viewers feeling a mix of wonder and unease, drawing comparisons to Fangzhao's composition \"Eta\" and exceeding conventional understanding. The painting was sold to a Mu Province collector at a high price, far beyond the Royal Academy of Art's estimate, with some seeing it as an investment in Will's future. This event heightened interest in Will's work, made Curly a trending topic, and prompted Fangzhao to advise Curly to stay indoors temporarily due to unexpected fame.",
