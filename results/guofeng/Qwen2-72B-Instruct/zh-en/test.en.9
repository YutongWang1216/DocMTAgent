Chapter 70: Master Donglai (Part 8)
This was exactly what Song Fu and the others wanted to ask. Having someone beat them to it, they looked at each other, none of them knowing what was going on, and thus couldn't answer.
Miao Yi immediately flew towards the source of the loud noise, with Yan Xiu and the other two quickly following behind.
Song Fu and the others exchanged a glance before following to see what was happening.
The group arrived at the entrance of the mountain gate, and under the moonlight, they saw that the stone archway engraved with the words 'Donglai Cave' was shattered all over the ground, causing everyone to be startled. Someone had actually destroyed the mountain gate of Donglai Cave.
Miao Yi suddenly turned around, his face contorted as he glared at Song Fu and the others, sneering incessantly, "Wonderful!"
"It seems someone couldn't wait to give me a taste of humble pie the moment I arrived today!"
"Great!"
Song Fu and the others were taken aback; they understood the implication of the other party's words, but this matter was definitely not their doing. This was because they had just been sitting together having a small gathering, discussing how to show Miao Yi their strength in the future. They only came out upon hearing an abnormal noise.
The few of them had initially suspected if it was Miao Yi and his group who did it, but seeing Miao Yi’s state, they felt that there was no need for Miao Yi to smash his own mountain gate to show himself who was boss. After all, Miao Yi was the Cave Lord of Donglai Cave, and it would be a humiliating affair if his signboard was destroyed right after taking office.
Such matters definitely needed to be clarified, otherwise, they could not shoulder the responsibility should it be reported up the chain. Song Fu solemnly clasped his fists and said, "Cave Lord, this matter is definitely not the doing of us!"
The others also clasped their fists to assure him, seemingly treating Miao Yi as the Cave Lord with due seriousness for the first time.
"Quibbling!"
Miao Yi stared at Song Fu and barked, "I only appointed you to guard the mountain gate today. How could you not know if someone destroyed the mountain gate?"
"You must have deliberately let them off!"
"This..."
Song Fu was left speechless. He hadn't been here in the first place, but he couldn't say that he hadn't taken the Cave Lord's position seriously, which was why he wasn't there. All he could do was clasp his fists and honestly explain, "Cave Lord, you've just arrived, so you might not know the situation. The Eastcalm City laborers haven't been assigned to us yet. We have to take care of our own meals. In order to eat, I temporarily left for a bit. I didn't expect something like this to happen."
Prince Fa Wang and the others also clasped their fists one after another to confirm, "Cave Lord, we can vouch that Senior Apprentice Brother Song Fu was having a meal with us just now."
Miao Yi pointed at the fallen archway and shouted fiercely, "Did it fall down by itself? Don't you dare tell me that it was blown down by the wind!"
Song Fu felt like a mute eating a bitter herb, unable to speak his grievances. He had no choice but to raise his hand and say, "Cave Lord, I can swear by all the ancestors of the Bluejade Sect that this was not done by us. If even half a word of what I'm saying is false, may I, Song Fu, suffer a terrible fate!"
Miao Yi's gaze flickered as he swept over everyone, speaking in a dark tone, "Could it be that someone came to Donglai Cave to cause trouble?"
Everyone was taken aback, realizing that it was indeed possible. They quickly looked around.
"What are you still waiting for here? Do you want to get your throats slit in your sleep?"
"Haven't you all better scatter and start searching!"
Miao Yi shouted in anger.
Yan Xiu and the other two responded with a fist salute before quickly dispersing into the surrounding forests.
"Hmm?"
Miao Yi snorted heavily through his nostrils, his gaze fixating on Song Fu and the others, seemingly questioning why they hadn't gone to search if it wasn't them, implying whether they knew something.
At this moment, they had to make a statement to prove their innocence. Song Fu immediately turned around and shouted to his men, "Why aren't you following the Cave Lord's orders and going to search!"
Everyone gave a quick bow to Miao Yi and immediately dispersed.
However, Song Fu was stopped by Miao Yi, who called out, "Song Fu, come with me!"
Song Fu hesitated for a moment, saluted in acknowledgement, and fell in behind Miao Yi.
Just after everyone left, a ghostly figure, like a reflection in water, appeared on the spot. It was none other than the striking figure of Old Bai, renowned for his exceptional elegance.
Old Bai, staring at the fallen stone gate archway, shook his head slightly and said with a light smile, "The world is like a game of chess; passionate men cannot rely solely on brute strength!"
"I've always been worried that your nature is too kind-hearted, making you vulnerable to being taken advantage of... A man's bold actions should be guided by cunning; a mere brute cannot ascend to greatness. I'm now much more at ease about your prospects."
With that, the entire figure rippled like a water surface, subtly vanishing without a trace in the undulation.
In the flickering candlelight of the Donglai Grand Hall, Song Fu stood behind Miao Yi, the two forming a line within the hall. Outside, Black Coal had risen to his feet, seemingly sensing something, and let out a loud sneeze.
Miao Yi stared expressionlessly at his own throne, standing with his hands clasped behind his back, facing away from Song Fu in silence.
The atmosphere between the two was somewhat oppressive. After waiting for a moment, Song Fu finally couldn't help but ask, "Cave Lord, what did you summon me for?"
Miao Yi spoke in a grim tone, "Song Fu, do you know your crime?"
A hint of derision played on Song Fu's lips as he glanced at the wine and dishes on the low table nearby, saying coolly, "This matter is certainly not our doing; what crime could Song Fu possibly have committed?"
"That's not what I'm asking!"
Miao Yi suddenly wheeled around, fixing his gaze on him and asking in icy tones, word by word, "I ordered you to guard the mountain gate; why did you leave your post without permission? Do you disregard the commands of your Cave Lord!"
Song Fu thought to himself, What do you think?
It was never in his eyes to begin with.
Of course, he wouldn't say it that way out loud, "Song Fu has already reported to the Cave Lord that I had no choice but to leave temporarily just to get something to eat. I certainly didn't want to see such an incident happen."
Miao Yi asked, "Do you think that after I report this incident, the Manor Lord and the Mountain Lord will believe your explanation?"
Song Fu chuckled and said, "Words can twist like the two sides of a piece of skin. If the Cave Lord insists on framing me, then go right ahead, but don't forget, I too have a mouth to defend myself—I'm not a mute."
Miao Yi sneered, "Seems you're truly unrepentant to the bitter end!"
At these words, Yan Xiu, Shan Biaoyi, and Qiu Shaqun appeared in tandem at the door, stepping inside together and saluting Miao Yi with clasped fists: "Cave Lord, we've found no suspicious individuals as yet."
Miao Yi stated, "The suspect is right before our eyes; how can you say there's no one suspicious to be found!"
Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaqun, seemingly receiving a covert signal, swiftly moved to shut the hall doors.
Hearing this, Song Fu was startled and quickly turned around, only to see the god of death-like Yan Xiu already furiously swinging his pair of hatchets towards him.
Song Fu swiftly drew his sword, a cold glint flashing as it left the scabbard, and he hastily parried the attack with a clanging of metal.
Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaqun also almost instantly emerged, spears at the ready, joining forces to besiege Song Fu.
Yan Xiu and Song Fu were roughly equal in cultivation, their forces evenly matched; with the joint addition of Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaqun, Song Fu's situation suddenly became perilously dire.
"Wretched, shameless wretch!"
"Dare to plot harm..."
Surrounded and unable to break free, Song Fu, who was barely managing to lock swords with Yan Xiu in a desperate struggle, let out a mournful roar that was cut short as two lances, thrusting with relentless force, pierced through his magical defense and brutally plunged into his chest.
Song Fu, eyes wide with exertion, strained to turn and look at Miao Yi, his lips quivering, the rage in his gaze indescribable.
He finally understood that this was a trap—the collapse of the mountain gate archway was not only meant to frame him but also to lure away his fellow sect members, preventing him from joining forces with them against this injustice. The primary objective was nothing less than his life.
