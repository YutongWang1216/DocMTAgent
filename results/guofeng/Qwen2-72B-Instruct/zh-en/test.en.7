Chapter 449: "The Neighbor's Dog"
After carefully inspecting the house and confirming there were no major issues, they basically decided on it. The remaining matters, such as negotiations with the real estate agent and the original homeowner, would be handled by Nanfeng.
Curly was in an exceptionally good mood today, having had his fill of frolicking around outside.
After swimming around in the sea and being called back to shore by Fangzhao, he played by digging in the sand for quite a while. When it was time to leave, his doggy eyes remained fixed on the window of the car, filled with reluctance.
Seeing this, Nanfeng said with a smile, "Curly, don't worry. Next time we come, you'll be able to go straight inside. Then you can play as long as you want, swim in the sea every day, and even play with little fish and shrimp~"
Curly was delighted, lying in the car and beginning to fantasize about his happy life to come.
What impression does Curly have of the ocean?
The impression of having free access to a seafood buffet.
Its cheerful mood persisted all the way back to the dormitory for continuing education students.
After Nanfeng and the others left, Fangzhao closed the dormitory door, "Come here, Curly."
Curly scampered over, wagging his tail energetically.
"Did you have fun today?"
Fangzhao asked.
"Woof!"
"Was it fun over there?"
Fangzhao asked again.
Curly jumped up and barked again, wagging his tail with particular enthusiasm.
"Speak."
"It was fun!"
Curly said.
It can now switch between languages with ease, speaking clearly and fluently.
"Uh-huh."
Fangzhao nodded, then turned on the learning machine.
Curly: "..."
Twitching his ears and retracting his paws, Curly took a stealthy step backward, thinking he was being inconspicuous.
Fangzhao ignored its retreat, turned on the learning machine, and showed it a newly created folder containing the e-books he had just purchased—
"The Law on the Protection of the Marine Environment"
"The Series on Environmental Protection Knowledge for Youth"
"The List of Protected Marine Wildlife"
"The Management of the Marine Environment"
"The One Hundred Ocean Facts Everyone in the New Century Must Know"
"The Ocean, My Home"
All of them are books related to the ocean, a total of twenty volumes.
Not only were there e-books, but also accompanying test questions, a total of twenty sets.
Curly: "..."
His perked-up ears drooped down.
"Do you read faster now that you know how to?"
"Once you finish reading the twenty books in the folder and score full marks on all corresponding twenty sets of test questions, I'll let you go play in the sea."
"Fangzhao said, "We're expecting no more than fifteen days until we move over there.""
It's all rote memorization material, and with Curly's current memory and learning abilities, achieving perfect scores isn't particularly challenging.
When Curly goes to the sea, Fangzhao isn't concerned about its safety; rather, he worries that Curly might eat some endangered species to the point of extinction.
Just how big Curly's stomach is, Fangzhao still isn't sure to this day.
During the Bu Star recording period, Curly had snuck bites in the desert and in the sea as well, but due to Fangzhao's warnings, Curly hadn't truly let loose and eaten to its full capacity.
After all, their stay on Bu Star was not going to be long, and with Fangzhao keeping watch, plus having to consider others on Bu Star, there wasn't much opportunity for Curly to sneak too many bites.
But once they move into their new home, Curly will have daily access to the sea. Without any restrictions, it would be akin to an invasive species disrupting the ecological balance of these waters with just one dog's appetite.
Fangzhao needed to educate Curly about certain matters in advance—the marine life had好不容易recovered to its current state, and they couldn't let Curly ruin that. 
No full marks, no sea access—continue to keep the learning machine company!
This day, Nanfeng came to see Fangzhao regarding the renovation of their new residence.
Upon entering the dorm room, Nanfeng saw Curly facing the wall, his head drooping dejectedly as he squatted there, with tear stains visible below his eyes.
Pausing in his steps, Nanfeng averted his gaze and went to find Fangzhao, prioritizing the matter at hand.
As for Curly, this was typical behavior, which Nanfeng had become calmly accepting of.
After discussing the renovation, Nanfeng recalled something he had seen earlier and added, "By the way, Boss, did you know about what happened online today?"
"What's up?"
Fangzhao was working on his thesis today and had set his communication settings so that he wouldn't be disturbed unless it was important.
During this period, there were many topics about him online, and many people were looking for him; Fangzhao could only set his communications to do-not-disturb mode.
"Do you know about Will's painting?"
Nanfeng asked.
"Yes, is it about Will's graduation piece?"
Will's graduation art exhibition was also attended by Fangzhao, featuring works that received top A+ grades. Among the pieces was a painting of Curly, titled "The Neighbor's Dog."
The art exhibition was already two days behind them, and since Fangzhao had been working on his thesis in the dormitory since early morning today, he really didn't know what had happened online.
Nanfeng relayed the information he had learned to Fangzhao.
It turned out that after Will's graduation art exhibition, the academy showcased his paintings on the school's website, sparking heated discussions.
Will successfully completed the advanced study plan he set for himself last year—his short-term goal was to paint Fangzhao, and his ultimate goal was to paint Fangzhao's dog.
His short-term goal had been accomplished long ago; Will's painting titled "My Neighbor" sparked heated discussions online, with some netizens joking that Will portrayed Fangzhao as if he were an alien.
This time, following "My Neighbor," "The Neighbor's Dog" once again topped the trending list for the day.
"The Neighbor's Dog" is the piece that took Will the longest time during his advanced studies, one he researched extensively, poured his heart into, and is also his most satisfying work.
This painting shares a similar style with the previous "My Neighbor," though it appears even more cryptic; at least with "My Neighbor," one could discern human features, but "The Neighbor's Dog" doesn't even resemble a dog. Without seeing the title of the artwork, no one would guess that what's depicted is a dog, let alone a small pet dog.
Vibrant colors are applied with a rendering technique that is both enigmatic and grand, seeming almost too otherworldly, yet there's something inexplicably right about it; the more one studies it, the more a sense of awe and tremor rises within.
"Is Fangzhao's dog that terrifying?"
A student at the Royal Academy of Art, recalling the little curly-haired dog they had encountered on campus after seeing this painting, searched online for images of Fangzhao's dog, confirming that their memory was accurate.
As for those at the Royal Academy of Art who had attended Fangzhao's graduation concert and closely analyzed Will's painting, they had a different perspective altogether.
"If I really have to say, the feeling this painting gives me is similar to that of Fangzhao's composition 'Eta'."
"It's a bit beyond the grasp of ordinary people's understanding."
Even a layman standing before this painting, looking at it quietly for just a few seconds, would feel a chill down their spine despite not understanding it, a sensation that sends shivers through their body.
Online, the discussions were even more intense.
"I've found that after further studies, Will has completely let loose, his thoughts freely roaming where we can no longer comprehend them."
"What grudge, what vengeance! How could he depict Fangzhao's dog like this!"
"The friend up ahead must not have seen Will's previous work, 'My Neighbor.' You should familiarize yourself with it first, to see how Will depicted Fangzhao."
"It's possible that Will was bitten by a dog and has psychological trauma from it, otherwise, there's no way he could paint something so terrifying!"
"A cute little thing has been turned into a monster in the painting!"
"This is called art!"
"The world of artists is indeed beyond the comprehension of us mere mortals."
"No exaggeration, I stared at the painting for a full five minutes, still unable to grasp what he was trying to convey, but I strangely felt a sense of awe, with an odd sensation lingering in my heart."
"This is a painting that belongs to a deeper level, requiring meticulous study."
"Is this painting hard to sell?"
"It can also be bought for protection against evil spirits."
"It's still worth investing in, I have high hopes for Will as an artist; he's still young."
In fact, after Will's paintings were displayed on the school network, people started approaching him to buy them.
The last collector from Mu Province purchased the painting "The Neighbor's Dog" at a high price, far exceeding the estimated price set by the Royal Academy of Art.
Some felt that this collector from Mu Province was overly obsessed with Curly, and when it came to Curly, people from Mu Province seemed to always lose their composure.
Others believed it was pure hype, either for Will himself or for Fangzhao's dog; the attitude of people from Mu Province toward dogs was indeed incomprehensible, as if they had lost all reason.
In response, the Royal Province TV station's Calligraphy and Painting Channel specifically sent someone to interview this individual who had purchased the painting at such a high price.
During the interview, the Mu Province collector stated, "Many people buy Will's paintings as an investment in Will himself, not the paintings per se."
"I'm different; I look at the painting, and of course, also at the dog within it."
"I have a hunch that this painting will be hyped up to astronomical prices in the future."
Watching the live interview, Little Bear remarked, "People from Mu Province really have a terrifying intuition about dogs."
"Humans are indeed peculiar creatures."
As a result, due to this painting "The Neighbor's Dog" by Will, Curly also trended on hot search lists and appeared in the headlines of Huangzhou's current affairs news.
After Nanfeng left, Fangzhao browsed through the online news and told Curly, "You shouldn't go out these few days; go back to your books after standing there for five more minutes."
"You only scored 62 on this morning's test, you need to review the section on protecting animals two more times!"
"Can you even eat whales!?"
"You can't eat coral either!"
