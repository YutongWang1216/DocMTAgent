        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 1064, titled \"The Doomsday of Arrowhead Corporation,\" a special forces unit led by Kutbovev successfully infiltrates a base amidst the chaos caused by mortar attacks. They place a beacon on the designated target and safely retreat to the extraction point before calling in an airstrike. Russian stealth bombers drop four air bombs with precision, targeting two ammunition depots and two fuel storages. The resulting explosions devastate the camp, destroying surrounding concrete buildings, causing widespread fires, and leaving the loyalist brigade significantly weakened, with many casualties and injuries. Medical personnel search for survivors, sappers remove unexploded ammunition, and able-bodied soldiers attempt to regroup. Amidst the destruction, Saldes observes the scene, feeling despair as the base is enveloped in smoke and flames, resembling an apocalyptic setting. The aftermath brings no relief, as the mercenaries realize the explosions mark the start of further assaults. Following Jiang Chen's instructions, Sami seizes the opportunity, rallying the remaining rioters to advance towards the front lines.\n\nKey points preserved:\n- Kutbovev's infiltration and placement of the beacon\n- Airstrike by Russian stealth bombers\n- Devastation of the camp, including buildings, fires, and casualties\n- Response of medical personnel, sappers, and soldiers\n- Saldes' despair and observation of the destruction\n- The realization that the explosions signify the beginning of further attacks\n- Sami's leadership in rallying the remaining rioters",

Medical personnel search for survivors, sappers clear unexploded ordnance, and soldiers attempt to regroup amidst the destruction. Saldes witnesses the apocalyptic scene with despair, realizing the explosions signal further assaults. Following Jiang Chen's instructions, Sami rallies the remaining rioters to advance.

Many retreat into the burning base or desert, allowing the Sami forces to assault it.

Amidst the chaos, medical personnel search for survivors, sappers clear unexploded ordnance, and soldiers struggle to regroup. Saldes, the 43-year-old CEO and supreme commander, watches the destruction in despair, aware that the explosions signal further assaults. Following Jiang Chen's instructions, Sami leads over six thousand rioters toward the base, causing the mercenaries' morale to plummet and leading to a breach of the defensive line. As many retreat or desert, the Sami forces assault the base. Jiang Chen, navigating the chaos on a motorcycle and using a laser sword to slice through barriers, advances with Aisha, who eliminates guards, clearing their path to the command center. At the main entrance, they encounter Saldes and a staff officer in a panicked retreat. A swift confrontation ensues, with Aisha neutralizing the staff officer and Jiang Chen subduing Saldes. Using a holographic helmet linked to the Phantom Agent database, Jiang Chen administers a truth serum to Saldes, who reveals that Carmen is located in an underground bunker within the research facility, accessible via an elevator at the base's center, near two helipads.",
