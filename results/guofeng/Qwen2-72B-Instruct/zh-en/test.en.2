Chapter 1303: As Long As It's You (1)
"What are you all doing?!"
The old man of the Eastern Palace tapped his cane in his hand, his voice laced with anger.
"The ancestors are arriving momentarily," the leading man replied. "Please, Old Man of the Eastern Palace, calm down and refrain from agitation; you'll know what we're up to soon enough."
The Old Man of the Eastern Palace naturally knew who the 'ancestors' he was referring to were.
He was a bit at a loss, unsure why Pei Yi wanted to come.
Having a grudge with DK was really not a good thing, even though everyone in R country wanted to drive DK out, it was simply impossible to do so.
Just empty thoughts.
After a few minutes, Pei Yi's car arrived.
He got out of the car, his gaze shifting to the vehicle not far away.
An Xiaoning saw him and, without removing her mask and wig, also got out of the car.
Wu Lianzhi followed closely behind.
"You're here." An Xiaoning spoke up.
Pei Yi gave her a once-over, finding it hard not to laugh. He walked up to her, leaned in a little closer, and lowered his voice. "Hey, with this getup of yours, I bet these people wouldn't be able to guess it's you, huh?"
"Of course. That's precisely why I asked you to come instead, I don't want them to know my identity yet, it's not the right time."
Pei Yi subconsciously glanced at Wu Lianzhi. "How did you end up with him?"
"There's something up."
He straightened his back, turned around, and with a faint smile on his face, he said to the people of the Eastern Palace family, "I wonder how my sister offended someone from your Eastern Palace clan, to the point where you'd want her dead?"
"Do you have the nerve to act so boldly, right under our noses?"
Upon hearing this, the faces of the Eastern Palace family members changed instantly, Pei Yi's sister?
Where did Pei Yi get a sister?
The matriarch of the Eastern Palace family spoke up, "Mr. Pei's sister... we truly had no idea about that whatsoever."
"If you didn't know, it's fine to say so; now I've told you."
Pei Yi said coldly, "Did you hear that loud and clear?"
"Since Mr. Pei claims this is your cousin, just take your cousin away. As for Donggong Lianzhi, his name still appears on our family's genealogy; we have yet to disown this traitorous grandson. He remains a member of the Donggong family, and how we choose to deal with him is strictly a matter within our own family affairs."
Before Pei Yi could respond, An Xiaoning seized the opportunity and called out to him, "Brother, he's my boyfriend. I'm carrying his child now; you can't abandon him."
Pei Yi had originally intended to take only her away, but he hadn't anticipated that the situation would now become rather complicated.
However, being domineering and forceful is his style; for him, such matters are never an issue as long as he wants to do something.
"Old woman, you've heard it too. This man...could also be considered my brother-in-law now. They already have a child together; handing him over to you would mean the child won't have a father in the future, wouldn't it?"
"Do you think I would agree to that?"
The matriarch of the Eastern Palace was well aware that if she let Pei Yi take the person away, they would lose all legitimate grounds to deal with their own grandson in the future. Thus, despite harboring some trepidation toward DK's power, she couldn't afford to show any weakness in her stance.
"Mr. Pei, that's simply not possible. Our family has its own rules and regulations; outsiders are not allowed to interfere in how we handle our own."
"They say he's the father of the child in my sister's womb. Are you getting old and losing your hearing?"
Pei Yi shifted his gaze to Wu Lianzhi. "Tell me, are you a member of the Donggong family?"
"This morning, when my mother attempted to poison me with tainted food, I severed all ties with her as a mother. Before that, when the Donggong family plotted to stage our deaths—mine, Miss An's, and those of his subordinates—I made my stance clear. Though Donggong Lianzhi's name may still be listed in the family registry and on the Donggong family's household records, I no longer bear the Donggong surname. Now, I am known as Wu Lianzhi, and that is my true name. I am no longer a member of the Donggong family!"
Each word was forceful and resonant, every sentence laced with icy coldness.
Uttering these words openly in front of so many people demonstrated the resolve behind his declaration.
"This isn't something you get to decide!" the matriarch of the Eastern Palace family retorted. "Once you enter the Eastern Palace, alive you belong to our family, and dead you're still our family's ghost!"
"And now, Mrs. Donggong, I'd like to ask you this: Miss An is already aware of your plot to murder her. How can you be so focused on punishing me here and now, without any concern about S Country potentially demanding a formal and serious negotiation?"
These words came from Wu Lianzhi, spoken with a detached tone and devoid of any fear.
"I've had dealings with An Xiaoning," Pei Yi said with a slight smile. "She's the type who will always seek revenge for a grudge. Do you really think she'll let you off the hook after you tried to take her life?"
"Enough, no more idle talk. My time is precious, and I'm taking both of them with me."
Seeing that the Donggong family was about to speak again, he added, "If you don't want to see bloodshed here."
Just like that, the members of the Eastern Palace family watched as the duck that was once almost in their grasp flew away completely.
The anger rendered the matriarch and the patriarch of the Eastern Palace family utterly incapable.
In the end, the matriarch of the Eastern Palace family gave the final word, "Enough, enough. Remove his name from the records and erase him from the household registry!"
"We have to return to S Country."
Pei Yi glanced at her sidelong. "Are you planning to withdraw now that you've used me?"
"Weren't you supposed to agree to one of my requests? You're talking about going back to the country before I even mention it?"
"I am eager to return to the country because I have something to attend to, but I truly meant it when I said I'd agree to one of your requests. Go ahead, what is it that you want?"
"Well, my request might be a bit difficult for you..."
"Then let's not mention that. Tell me one that won't put me in a difficult position."
Pei Yi turned to face her, fixing his gaze intently on her. "You really haven't changed at all. Spend half a month with me."
"How exactly do you want me to accompany you?"
"Just like before."
An Xiaoning looked at him, "No, first, no chains, no restriction of my freedom. Second, half a month is too long, two days is acceptable."
"...\" Pei Yi's smile slightly faded. "You're bargaining too much here. Five days, not less. If you say you're letting someone else set the terms, you can't go back on your word. You'll definitely be given your freedom."
"Can I return to the country first?"
"No."
Inside the car, Wu Lianzhi listened to their conversation, truly wondering if there was something going on between the two of them.
Could it be that there's an ambiguous relationship between these two?
It sure sounds like it.
But if that's the case, those two are being far too unguarded in front of him.
"Then how about letting him go back to S Country first, and I'll stay with you alone? Would that work?"
"I won't do anything to you, let's go together." His words brooked no argument.
An Xiaoning said no more.
Because it wasn't far from Mount Qingping, they arrived there soon.
Returning to this place really stirs up a mix of emotions.
When Qin Guo saw her, she was truly unhappy, and the moment they went inside, she immediately rolled her eyes.
Thinking to herself, how did her family's ancestors bring this plague god back again.
