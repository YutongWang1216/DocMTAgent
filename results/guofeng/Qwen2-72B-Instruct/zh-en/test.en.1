Chapter 1064: The Doomsday of Arrowhead Corporation
Under the suppression of the mortars, chaos reigned in the base, and no one noticed that a special forces unit had infiltrated the camp.
With hardly any effort, Kutbovev placed the beacon on the designated target, then led his squad out of the base, safely reaching the extraction point before calling in the airstrike.
Soon, Russian stealth bombers roared overhead through the cloud cover, dropping four air bombs that struck the base's two ammunition depots and two fuel storages with pinpoint accuracy.
The shockwave from the explosions swept across the entire camp, directly toppling a ring of concrete buildings around it.
The exploding ammunition and burning fireballs flew across the camp, triggering a series of chain reactions, with flames everywhere, blood, and bodies littering the scene.
The loyalist brigade stationed within the camp was immediately reduced by nearly half, and most of the survivors were also wounded, making it almost impossible to find a single unscathed individual.
Medical soldiers carrying stretchers moved through the base, searching for incapacitated casualties.
Sappers clad in heavy blast-resistant suits bravely charged into the blaze, dragging out unexploded ammunition from the rubble.
All the soldiers who could still move sprang into action, seeking out their respective units to regroup.
Saldes gazed at the flames outside the window, his dull pupils gradually reflecting a layer of despair.
Thick smoke shrouded the entire base, and the glow of the fires stained the night sky red, akin to a scene straight out of the apocalypse.
"Shit..."
Muttering to himself, he moved his leaden legs and slowly left the window.
Turning around, he met the gaze of the staff officer at the command center.
"Sir, what should we... do?"
The aftermath of the explosions finally subsided, and the base was no longer echoing with the sounds of ammunition detonating. However, no one's heart could find peace. The mercenaries who had narrowly escaped the blasts knew all too well that this was only the beginning of their nightmare.
The previous explosions seemed to ignite a signal, sounding the horn for Sami forces to launch their assault.
On Jiang Chen's instructions, Sami seized this fleeting opportunity, standing before everyone and raising his arms to shout, leading the remaining rioters to charge to the front lines.
Over six thousand people raced across the tundra, charging toward the flickering fires in the pine forest.
Viewed from a distance, the scene was spectacular.
And at the same time, seeing the thick smoke rising from the base behind them, all the mercenaries fighting on the front line were thrown into panic. Their previously high morale plummeted to rock bottom in an instant.
When confronted with a tide of rioters surging forward, even if they had the capability to hold the line, they no longer had the heart to continue fighting.
Without any doubt, Arrowhead Corporation's defensive line was breached, and the stubborn mercenaries crumbled under the sea of bodies employed by the Sami forces.
Some made their way back into the base, now engulfed in flames, but the majority deserted, fleeing deep into the forest.
No need for Jiang Chen to remind them; even a pig would know what to do at a time like this.
Watching as Sami led the rioters to begin their assault on the military base, Jiang Chen put away his binoculars, summoned a pre-prepared off-road motorcycle from his storage space, and gently patted Aisha on the back.
"It's about time, let's get going too."
"Uh-huh!"
Aisha nodded in agreement, and after Jiang Chen mounted the motorcycle, she nimbly straddled it behind him.
The engine growled to life, and the tires kicked up a layer of loose snow.
Jiang Chen raced down the hill on the off-road motorcycle, circling around to the side of the base with Aisha in tow. He parked the bike at the roadside and unfurled a laser sword from his storage space, casually waving it around in his hand. With effortless ease, he sliced through the steel wire mesh barrier.
The entire base was engulfed in flames and chaos, sporadic detonations of mortars still echoing through the air. Every mercenary capable of wielding a gun had been pushed to the frontlines, battling the rioters for control of the main entrance to the base.
Aside from a guard platoon stationed in front of the command center, there was hardly anyone left in the entire rear area.
For Jiang Chen and Aisha, this was practically no different than having no defenses at all.
A total of ten guards were present, with two standing watch on the watchtower, and the remaining eight positioned at the entrances on the first and second floors.
Aisha retrieved her Ghost sniper rifle and silently took out the two guards on the watchtower. Then, using blind spots in their field of view, she methodically eliminated the eight men on the upper and lower floors one by one.
After Aisha had taken care of the guard detail outside the command center, Jiang Chen pulled out his rifle and headed toward the main entrance. Just as he was passing by the Humvee parked at the door, he happened to run into Saldes and the command center's staff officer, who were fleeing in panic from inside.
Meeting each other's eyes, both sides were visibly taken aback for a moment.
The staff officer was the first to recover, immediately reaching into his coat to draw his gun, but before his hand even reached his chest, he was shot in the head by Aisha, who reacted even faster.
Saldes tried to resist, but Jiang Chen easily restrained him, pinning his hands behind his back and pushing him against the nearby Humvee.
"Saldes, male, 43 years old."
"You serve as the CEO of Arrowhead Corporation and also act as the supreme commander, am I right?"
Although it was their first meeting, the holographic helmet on Jiang Chen's head, connected to the Phantom Agent database, contained his photograph and personal information.
With just a glance, intelligence about him was projected onto the holographic screen.
With his face pressed against the hood of the vehicle, Saldes proved to be stubbornly defiant, refusing to surrender as he gritted his teeth and spoke.
"I won't say anything, you might as well kill me..."
"Kill you?"
"I haven't even asked you anything yet."
Jiang Chen flashed a grin, completely unperturbed by his uncooperative attitude, and with his right hand free, he pulled out a syringe, jabbing it unceremoniously into his back shoulder.
"Ughâ€”!"
Letting out a defiant roar from his throat, Saldes stared with bloodshot eyes wide open, but soon the spark in his pupils dimmed.
Jiang Chen simply released his hold on him; there had never been a precedent for ordinary people to resist after being injected with a truth serum.
Flipping Saldes over, Jiang Chen asked, word by word.
"Where is Carmen?"
"In the underground bunker...within the research facility."
"Where is the underground bunker?"
"The entrance is in the center of the base, accessible only via a lift."
"The entrance is next to two helipads, you'll see them as you walk over."
Question and answer, Jiang Chen quickly obtained the intelligence he wanted.
"Very well, now you can have what you wished for."
Jiang Chen pulled out his pistol and fired a shot to Saldes' head, then tossed his corpse to the side.
It was a rather merciful way to die, but for Mr. Saldes, the renowned general manager of the illustrious Arrowhead Corporation, to perish in such an anonymous manner might have been more agonizing than death itself... if the dead could feel pain.
"The underground bunker, huh."
Looking in the direction of the center of the base, a cold smile tugged at the corner of Jiang Chen's mouth.
Whatever schemes Carmen may still be harboring, his luck has surely run out by now.
The fate of the Rothschild family will be much like how they began, rising to prominence because of a war, and fading into obscurity because of another...
However, just then, a shrill and mournful scream echoed from the distance.
