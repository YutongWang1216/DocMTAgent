Chapter 834 - Return to the Holy Land (Part 2)
" vermilion bird." 
In the bamboo house, Bai Yan was watching Bai Xiaochen and Xiao Long'er playfully wrestling. Suddenly, she heard a commotion outside, her willow-like brows furrowing lightly: "What's happening outside? Why is there a noise?"
"Go out and take a look."
The vermilion bird saluted with a fist, acknowledged the order, and retreated. After a while, she pushed open the door of the bamboo house and came in, saying hesitantly, "Queen, there are two people outside who have come to look for you..."
"Looking for me?"
Bai Yan raised her eyebrows. "Then I'll go out and see who has come to look for me."
With that, she rose slowly from the chair and made her way towards the door.
Outside the house, under the blood-colored sky, the two figures crawled forward shakily. Perhaps due to crawling too much, a trail of blood streaked beneath them, which fell into Bai Yan's eyes, appearing exceptionally jarring.
"What are you doing?"
Bai Yan's eyebrows furrowed lightly, and she asked coldly.
The Second Elder's face was pale, his trembling body prostrate on the ground, and he stuttered, "Queen, I've come to apologize to you with humble submission. That day, it was my mistake to believe that impostor, leading the Queen to misunderstand the King. It's all my fault; I'm willing to accept any punishment or scolding. Please, Queen, mete out your judgment."
"No, Queen, it's my fault. I failed to deliver the King's orders to you. In fact, that day the King left the palace to lift the seal on the demon realm. He had instructed me to inform you, but I didn't manage to do so, which gave the scheming villain an opportunity to take advantage."
Fire Feather knelt on the ground, his face streaked with tears: "All the countless mistakes were mine, if the Queen wishes to strike or berate, I shall utter no complaint." He took the bamboo strip from behind him, holding it with both hands, presenting it before Bai Yan, and he bowed his head deeply, his expression one of resolute acceptance of his fate.
Bai Yan's hand slowly gripped the bamboo strip that Fire Feather had presented before her, her expression calm, her eyes radiating an inscrutable light.
Seeming to sense the bamboo strip leaving his hand, Fire Feather's body stiffened. He clenched his jaw tightly, awaiting the impending blow with the force of splitting bamboo.
But...
A long time passed, yet no pain came.
Fire Feather looked up in astonishment, only to see a burst of flames erupt from the bamboo strip in Bai Yan's hand, instantly reducing it to ashes.
"Have you suffered a great deal crawling all this way?"
"Queen... Queen?"
Fire Feather looked at Bai Yan in confusion, perhaps not understanding what she meant by her words.
"Since that's the case, your debts have been repaid. Rise now."
Bai Yan has always been one to distinguish clearly between right and wrong. She targets only those who harbor delusions of harming her.
On that day, if she could be deceived, how much more so the Great Elder and Fire Feather? Thus, she had never harbored any resentment towards them...
Fire Feather's body was rigid as iron, unable to believe that Bai Yan had let them off so easily?
Before coming, they had already steeled themselves for a beating that would leave them bruised all over!
Now, she hadn't even laid a single strike upon them, yet their sins were absolved.
Seeing that the two remained kneeling motionlessly on the ground, Bai Yan's expression darkened slightly. "What is it?"
"Aren't you waiting for me to help you up?"
The woman's sharp voice pierced Fire Feather's ears, startling him into immediately scrambling to his feet from the ground. His trouser legs were soaked with blood, and he could barely stand steady.
Even so, he remained standing on the ground, though his legs continued to tremble, he did not kneel down again.
Bai Yan glanced at the two, noticing their struggle to hold themselves up, and pointed at the stone seats on the ground. "Take a seat; rest for a while, and then you can descend the mountain."
