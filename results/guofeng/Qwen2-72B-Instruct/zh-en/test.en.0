Chapter One: A New Journey
The fierce wind swept through the canyon, stirring up ripples across the grassland.
The wild buffalo, which had been grazing on the tender grass, raised its head and looked toward the sky.
There, a wooden merchant ship dozens of meters long was hovering in the air, its fully spread sails billowing in the wind, moving forward slowly.
"No matter when you look at it, this wind phenomenon is always so spectacular."
The middle-aged man clad in leather armor stood by the deck, looking down upon the boundless grassland and the beautiful scenery below.
"For us merchants, this is also a rare business opportunity."
Standing beside the middle-aged man was a somewhat portly merchant, sporting a head of peculiar curly hair and dressed in a merchant's robe. His small eyes were slightly squinted as if calculating something, gazing at the scenery before him. The way he looked, it seemed as though even the beautiful view before his eyes could be sold for money.
"If not for it, I'm afraid we wouldn't have been able to transport our goods into the central region so quickly."
"To be honest, when I first planned to expand into this market, I faced opposition, but looking at it now, my choice was indeed correct."
"But please allow me to be frank, you chose not to take the major waterways, instead opting for this route, which while saving time, also increases the level of danger."
"I've heard that things haven't been peaceful on the other side recently. Moreover, I believe the captain has also warned you that there seem to be wind serpents lurking around here lately, and if anything were to happen..."
The man's expression became somewhat grave, and he turned his head, directing his gaze towards the nearby mountain range.
The towering peaks obscured his view, preventing him from seeing what lay beyond.
But one could vaguely see that the sky in the distance was not a clear azure, but rather tinged with a somber darkness.
That was not a world they should be venturing into.
"Relax, there aren't that many unforeseen circumstances. Fortune favors the bold, and that's why I'm paying you such a hefty sum!"
"Just a few snakes, isn't that right?"
The merchant reached out and patted the man on the shoulder.
"By the way, how is the young man we rescued doing now?"
"He hasn't died yet, has he?"
"Lijie has already bandaged his wounds, and he's currently in a deep sleep; there shouldn't be any danger to his life."
"That's good."
Hearing the man's response, the merchant nodded in satisfaction, but soon after, he quickly furrowed his brow.
"But what on earth was the young man injured by? Judging from the wound, it looks like a large lizard—though, do we have such peculiar creatures in the north of Parfield?"
"I'm not sure, sir, but it must have been a ferocious beast. Hopefully, we won't encounter one ourselves."
As he spoke, the man subconsciously glanced at the entrance to the cabin, then he turned his head back to face forward.
Rhode opened his eyes.
What happened?
He stared blankly at the ceiling in front of him, his mind muddled and groggy.
He remembered that he was supposed to be leading his team on a raised platform in the ruins, battling the Void Dragon, the most powerful boss in the Dragon Soul Continent, and successfully securing the first kill. He was certain he had received an achievement notification and a system prompt. Then, the Void Dragon's final blow claimed his life.
According to the original plan, Rhode should have respawned at the graveyard and then logged out.
But in the instant he was killed by the Void Dragon, the entire world suddenly turned pitch black, as if forcibly isolated, and subsequently, Rhode lost consciousness.
How could this be possible?
Could it be that there's something wrong with the game?
Rhode struggled to turn his head, able to see the blue sky and white clouds outside the window, where was he?
Where is this place?
What on earth has happened?
Was he still dreaming?
Was he still in the game?
At the very least, Rhode could be sure that this place was absolutely not his cramped rented apartment.
At that thought, confusion immediately welled up in Rhode's heart; he furrowed his brow and then tried to sit up.
"Ah!!!"
And just at that moment, a surge of intense pain suddenly shot through Rhode's chest. He gritted his teeth and froze in his motion.
It was then that Rhode realized that his left shoulder and chest were completely swathed in bandages. Although he didn't know what had happened, judging from the bloodstains seeping through them, he clearly hadn't escaped unscathed.
This is definitely not the game!
Rhode could affirm this much; although technology had advanced significantly by now, and Dragon Soul Continent, as the world's first fully immersive virtual MMORPG, had employed numerous high-tech innovations, the rules stipulated that players should never experience pain. This was designed to distinguish reality from the game, as well as to make the game more accessible to a broader audience.
When a player was injured, instead of experiencing pain, the game would use methods such as slowing down the player's movement speed and overlaying their vision with a red tint representing imminent danger to disrupt normal gameplay, serving as warnings and reminders rather than simulating actual pain.
This practice sparked considerable controversy in society when holographic simulation technology first emerged, and it was impossible for the company operating Dragon Soul Continent to be unaware of this.
Rhode lowered his head, staring at his right hand, which was not the character he had crafted in the game, not the body brimming with muscle and raw vitality.
In contrast, the arm before his eyes was slender and weak, with skin that had an unhealthy pallor due to years without exposure to sunlight.
This was his real-world body, and he was well aware of that fact.
But how did I end up injured?
And besides, this doesn't seem like a hospital, does it?
Rhode looked up, and the entire room seemed to resemble a cabin, devoid of lights, telephones, or call bells.
A wooden table, two chairs, and a cabinet fixed to the wall comprised all the furnishings in the room.
For some inexplicable reason, Rhode felt as though he had seen this scene somewhere before.
And just as Rhode was examining the room carefully, the door suddenly opened.
A blonde girl in a white robe entered the room, her eyes widening in surprise as she looked at Rhode, who was half-sitting up.
"You're awake? That's great!!"
The language the girl spoke was neither Chinese nor English, yet Rhode could understand her clearly nonetheless.
This surprised Rhode somewhat, as he recognized this language.
This is Nim, one of the official languages of Dragon Soul Continent!
"How are you feeling? Are you alright?"
But the girl paid no heed to Rhode's expression; she quickly moved to his side and began carefully examining his left shoulder and chest.
"Your injuries were quite severe, to be honest, I was worried whether you could hold on..."
"This is..."
Rhode furrowed his brow, unsure of how to respond. He turned his head to look at the mirror on the wall beside him, where his face was clearly reflected. It was indeed his face, there was no mistake about that, but it shouldn't be here, should it?
"Have you forgotten?"
The blonde girl blinked her eyes in confusion, her twin tails swaying slightly with her movements, her clear blue eyes giving off a lively impression.
"Two days ago, you were found collapsed in the Parfield Plains, with rather severe injuries."
"If it weren't for the cargo ship of the 'Silver Scale' Chamber of Commerce passing by, things would have been quite dire."
"I really wonder what you were fighting, given the serious damage to your left side—it was truly perilously close to being too late."
Wait, the left shoulder?
Rhode was taken aback; he immediately recalled that during his final battle with the Void Dragon, hadn't he been struck on his left side?
But those were injuries sustained by his character in the game, which should have had nothing to do with the player himself, right? Yet now, it was his own body that was injured?
Despite the chaos unfolding before him, Rhode quickly regained his composure—a testament to his mental fortitude as a top-tier player and the president of the world's most powerful online gaming guild.
Through his conversation with the blonde girl before him, Rhode learned about his current predicament: He had been severely wounded and lay stricken in the Parfield Plains, whereupon the floating vessel of the Silver Scale Chamber of Commerce happened upon him, rescuing him in the nick of time.
According to the blonde girl, Rhode's initial condition was far from promising, yet his recuperative abilities proved to be remarkably strong.
"My name is Lijie Noelle. I'm a member of the Star Moon Mercenary Group, a Spirit Master. You can just call me Lijie."
The girl introduced herself to Rhode openly and candidly.
"My name is Rhode Arent."
Although still unable to make sense of the situation at hand, Rhode, after a moment's hesitation, disclosed his in-game identity and ID.
"From the eastern mountain plains, he's an adventurer."
"An adventurer, I see, that's why you were all alone in such remote mountains."
Hearing Rhode's response, Lijie wasn't surprised, for on this continent, many adventurers favored solitary expeditions into uncharted territories, so there was nothing particularly odd about the identity Rhode had revealed.
"But, just what were you fighting against?"
"Why did you sustain such severe injuries?"
"I remember that in this plain area, there shouldn't be any particularly terrifying monsters."
Hearing the girl's inquiry, Rhode gave a somewhat awkward smile.
What could he say? Was he supposed to tell Lijie that he had been injured while battling the Void Dragon, one of the Five Dragons of Creation?
"Since I was attacked at night, I didn't get a clear look at what they were. There were many of them, and they were fast. I suspect they might have been creatures from 'over there.'"
"I see."
Although Rhode did not elaborate, Lijie nodded as if she understood, then proceeded to carefully examine Rhode's wound before standing up.
"You haven't eaten for two days, I imagine you must be very hungry. Please wait a moment, I'll go get you something to eat right away."
"Oh, right, I need to report this to the captain. I'm sure he'll come to see you soon."
Having said this, the girl politely nodded slightly towards Rhode, then turned and walked out of the room.
