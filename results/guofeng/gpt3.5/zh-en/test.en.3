Chapter 1898 Do not think about it, it's hard to forget (4)
Yan RuSheng gave her a disdainful look, "Wen Xuxu, you're so narcissistic."
"Am I not good-looking?"
Wen Xuxu frowned, pouted, pretending to be angry.
Yan RuSheng was stunned for a moment, then smiled and, holding up Wen Xuxu's upper body with one hand, pinched her chest forcefully.
Lowering his head, he glared at her, gritting his teeth, "... cunning stupid woman."
He quickened his pace, walked to the side of the bed, showing no mercy or pity, and directly threw Wen Xuxu onto the bed, then unbuttoned her shirt one by one without any hesitation.
He unbuckled his belt, removed all the restraints on his body, then climbed into the bed, pressing down on Wen Xuxu.
Rough and straightforward, not elegant at all.
His deep black eyes met hers, causing Wen Xuxu's heart to uncontrollably accelerate.
Yes, after being together for so many years, every time she meets his gaze like this, her heart still flutters like a little deer, feeling shy and embarrassed.
Perhaps because they were too familiar, she always felt embarrassed.
So, as they say, it's not good to go after someone you know well, just like how a rabbit doesn't eat grass near its burrow.
Watching Xuxu blush and feel shy, Yan RuSheng felt both excited and frustrated, the excitement being his hormones reacting automatically, and the frustration being from within himself.
Although he likes to see her shy appearance, he doesn't like how she becomes awkward and reserved because of her shyness, always being so restrained and not taking the initiative.
"What else do you want to hear? I've told you everything, just look at me."
Yan RuSheng held Xuxu's face in his hands, forcing her to meet his gaze.
Xuxu's face grew even redder, she pouted, her gaze wandering, "Then hurry up and say, did you also steal the love letter someone else gave me?"
"Uh..."
Yan RuSheng pretended to think, saying as he thought, "In addition to Zhao Zheng's love letter, Jiang ZhuoHeng's chocolate and movie tickets, there's also the Rainbow Candy Store owned by Hao Bang, the son of Chief Hao from the Public Security Bureau who is a year older than us."
Upon hearing this, Xuxu was very surprised, "What? Hao Bang?"
The science champion who is known as the "praised by ten thousand people"?
The reason why he is known as "praised by ten thousand people" is because of his name, not because ten thousand people actually praise him. Just by calling his name, it is praising him as being excellent.
When she heard this name, she knew that there was someone with that name in school, and she felt very negative.
But isn't that guy a bookworm? How could he also give her things?
"Yes, this name is really cheap, and the person who named it is even cheaper."
Yan RuSheng said disdainfully, "Luckily, I ate that lollipop for you. It was dyed with artificial colors, and it made my tongue and lips colorful at the time. Junk food, cheap goods."
Xuxu: "..."
According to what he said, does she still have to thank him for eating something that was given to her by someone else on her behalf?
Xuxu felt both angry and amused, unable to resist the urge, she reached out and poked Yan RuSheng's forehead hard, saying, "Yan RuSheng, why don't you fly up to the sky?"
He really likes to take advantage of others and act cute, this is something he enjoys doing the most.
After saying that, she looked at him and asked with a smile, "So, did you not like Chief Hao before because of Hao Bang?"
Although it was a question, her tone was firm.
"..." Yan RuSheng pursed his lips and fell silent, tacitly agreeing.
Xuxu, feeling a bit embarrassed, fell into his deep, dark eyes again. She pursed her lips and let out a soft "uh," her gaze awkwardly shifting elsewhere.
Then she asked, "How did you manage all of these? Why didn't I know?"
She pursed her lips, as if trying to find something to talk about.
