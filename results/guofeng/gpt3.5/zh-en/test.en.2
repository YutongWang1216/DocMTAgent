Chapter 1303: As Long As You (1)
"What are you guys doing?!"
The old man from the Eastern Palace knocked on his cane, his voice filled with anger.
"Our ancestors will be here soon, please be patient, Lord of the Eastern Palace. You will know what we are up to in a moment," the leader replied.
The old man from the Eastern Palace naturally knew who the "ancestors" referred to by the man.
He was a little at a loss, not knowing why Pei Yi had come.
It's really not a good idea to have a grudge with DK. Although everyone in Country R wants to drive DK out, it's simply impossible.
Just wishful thinking.
A few minutes later, Pei Yi's car arrived.
He got out of the car and his gaze shifted to the car not far away.
An Xiaoning saw him, but did not remove his mask and wig, and also got out of the car.
Wu Lianzhi followed closely behind.
"You're here," An Xiaoning spoke.
Pei Yi looked her up and down, rare smile appearing on his face, walked up to her, approached her closely, and whispered in a low voice, "Oh, these people are having a hard time guessing it's you with this look, aren't they?"
"Of course, I just don't want them to know my identity, that's why I had you come, now is not the time yet."
Pei Yi instinctively glanced at Wu Lianzhi, "Why are you with him?"
"Something came up."
He stood up straight, turned around, with a faint smile on his face, and said to the people from the Eastern Palace family, "I don't know what my sister did to offend the people of your Eastern Palace family, that they want to kill her?"
"Have your courage grown to the top of your head?"
Upon hearing this, the people from the Eastern Palace family's expressions instantly changed, Pei Yi's sister?
Where did Pei Yi's sister come from?
The old lady from the Eastern Palace spoke up, "Mr. Pei's sister... we really have no idea at all."
"I don't know, but now I'll tell you."
Pei Yi said coldly, "Did you hear clearly?"
"Since Mr. Pei says this is your cousin, then please take your cousin away. As for Dong Gong Lianzhi, his name is still recorded in our family tree, and has not been removed as a rebellious descendant. He is still a member of our Eastern Palace family. How we handle him is a matter for our Eastern Palace family."
Before Pei Yi could respond, An Xiaoning took the opportunity to call out to him, "Brother, he is my boyfriend. I am now carrying his child in my belly. You can't abandon him."
Pei Yi originally intended to only take her away, but now it has become a bit tricky.
However, being overbearing and domineering is also his style. As long as he wants to do something, this is simply not a big deal.
"Old lady, you heard it too. This... can also be considered my brother-in-law. They already have children. If we hand them over to you, won't the children be left without a father in the future?"
"Do you think I will agree?"
The old lady from the Eastern Palace was well aware that if they let Pei Yi take the person away, they would no longer be able to openly deal with their grandson, so even though they feared DK's influence, their attitude could not weaken.
"Mr. Pei, I'm afraid this may not be possible. Our family has its own rules, and when it comes to dealing with our own people, outsiders are not allowed to interfere."
"They said he is the father of the child in my sister's belly. Are you getting old and your ears not working well?"
Pei Yi turned his gaze towards Wu Lianzhi and asked, "You, are you a member of the Eastern Palace family?"
"This morning, when my mother brought me poisoned food, I immediately severed the mother-daughter relationship with her. Previously, when the Eastern Palace family attempted to orchestrate the accidental deaths of Miss An, myself, and his subordinates, I had already made it clear. Although the name Dong Gong Lianzhi still appears in the family tree and the household register of the Eastern Palace family, I no longer bear the surname Dong Gong. I am now surnamed Wu, and Wu Lianzhi is my current name. I am no longer a member of the Eastern Palace family!"
Every word is forceful, every sentence exudes a coldness.
Saying these words openly in front of so many people proves his determination.
"This is not for you to decide!" the old lady from the Eastern Palace said, "Those who enter our Eastern Palace are our family members, and those who die are our ghosts!"
"Madam from the Eastern Palace, I want to ask you, now that Miss An is aware of your plot to murder her, are you in the mood to punish me here without worrying about the serious protest from the S country?"
The words came from Wu Lianzhi's mouth, with a tone that was unfamiliar and fearless.
"I have had dealings with An Xiaoning," Pei Yi smiled slightly, "She is the type who seeks revenge for any wrongdoing. If you want her life, will she just let it go?"
"Alright, enough nonsense, I won't waste any more time. I'll take both of them away."
Seeing that the Eastern Palace family members were about to speak again, he added, "If you don't want bloodshed here."
In this way, the members of the Eastern Palace family watched as the duck that had already been cooked flew away completely.
The old lady and old man from the Eastern Palace were really angry.
Finally, the old lady from the Eastern Palace directly spoke, "Forget it, forget it, strike his name off the register and destroy his household registration!"
"We have to return to the S country."
Pei Yi glanced at her, "Use and then withdraw?"
"You said you would agree to one request of mine, but I haven't even mentioned it yet, and you're already talking about going back to the country?"
"I am in a hurry to return to my home country for something, but it is true that I agreed to one request from you, so go ahead, what is the request?"
"Well, my request might make you feel a little awkward..."
"Then let's not mention it, tell me something that I won't feel awkward about."
Pei Yi turned sideways, staring at her intently without looking away, "You really haven't changed at all, accompany me for half a month."
"How do you want me to accompany you?"
"The same as before."
An Xiaoning looked at him, "No, first, I can't be chained, my freedom cannot be restricted, second, half a month is too long, two days will do."
"..." Pei Yi's smile faded slightly, "You're bargaining too much, five days, not less. You asked others to make demands, they did, you can't go back on your word, they will definitely give you freedom."
"Can I go back to my home country first?"
"No."
Wu Lianzhi in the car listened to the conversation between the two of them and couldn't help but wonder if they were having an affair.
Could these two have some unclear relationship?
It feels like that no matter how you listen.
But if that's the case, those two people are too indiscreet in front of him.
"Then let him go back to S country first, and I will stay with you, is that okay?"
"I won't do anything to you, let's go together." His words were beyond doubt.
An Xiaoning said nothing more.
Because they were not far from Qingping Mountain, they arrived quickly.
Returning to this place really stirs up mixed feelings.
Qin Guo was really unhappy when she saw her, and as soon as they entered, she rolled her eyes immediately.
Thinking about how her ancestors from the Eastern Palace family have brought this jinx back again.
