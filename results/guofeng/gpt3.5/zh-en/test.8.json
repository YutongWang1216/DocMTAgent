        "new_tgt_summary": "Lin Sheng receives guidance from a Warlock Chief on using the evil spirit door to explore other spatial mysteries. The Warlock Chief explains how they can transport their consciousness to multiple possible locations by making slight modifications to the teleportation base. Lin Sheng is amazed by the randomness of the process as his perception is enveloped by ritual fluctuations within the evil spirit door. Additionally, Lin Sheng learns how to split his consciousness into more than ten parts, allowing him to perceive multiple spatial auras simultaneously. The Warlock Chief teaches him how to remember spatial coordinates by leaving simple marks, and due to the strong nature of his consciousness soul, Lin Sheng is able to control summoned creatures and remember aura fluctuations effortlessly. He successfully reveals the coordinates of a special space, impressing the Warlock Chief, and the process of locating spatial mysteries and establishing teleportation portals is described.",
