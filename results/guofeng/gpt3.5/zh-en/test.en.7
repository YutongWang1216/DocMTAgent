Chapter 449 "The Neighbor's Dog"
After carefully inspecting the house and confirming that there were no major issues, we basically made up our minds. Nan Feng will handle the remaining matters by talking to the real estate agent and the previous homeowner.
Juan Mao is in a great mood today, he went out and had a blast.
After swimming in the sea and being called ashore by Fang, it played in the sand for a while. When leaving, the dog kept staring out the car window, full of reluctance.
Nan Feng smiled and said, "Juan Mao, don't worry. Next time you come, you can move in directly. You can play as long as you want, swim in the sea every day, and play with small fish and shrimp~"
Juan Mao was happy, lying in the car and starting to fantasize about his future happy life.
What impression does Juan Mao have of the ocean?
The impression of having a seafood buffet for free.
Its cheerful mood continued until it returned to the dormitory for repair and accommodation.
After Nan Feng and the other two left, Fang closed the dormitory door, "Juan Mao, come here."
Juan Mao swished his tail and approached.
"Did you have fun today?"
Fang asked.
"Woof!"
"Is it fun over there?"
Fang asked again.
Juan Mao jumped up and barked again, wagging his tail vigorously.
"Speak."
"Fun!"
Juan Mao said.
It can now switch languages proficiently and speak with a standard pronunciation.
"Mm."
Fang nodded, then opened the study machine.
Juan Mao: "..."
With a flick of his ear, Juan Mao curled his paws and thought he was discreetly taking a step back.
Ignoring its retreat, Fang opened the study machine and showed it a newly created folder containing the recently purchased e-books—
The Marine Environment Protection Law
"Series on Environmental Protection Knowledge for Adolescents"
The Directory of Marine Wildlife Conservation
"Marine Environmental Management"
"100 Ocean Knowledge that People Must Know in the New Century"
"Oceans, My Home"
All of the books are related to the ocean, totaling twenty in all.
Not only are there e-books, but also accompanying test questions, twenty sets in total.
Juan Mao: "..."
His excited ears drooped down.
"Do you know you read quickly, now you should be even faster?"
"After finishing reading the twenty books in the folder and getting full marks on the corresponding twenty sets of test questions, I will let you go play in the sea."
"It is estimated that there is no more than fifteen days left before moving in," Fang said.
It's all rote memorization, but with Juan Mao's current memory and learning abilities, getting full marks isn't difficult.
When Juan Mao goes to the sea, Fang is not worried about its safety. On the contrary, he is worried that Juan Mao might eat certain endangered marine animals to extinction.
Fang still doesn't know just how big Juan Mao's stomach is up to now.
During the Port Star recording, Juan Mao has sneaked food in the desert and in the sea, but due to Fang's warning, Juan Mao did not truly open up its stomach to eat.
After all, Juan Mao didn't stay in Port Star for long, under Fang's supervision and considering other people in Port Star, it couldn't eat too much even if it sneaked food.
But after moving to the new house, Juan Mao will have the opportunity to go to the sea every day. Without control, it would be equivalent to species invasion, and one dog alone could disrupt the ecological balance of this marine area.
Fang wants to make Juan Mao understand in advance that marine life has gradually recovered to its current state, and Juan Mao must not destroy it.
If you don't pass with full marks, forget about going to the sea and continue studying with the learning machine!
On this day, Nan Feng came to Fang to discuss the renovation of the new residence.
As soon as Nan Feng entered the dormitory, he saw Juan Mao facing the wall, with his head drooping and sitting there dejectedly, with tear marks below his dog eyes.
Pausing for a moment, Nan Feng shifted his gaze away and went to find Fang to first handle the matters at hand.
As for Juan Mao, this is the norm, and Nan Feng has already learned to calmly handle it.
After discussing the renovation matters, Nan Feng remembered what he saw today and added, "By the way, boss, do you know about the online incident today?"
"What's the matter?"
Fang is working on his thesis today, with his communication settings adjusted so he won't be disturbed unless it's something important.
During this period, there have been many discussions about him online, and many people have been trying to contact him, so Fang can only set his phone to "Do Not Disturb" mode.
"Do you know about Will's painting?"
Nan Feng asked.
"I know, is it about Will's graduation work?"
Fang also went to see Will's graduation painting exhibition, which also received an A+ grade. One of the paintings in his graduation work is of Juan Mao, titled "The Neighbor's Dog".
The painting exhibition has been over for two days, and Fang has been working on his thesis in the dormitory since this morning. He really has no idea what has been happening online.
Nan Feng told Fang what he had learned.
It turns out that after Will's graduation painting exhibition, the school displayed his paintings on the school website, sparking discussions.
Will successfully completed the continuing education plan he set last year - the short-term goal was to paint Fang, and the long-term goal was to paint Fang's dog.
The short-term goal was completed long ago. Will's painting "My Neighbor" initially sparked discussions online, with netizens joking that Will painted Fang to look like an alien.
This time, following "My Neighbor", "The Neighbor's Dog" once again made it to the hot search list of the day.
"The Neighbor's Dog" was the longest, most researched, most labor-intensive, and also the most satisfactory work for Will during his continuing education period.
This painting is similar in style to the previous "My Neighbor", but it appears more difficult to understand. While "My Neighbor" could still be recognized as a personal portrait, "The Neighbor's Dog" doesn't look like a dog at all. If it weren't for the name of the painting, no one would think that the painting depicts a dog, let alone a small pet dog.
The vibrant color rendering, mysterious yet containing a grand aura, seems to be overly transcendent, but it's hard to pinpoint any flaws. The more you study it, the more a sense of awe rises in your heart.
"Is Fang's dog really that scary?"
After seeing this painting, a student named Huang Yi recalled the small curly-haired dog he had encountered on campus, then searched online for Fang's dog to confirm that he remembered correctly.
As for Huang Yi, those who have heard Fang's graduation concert and closely analyzed Will's painting have a different perspective.
"If you really want to say it, the feeling this painting gives me is similar to Fang's piece "η"."
"It's a bit beyond the average person's understanding."
Even if a layman stands in front of this painting, quietly looking at it for a few seconds, even if they don't understand it, they will still feel a shiver in their heart and body.
Online, the discussions are even more intense.
"I found that Will, after further studies, has completely let his thoughts run free, galloping in freedom, beyond the understanding of people like us."
"What grudge does he have to paint Fang's dog like this!"
"The friend earlier must not have seen Will's previous work, 'My Neighbor'. Take a look at how Will painted Fang before."
"Maybe Will was bitten by a dog and has a psychological shadow towards dogs, otherwise he wouldn't paint them so scary!"
"A cute little one turned into a monster!"
"This is called art!"
"The world of artists is truly not something us ordinary people can understand."
"Not exaggerating or pretending, I stared at the painting for a full five minutes, still unable to grasp what he wanted to express, but just felt inexplicably awesome, with a strange feeling in my heart."
"This type of artwork belongs to a deeper level and requires careful study."
"Is this painting hard to sell?"
"It can also be used to ward off evil spirits when bought back."
"It's still worth investing in, I have high hopes for this artist Will, he is still young."
Actually, after Will's painting was exhibited on the school website, someone approached him to buy the painting.
The last collector from Muzhou paid a high price for "The Neighbor's Dog," far exceeding Huang Yi's estimated price.
Some people believe that this collector from Muzhou is overly enthusiastic about Juan Mao, as they always seem to lack calmness when facing Juan Mao.
Some also believe this is purely a publicity stunt, not for Will himself but for Fang's dog, and the way people from Muzhou handle the matter of dogs is indeed incomprehensible, as if they have lost their minds.
In response, the Huangzhou TV calligraphy and painting channel specifically sent someone to interview the person who bought the painting at a high price.
During the interview, the collector from Muzhou expressed, "Many people buy Will's paintings, investing in Will himself rather than the paintings."
"I am different, I am looking at the painting, of course also for the dog in the painting."
"I have a feeling that this painting will be skyrocketed to a sky-high price in the future."
Seeing the live interview, Xiao Xiong commented, "People from Muzhou really have a terrifying intuition when it comes to dogs."
"Indeed, humans are truly peculiar creatures."
Therefore, due to Will's painting "The Neighbor's Dog," Juan Mao also appeared on the hot search and made headlines in the current affairs news of Huangzhou.
After Nan Feng left, Fang flipped through the online news and said to Juan Mao, "Don't go out these days, just stand for five minutes and go back to read."
"I only scored 62 on the morning test, I need to review the section on protecting animals again!"
"Can whales be eaten?"
"Coral cannot be eaten either!"
