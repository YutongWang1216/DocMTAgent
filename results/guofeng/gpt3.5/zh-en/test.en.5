Chapter 369: Out of Danger
The situation was overwhelmingly one-sided, with both sides firing with all their might, filling the entire sky above the ocean with smoke and gunpowder.
Bai Ye once again fired the high-speed magnetic wave scanning gun in his hand, smashing another plane, the gun was really handy, he was getting addicted to using it, Xiao Naibao commanded calmly, the air force of the first terrorist organization formed an invincible offensive and defensive team, starting the final round of fierce attacks.
Seeing the situation was not good, Nickla, disregarding etiquette, raised his voice, "Master, let's retreat. If we continue like this, we will be completely wiped out."
Louis clenched his fists tightly, his face covered in gloom, full of hostility, he could clearly see the current situation.
But he was unwilling to accept being driven back like this, they were so close, he could have captured them again, it was really frustrating.
The man's emerald green eyes, with a glimpse of killing intent, then hidden in those silent and melancholic eyes, nodded towards Nickla, immediately ordering to cover and retreat.
Louis gazed at the two figures drifting in the sky above the sea, snorted coldly, this time they were lucky, he wouldn't let it go just like that.
"Darling, they are retreating, shall we pursue?" Bai Ye chuckled lightly, he had a special fondness for this magnetic wave scanning gun, holding it as if holding a child, a faintly indifferent and dangerous smile curved his lips.
Xiao Naibao also smiled elegantly, ordered to stop the attack, a calmness filled his pitch-black eyes, and he slowly said, "Not pursuing, letting him die like this would be too much of a pity, the cat and mouse game has just begun."
This game has already turned the tables.
Louis, he should never have, absolutely should not have provoked him, Nono's death, he must find someone to accompany her in burial, otherwise he will not be able to swallow this anger.
When the game starts, Louis calls the shots, but...
Xiao Naibao's smile was cold and sharp, imposing and intimidating. When it comes to when it will end, he has the final say.
Bai Ye smiled, casually brushed his sleeves, "Alright, let's not pursue, we have plenty of capital to play with him. Maybe they won't even have a chance to act, Louis will have someone rushing to deal with him."
Xiao Naibao watched the direction they were escaping in, coldly smiling without saying a word.
"Chu Li, it's over, no need for support, let's go back immediately."
Bai Ye and Chu Li ordered their subordinates to turn back to Rome after a phone call.
It took a tremendous amount of effort for Heiying and the others to drag Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya up, they all knew that Cheng Anya had a virus on her, so they had taken protective measures early on, Ye Sanshao also warned them that he had a virus on him, making Heiying and the others even more cautious.
Ye Sanshao lay down, panting heavily like a bull, couldn't help but kick Miss Cheng, "Xiao Anya, you need to lose some weight, it's too heavy."
His entire shoulder felt a bit numb because he had been swimming in the sea for a long time, consuming a lot of physical energy, and then dangling Cheng Anya like this, it was really exhausting for his arms.
He almost didn't catch her and throw her into the sea. Thinking back to that scene still gives him a chill.
Heiying and the others cheered for their safety, passing towels, pouring hot water, all busy with their tasks, and someone took the opportunity to tease Ye Sanshao about how he had been these days.
The plane was lively, when men are together, there is always a sense of pride.
Cheng Anya took the towel handed to her by Heiying and wiped her hair, then wrapped her cold body in a blanket. She automatically tuned out his words, finally feeling safe. She sneezed, unable to help but wrap herself a little tighter.
Heiying chuckled and said, "Sanshao, if the lady gets any thinner, you'll be complaining that she's all bones."
"I'm disgusted right now."
Ye Sanshao also got up and dried the seawater on his body, "It's because of all bones that I'm so heavy."
Cheng Anya continued to uphold the virtue of silence is golden, Heiying found two sets of clothes for them to change into. Since they were men's clothes, it looked quite comical on Miss Cheng, so she simply wrapped herself in a blanket.
Just as they changed into new clothes, Heiying told her that Ningning wanted to speak with her.
Cheng Anya excitedly grabbed the microphone, "Baby, it's mommy."
"Hi, mommy, miss your baby?"
Xiao Naibao sat on the sofa, chatting with Cheng Anya with a smile on her face. It had been a long time since she heard her mommy's voice, and she missed it quite a bit.
"Not at all."
Cheng Anya coldly snorted, revealing a fierce tone, "You are so incompetent, only finding mommy this late, you deserve a scolding."
Ningning thought of her promise, her heart skipped a beat, then smiled, "Okay, baby, scold me when we return to Rome. You can scold me however you want. I really miss mommy. Mommy, you're not being nice to me at all. I despise you."
"Reverse contempt."
Cheng Anya laughed and asked worriedly, "You didn't get hurt, did you?"
"No, I'm fine, nothing happened, don't worry." Ningning smiled and said, "Mommy, the plane is about to land, we'll talk later."
"Okay."
Xiao Naibao turned off the communicator, Cheng Anya drank hot water to warm herself up, and Ye Sanshao, who had been eagerly waiting to chat with his son, ended up getting hung up without talking. He was very dissatisfied, his eyes accusingly looking at Cheng Anya.
Miss Cheng calmly ignored him, while Heiying smiled and said, "Sanshao, the plane is about to land, you'll be able to see the young master soon."
Feeling completely ignored, Ye Sanshao couldn't help but give Miss Cheng a twist, "Heartless little thing."
"Stingy ghost."
Cheng Anya laughed and scolded, giving him the hot water. Ye Sanshao filled Miss Cheng's cup and drank the remaining hot water himself. It would be even more wonderful if there was a little bit of alcohol to warm the body at this moment.
The plane quickly landed, all landing in the castle. Chu Li, Ye Wei, and the others were all there. When they saw Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya were safe, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.
"Third Brother, Third Sister-in-law, you two look quite disheveled..."
Ye Wei laughed so hard that her branches trembled, "Third Brother, I should take a picture of this as a keepsake."
"Stinky girl."
Ye Sanshao laughed and scolded, Ye Wei, Eleven, and Xiao Naibao were all fine, and he finally felt relieved.
After all the effort, how could there be another accident?
Xiao Naibao happily wanted to hug Cheng Anya, but was sternly stopped by her. Only then did Xiao Naibao remember that his mommy had the virus on her, as Heiying had already mentioned. Then he looked at the hands of his parents held together, feeling a slight heaviness in his heart.
"Daddy, mommy, are you both... Bai Ye, please help them look."
Xiao Naibao's first reaction was to find Bai Ye, as he was a genius doctor, capable of curing any illness.
"I know, I know, don't worry."
Bai Ye smiled.
"Virus?"
A handsome blond man with blue eyes blinked, "Xiao Bai, this isn't your strong suit, is it?"
Xiao Bai?
Bai Ye twisted his wrist and smiled gracefully and gently, "Jason, try calling me Xiao Bai again?"
"...Damn, what's wrong with me calling you Xiao Bai? I've always been Xiao Bai, and you guys even call Black Jack Xiao Tie."
Jason, also known as the Fire Dragon, spewed fire on the spot, looking like the Golden-Haired Lion King, but equally handsome and causing everyone to be outraged.
Especially those sky-blue eyes, shining like sapphires.
When he gets angry, there is a terrifying aura, as if erupting like a volcano, exuding a very prominent dominance.
On the side, Black Jack is a young man in his twenties, very delicate-looking. He is of mixed Chinese and English descent, with features that are mysterious like those of an Easterner, yet deep like those of a Westerner. He has a pair of gray-blue eyes that always seem misty and hazy, giving off an illusion of deep affection. However, upon closer inspection, you will find that he is extremely sharp, with a restrained demeanor that hides nothing.
The two leaders of the first terrorist organization, both young in age and with contrasting personalities, exude a strong presence, with each possessing a dominating aura, not to mention the presence of the three major leaders here.
Looking at this row, it has a strong visual impact.
"Jason, you really need a beating."
Eleven snorted, "What's wrong with calling him Xiao Bai, Xiao Bai, beat him."
Ye Wei glanced at them, shook her head, "Third Brother, Third Sister-in-law, don't mind them, you should take a hot bath first, check later to avoid getting sick."
She called a maid to take Ye Chen and Cheng Anya downstairs to freshen up. Although Xiao Naibao wanted to follow, he stayed here. Bai Ye pretended to hit someone, and Xiao Naibao quickly pulled his sleeve.
"Bai Ye, do you have a way to save my daddy and mommy?"
The child's eyes were bright, like two black grapes set in a white and tender face, full of anticipation. It was as if Bai Ye's shake of the head would dim the light in his eyes.
Jason grabbed Xiao Naibao and hugged him, full of courage, "Baby, don't worry. Xiao Bai can save even the dead, let alone the living. Stop worrying and come help me take down the Mafia's defenses when you have time."
"Who was just questioning Bai Ye's medical skills?"
Black Jack expressed confusion about this, but Jason swiftly dodged his palm.
Xiao Naibao was held by the tall guy, feeling extremely conflicted. He kicked Jason and said, "Put me down."
"I also want a son like this. Ningning, how about you be my son? I have long coveted you." Jason's deep blue eyes burst with intense light, as if Xiao Naibao was a piece of fat waiting to be devoured.
Everyone, "..."
Bai Ye smiled and said, "Jason, let your mom teach you Chinese again. Don't always say that the commander doesn't know how to use words, it won't do you any good."
"Me and the commander are not on the same level, right?"
Jason was very dissatisfied with being linked to the commander, as the saying goes, officials and bandits are not from the same family, this is a matter of principle.
Xiao Naibao struggled for a moment, and Jason let him down. Xiao Naibao asked, "Bai Ye..."
"Ningning, wait for me to examine them before we can confirm, don't worry for now." Bai Ye said, rubbing Xiao Naibao's head, "I promise to do my best."
Xiao Naibao, who just lost his promise and cannot guarantee the life and death of his parents, regardless of how calm he may appear, feels uneasy in his heart. Bai Ye understands his current state of mind very well.
"Don't worry too much," Bai Ye said.
Ye Wei said, "Alright, leave it to Bai Ye. There is no problem in this world that cannot be solved. Since Louis can develop the virus, there must be an antidote. It's impossible to have no solution. If Bai Ye can't solve it, we'll take down his sign."
Chu Li smiled, "Agreed."
"Xiao Bai, do you have a sign?"
Jason expressed deep confusion, as he had never known what his sign was.
Eleven really wanted to punch him.
"Speaking of which, how come you two didn't catch Louis and bring him back?"
Black Jack asked, "If this guy died earlier, we would have been at ease long ago."
"I've been wanting to take him down for a long time. Recently, the Mafia has been provoking everywhere. Even when their headquarters have been bombed, this guy still has the mood to play around with love affairs. It's really foolish."
"Louis is not in a hurry." Xiao Naibao said slowly, a dangerous curve appearing on his face, his pitch-black eyes gleaming with calculation, "Winning without fighting is the highest realm of victory. His personal grudge with us is one thing, but the battle between the Mafia and the terrorist organization is another."
It will definitely take a lot of financial and material resources to wipe out the Mafia.
After this incident, his position in the Mafia is shaky. I have always suspected that there is a force within the Mafia hiding in a place we cannot see. Otherwise, they would not allow Louis to act in a self-destructive manner. In that case, let Louis lead the way for us, expose this force, and annihilate it in one fell swoop."
Deceitful...
This is the unanimous thought of everyone.
Although knowing that he has always been very sinister and cunning, because he is too young, everyone always tends to spoil him. Coupled with his tender appearance, people will always overlook his true nature.
"Sinister!"
Jason thumbs up, he has always been proactive, unlike the others who think too much, but most of the time, he listens to Black Jack and Chu Li's plans.
Xiao Naibao's plan, he has always been obedient to.
After a proactive individual, there is a powerful think tank, this force is very terrifying.
"Ningning's approach, I agree." Chu Li said, he and Bai Ye have always agreed with his ideas, "Once and for all, to prevent someone from being ignorant and constantly provoking."
"When has Ningning's words ever been refuted by you, colluding in a deceitful manner."
Black Jack smiled and said, "But this time, indeed, the Mafia should be taught a lesson, so that they will have to detour when they see us for the next fifty years."
Bai Ye nodded, he had no objections either. His priority was to be able to remove the virus from Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya, that was the crucial issue, the rest could be left to Chu Li.
Ye Wei and Eleven exchanged a glance, another force?
The same face appeared in their minds, was it Mo Ye and Mo Jue?
Within the Mafia, only they have enough appeal and are mysterious and unpredictable. Besides them, they can't think of anyone else who could have such courage. They should be men who are superior to Louis, and it doesn't make sense for them to obey him.
Everyone moved to the living room, and Xiao Naibao went to find Cheng Anya. She had just finished taking a bath, drank a cup of hot tea, felt warm all over, with a hint of pink on her cheeks, lying on the bed, looking thoughtfully at her fingers.
"Mommy..."
Xiao Naibao pushed open the door and walked in with a smile.
Cheng Anya came to her senses, squinted her eyes, and praised, "Sweetheart, you've got style."
This outfit, really exudes a strong presence, there is not a hint of childishness, the whole thing screams dangerous individual.
"Thank you for the compliment, mommy."
"Don't come closer, sit farther away, I'm afraid I can't help but punch you."
Cheng Anya pointed to the sofa opposite, "Sit over there."
Xiao Naibao glanced at Cheng Anya with resentment, "Mommy, do you despise me?"
"Correct."
Cheng Anya smiled and glanced at Xiao Naibao, feeling that there was something different about this child. Although he looked the same as before, a mother knows her child best. Whatever changes he may have, no matter how well hidden, she could sense them to some extent.
"Mommy, why are you looking at me like this? Do you think your baby looks handsome?"
Xiao Naibao mischievously blinked his eyes, looking extremely adorable.
Cheng Anya looked at him with a smile that was not quite a smile, "You've learned about eight or nine points of your daddy's narcissism. Are you okay recently? Tell mommy the truth. Have you been bullied?"
Xiao Naibao shook his head, "No."
"Nonsense, Louis showed me the photos, clearly covered in blood from being beaten."
Cheng Anya clearly didn't believe it, gritting her teeth, "He was tortured to death, I can't forgive it."
Remembering everything she had once experienced, Cheng Anya harbored extreme hatred towards Louis.
With a bright face veiled in a layer of coldness, the thought of Xiao Naibao's past experiences gave her an even worse premonition.
"Mommy, I'm really fine, most likely it's fabricated by him."
Xiao Naibao smiled elegantly, rolled up his sleeves, revealing a section of his fair and unblemished arm, "Look, not a single scar."
The gunshot wound on his arm had healed quite well, and soon, he was not afraid of Cheng Anya discovering it at all.
And the bruises he had suffered before were all left by Xunuo. Since it was Xunuo who had beaten him, he didn't feel bullied at all, but rather somewhat nostalgic for the pain she had inflicted on him back then.
If Nono could live, he would rather be beaten by her like this for the rest of his life.
"Ningning, are you really okay?"
Cheng Anya's brow furrowed, not missing the flicker of pain that passed through her son's eyes.
Xiao Naibao nodded, "I'm really fine, mommy, the ones who are in trouble are you and daddy. Uncle Heiying said there's a virus on you, how did daddy get infected too?"
Cheng Anya thought of the lustful Ye Sanshao, her cheeks blushing again. She lost the desire to even speak, "Don't mention it. Jumped out of a plane in the desert, jumped out at sea, how could we not have contact."
Miss Cheng spoke calmly, and Xiao Naibao had no doubts.
"Mommy, nothing will happen. Bai Ye's medical skills are so superb, he will definitely find a way to save you."
