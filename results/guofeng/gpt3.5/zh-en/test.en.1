Chapter 1064 The Doomsday of Arrow Corporation
Under the suppression of mortar fire, the base was in extreme chaos, and no one noticed that a special forces unit had infiltrated the camp.
With little effort, Kutbov placed a beacon on the designated target, then withdrew from the base with his team, safely reaching the evacuation point and calling in an airstrike.
Soon, Russian stealth bombers whistled past from above the clouds, dropping four cruise missiles that accurately hit two ammunition depots and two fuel depots inside the base.
The shockwave of the explosion swept through the entire camp, directly blowing down a circle of concrete buildings around it.
The exploding ammunition and burning fireballs flew horizontally in the camp, triggering a series of chain reactions, with flames everywhere, blood and corpses everywhere.
The guard brigade stationed in the camp was immediately decimated by nearly half, with most of the remaining personnel injured, making it almost impossible to find a complete person.
The medics carried stretchers through the base, searching for injured personnel who had lost their mobility.
The sappers, wearing heavy bomb suits, risked their lives to rush into the fire scene and dragged out the unexploded ammunition from the ruins.
The soldiers who were still able to move all started to search for their own teams to regroup.
Saldes stared at the fire outside the window, a layer of despair gradually reflected in his dull pupils.
Thick smoke shrouded the entire base, and the firelight dyed the entire night sky red, making it look like the end of the world.
"Shet..."
Muttering to himself, he moved his legs as if they were made of lead, slowly moving away from the window.
Turning around, he locked eyes with the staff at the command post.
"Sir, what should we do?"
The aftermath of the explosion finally subsided, and there were no longer sounds of ammunition exploding in the base. However, everyone's emotions could not calm down. The mercenaries who had escaped the explosion knew very well that the nightmare was just beginning for them.
The previous explosion seemed to have ignited a signal, sounding the horn of the Sami army's attack.
At Jiang Chen's command, Sami seized this fleeting opportunity, standing in front of everyone, raising their arms and shouting loudly, leading the remaining rebels to charge to the front line.
More than six thousand people ran on the mossy ground, charging towards the flickering firelight in the pine forest.
From a distance, the scene was truly spectacular.
At the same time, as they looked at the thick smoke rising from the base behind them, all the mercenaries fighting on the front line were plunged into panic, and their once high morale plummeted to rock bottom in an instant.
When facing the rebels rushing towards them like a tide, even if they had the strength to hold the line, they had no intention of continuing the fight.
Without any suspense, the defense line of Arrow Corporation was breached, and the stubborn mercenaries were completely routed in the face of the Sami army's overwhelming manpower tactics.
Some people fled back into the burning base, but most of them deserted and ran towards the depths of the forest.
There is no need for Jiang Chen to remind us, even a pig should know what to do at this moment.
Watching the Sami lead the rebels to attack the military base, Jiang Chen put away the binoculars in his hand, summoned a pre-prepared off-road motorcycle from the storage space, and gently patted Aisha's back.
"Almost done, let's set off as well."
"Mm!"
Aisha nodded in response, and after Jiang Chen got on the motorcycle, she swiftly sat behind him.
The engine roared as the tires kicked up a layer of snow.
Riding the off-road motorcycle down the hill, Jiang Chen, with Aisha behind him, circled around to the side of the base, parked the motorcycle by the roadside, pulled out a lightsaber from the storage space, casually gestured with it in his hand, effortlessly slicing through the steel wire mesh protective wall.
The entire base was engulfed in fire and chaos, with occasional mortar explosions echoing. All armed mercenaries rushed to the front line, vying with the rebels for control of the main entrance of the base.
Except for a guard brigade stationed in front of the command post, there were hardly any people left in the entire rear area.
For Jiang Chen and Aisha, this was no different from an undefended situation.
There were a total of ten guards, with two guards stationed on the watchtower and the remaining eight stationed at the entrances of the first and second floors.
Aisha took out the Ghost Sniper Rifle and silently took out the two guards stationed on the watchtower, then used blind spots in the line of sight to systematically eliminate the eight guards on the upper and lower floors.
After Aisha dealt with the guards outside the command post, Jiang Chen took out his rifle and walked towards the main gate. As he passed by the Humvee at the entrance, he coincidentally bumped into Saldes, who was rushing out in panic from the command post, along with the staff officers.
Meeting each other's gaze, both sides clearly paused for a moment.
The staff officer was the first to react, immediately reaching into his chest to draw his gun, but before his hand could touch his chest, Aisha, who reacted faster, shot him in the head.
Saldes was about to resist, but Jiang Chen easily controlled him, pinning his hands behind his back against the nearby Humvee.
"Saldes, male, 43 years old."
"I am the CEO of Arrow Corporation, as well as the Supreme Commander. Am I right?"
Although it was their first meeting, stored in the holographic helmet connected to the Phantom Agent database on Jiang Chen's head were his photo and personal information.
Just a glance, and information about him was projected onto the holographic screen.
His face pressed against the hood of the car, Saldes, to his credit, remained stubborn and refused to surrender, gritting his teeth as he spoke.
"I won't say anything, just go ahead and kill me..."
"Kill you?"
"I haven't even asked anything yet."
Jiang Chen grinned, not even bothering with his uncooperative attitude, and casually pulled out a syringe with his right hand, injecting it into his shoulder without hesitation.
"Ugh!"
A resistant roar escaped from his throat, Saldes stared with bloodshot eyes, but soon the light in his pupils dimmed.
Jiang Chen simply let go of the hand holding him, an ordinary person injected with a truth serum could still resist, there was simply no precedent for this.
Turning Saldes over, Jiang Chen asked slowly and deliberately.
"Where is Carmen?"
"The underground bunker...inside the research institute."
"Where is the underground bunker?"
"The entrance is in the center of the base, and can only be accessed through an elevator."
"Next to the entrance are two helipads, you will see them as you walk over."
With a question and answer, Jiang Chen quickly obtained the desired intelligence.
"Very well, now you can have your wish."
Jiang Chen pulled out a pistol and shot him in the head, then tossed his body aside.
This was a rather quick and painless way to die, but for the renowned Arrow Corporation CEO Mr. Saldes, dying in this silent and unnoticed manner may be more painful than death itself... if the dead can feel pain.
"An underground bunker?"
Looking towards the center of the base, a cold smile appeared on Jiang Chen's lips.
No matter what Carmen is plotting, his good luck should have run out.
The fate of the Rothschild family will end just as it began, with a war that rose to fame, and a war that quietly died out...
However, at this moment, a piercing and mournful scream came from afar.
