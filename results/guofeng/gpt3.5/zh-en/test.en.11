Chapter 834 Return to the Holy Land (Part 2)
"Zhuque."
Inside the bamboo house, Bai Yan was watching Bai Xiaochen and Xiao Long'er playing around, when suddenly she heard a commotion outside. Her eyebrows furrowed as she asked, "What's happening outside? Why is there a noisy commotion?"
"You go out and take a look."
Zhuque bowed slightly, took her leave, and after a while, she pushed open the bamboo house door and walked in, hesitantly saying, "Queen, there are two people outside looking for you..."
"Looking for me?"
Bai Yan raised her eyebrows, "Then I'll go out and take a look at who's looking for me."
As the words fell, she slowly stood up from the chair and walked towards the door.
Outside the house, under the blood-red sky, two people crawled shakily towards the front. Perhaps due to the long climb, a trail of blood flowed beneath them, catching Bai Yan's eyes with piercing intensity.
"What are you all doing?"
Bai Yan furrowed her brows and asked coldly.
The second elder's face was pale, his trembling body prostrated on the ground, shivering as he said, "Queen, I have come to apologize to you. It was my fault for believing in that impostor back then, which led to the Queen misunderstanding the King. It was all my fault, and I am willing to accept any punishment or scolding from you, please forgive me, Your Majesty."
"No, Your Majesty, it's my fault. I failed to bring the King's orders to you. In fact, the King left the palace to lift the seal of the demon realm that day. He asked me to come back and inform you, but I failed to do so, which gave the traitor an opportunity to take advantage."
Huo Yu knelt on the ground, tears streaming down his face: "Every mistake, big or small, is my fault. If the Queen wants to hit or scold me, I won't say a word." He took the bamboo stick behind him, held it in his hands, and presented it to Bai Yan, bowing deeply with a look of resigned acceptance on his face.
Bai Yan's hand slowly grasped the bamboo stick that Huo Yu dragged in front of her, her expression calm, with an incomprehensible light in her eyes.
As if sensing the bamboo stick leaving his hand, Huo Yu's body stiffened, he clenched his teeth tightly, waiting for the unstoppable blow to come.
However...
For a long time, there was no pain.
Huo Yu looked up in astonishment, only to see the bamboo stick in Bai Yan's hand burst into flames, instantly burning to ashes.
"You must have suffered a lot on your way crawling here, haven't you?"
"King... Queen?"
Huo Yu looked at Bai Yan in confusion, perhaps not understanding the meaning behind her words.
"If that's the case, then your sins have already been repaid in full. You may rise."
Bai Yan has always been a clear-headed person. She only targets those who wish to harm her.
Back then, she could be deceived, let alone the Second Elder and Huo Yu? Therefore, she has never blamed them...
Huo Yu's body stiffened like iron, unable to believe that Bai Yan let them off so easily?
Before coming, they were already prepared to be covered in bruises and wounds!
Nowadays, she didn't even hit them once, and yet she absolved them of their sins.
Seeing the two people kneeling motionless on the ground, Bai Yan's face slightly darkened: "What's wrong?"
"Are you still waiting for me to help you up?"
The woman's sharp voice fell into Huo Yu's ears, startling him to immediately get up from the ground. His pants were covered in blood, making it impossible for him to stand steadily.
And so, he still stood on the ground, even though his legs were trembling, he did not kneel down again.
Bai Yan looked at the two of them struggling to support themselves, pointed to the stone seat on the ground, and said, "Sit down, rest for a while, and then you can go down the mountain."
