Chapter 210: The Affairs of the Governor and the Empress Dowager 64
Xiaomo had a moment when her heart and mind were both moved, and she became sorrowful.
The Governor... dare not act.
Once the body moves, the mind also starts to work. He is so smart, how could he not know that Bai Weiwei is already dead.
He was unwilling to admit, and dared not think deeply. He could only force himself to sit there, convincing himself that Bai Weiwei was just sleeping and would wake up.
Xiaomo felt that only when Bai Weiwei's body began to decay, would the Governor truly regain his sanity and realize that the person he was holding hands with had been dead for a long time.
But strangely, Bai Weiwei's body showed no signs of decay.
Even her pale complexion had improved a lot, and although her body was cold, it was undoubtedly like she was just sleeping.
There were no signs of any features of a corpse.
Mu Yanjun was guarding her, his eyes becoming brighter and brighter.
Finally, the old quack doctor was brought in, munching on a heart-protecting pill, "I'm afraid I've already lost half of my old life."
Mu Yanjun has not slept for five days already, and anyone can see how exhausted he is.
But his whole person was exceptionally clear-headed, clear-headed in a terrifying and abnormal way.
"After I let her take the medicine, she fell asleep like this. I think it's time to ask you to come and take a look. When will she wake up?"
The old quack doctor sighed before walking to the bedside and checking Bai Weiwei's pulse.
"In fact, this phenomenon is extremely rare, there is no need for medical treatment, but there is one very important thing that still needs to be done..."
Mu Yanjun listened attentively, like a diligent student, with a fire burning in his eyes.
The old quack doctor's voice lowered, "It seems I have to treat another person again..."
Mu Yanjun leaned forward, unwilling to miss a word.
As a result, the old quack doctor's hands moved like lightning, and a needle instantly pierced into his neck.
Mu Yanjun's eyes suddenly widened, and his hand swiftly slapped towards the old quack doctor's head.
Xiaomo's hand stretched out horizontally, grabbing Mu Yanjun's attack.
With this back and forth, Mu Yanjun couldn't hold on any longer and passed out from dizziness.
The old quack doctor touched his head, "I almost died, but I probably won't live much longer. As long as he wakes up without going crazy, that's considered good."
Bai Weiwei cannot be saved.
And Mu Yanjun's condition is simply heart-wrenching, with all his internal organs experiencing issues.
Not eating, not sleeping, not thinking, not moving, no different from the living dead, if he continues like this for another two days, he probably will end up like Bai Weiwei.
Xiaomo looked at the old quack doctor and said, "If you fail to protect my Governor again this time, I will personally kill you."
After saying that, she turned around and walked towards the place where they were being punished, silently accepting her punishment.
The old quack doctor sighed, "No wonder my master used to say, even selling sweet potatoes can't be considered a divine doctor. Everyone treats me like a god, but even a god can't make someone who wants to die stay alive."
Mu Yanjun only slept for two hours before opening his eyes.
He was startled, his eyes showing rare panic, but he found himself unable to move.
The old quack doctor saw him wake up, "I gave you an injection, but your spirit is weakened. I'll give you some care, and then you should go meet the King of Hell."
Mu Yanjun's eyes darkened, his face pale and haggard, yet exuding a chilling aura that made people shudder.
The old quack doctor gave him another injection, "I didn't want to save you originally, after all, someone as cruel and malicious as you, if I save you, who knows how chaotic the world will become."
Mu Yanjun's voice was soft and eerie, "Let go of me."
The old quack doctor shook his head, "I can't save the person in your heart, saving you will be considered compensation."
Mu Yanjun suddenly laughed bitterly, "You can't repay it, how could you possibly repay it? Even if you save everyone in the world, you can't repay her with a single strand of hair."
