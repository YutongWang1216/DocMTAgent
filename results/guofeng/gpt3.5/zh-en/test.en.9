Chapter 70: Lord of Donglai Cave (Eight)
This is exactly what Song Fu and the others wanted to ask, but someone else asked first. They looked at each other, not knowing what to do or how to answer.
Miao Yi immediately flew towards the place where the loud noise came from, and Yan Xiu and the other two immediately followed.
Song Fu and the others glanced at each other and followed to see what was going on.
When everyone arrived at the entrance of the mountain gate, they saw under the moonlight, the stone archway engraved with the three characters 'Donglai Cave' had already been shattered on the ground, shocking everyone. It turned out that someone had destroyed the mountain gate of Donglai Cave.
Miao Yi suddenly turned around, looking at Song Fu and the others with a fierce expression, sneering, "Alright!"
"I just arrived today, it seems that someone is eager to show their authority in front of me!"
"Very well!"
Song Fu and the others were stunned, they understood the meaning behind the words, but this was definitely not something they did, because they were just sitting together chatting and discussing how to teach Miao Yi a lesson, and only came out when they heard the unusual sound.
Several people initially suspected whether Miao Yi was behind it, but seeing Miao Yi's current demeanor, they felt that there was no need for Miao Yi to smash his own mountain gate to show his authority. After all, Miao Yi is the cave master of Donglai Cave, and being vandalized right after taking office is quite embarrassing.
This kind of thing must be clarified, otherwise if it escalates, we won't be able to bear this responsibility. Song Fu said seriously while clasping his fists, "Cave Master, this matter is definitely not something we did!"
The other few people also clasped their fists to assure, seemingly treating Miao Yi as the cave master for the first time.
"Sophistry!"
Miao Yi stared at Song Fu and sternly said, "I just appointed you to guard the mountain gate today, and you don't know if someone destroyed it?"
"Could it be that you deliberately let water in?"
"This..."
Song Fu struggled to find his words, he never intended to be here in the first place, so it was hard to say that he didn't regard you, the Cave Master, at all, which is why he wasn't here. He could only clasp his fists and honestly explain, "Master, you just arrived and may not be aware of the situation. The servants from Donglai City have not yet arrived, so we have been handling our own food and drink. In order to fill our stomachs, I temporarily left for a moment, never expecting such an incident to occur."
Wang Zifa and the others also clasped their fists one after another, confirming, "Cave Master, we can testify that Senior Brother Song Fu was just eating with us a moment ago."
Miao Yi pointed at the fallen archway and sternly said, "Are you telling me that it fell down by itself? Don't you dare tell me that it was blown down by the wind!"
Song Fu felt like he was being forced to swallow a bitter pill and had to raise his hand, saying, "Cave Master, I can swear to the ancestors of my Blue Jade Gate that this is definitely not something we did. If I speak a single false word, may I, Song Fu, have a wretched death!"
Miao Yi's gaze flickered unpredictably over the crowd, his tone dark as he asked, "Is someone causing trouble in my Donglai Cave?"
Everyone was shocked by the possibility and quickly looked around.
"What are you waiting for here? Do you want to be attacked in your sleep?"
"Hurry up and spread out to search!"
Miao Yi angrily said.
Yan Xiu and the other two immediately clasped their fists in agreement, then quickly spread out into the surrounding mountains and forests.
"Hmm?"
Miao Yi snorted heavily, his gaze fixed on Song Fu and the others, seemingly questioning why, if it wasn't them, they didn't go search, as if they knew something?
At this point, everyone had to show that they had nothing to do with it. Song Fu immediately turned around and shouted, "Obey the Cave Master's orders and go search!"
Everyone clasped their fists towards Miao Yi and immediately dispersed.
However, Song Fu was stopped by Miao Yi, "Song Fu, come with me!"
Song Fu hesitated for a moment, clasped his fists in agreement, and followed behind Miao Yi.
After everyone left, a phantom figure resembling a person in water appeared in the same spot, and it was none other than the stunning and peerless figure of Old Bai.
Old Bai looked at the fallen stone archway, shook his head slightly, and smiled, "Life is like a chess game, how can a passionate man only have the courage of a commoner!"
"I have always been worried that you, this kid, are too kind-hearted and easily taken advantage of... A man should have his own way of doing things, mere rough men find it hard to rise to the top, but now I am much more at ease."
With those words, the entire figure swayed like water ripples, quietly disappearing without a trace in the swaying motion.
In the flickering light of the candles in the Donglai Hall, Song Fu stood behind Miao Yi, both of them standing in the hall. Outside, the guards had already stood up, as if sensing something, one of them even sneezed.
Miao Yi stared expressionlessly at his own throne, standing with his hands behind his back, facing away from Song Fu, not saying a word.
The atmosphere between the two was a bit tense, and after waiting for a while, Song Fu couldn't help but ask, "Cave Master, why did you summon me?"
Miao Yi's tone was dark as he said, "Song Fu, do you know your guilt?"
Song Fu's mouth curled in a mocking smile, glancing at the food and wine on the low table beside him, and calmly said, "This matter is definitely not something we did. What guilt does Song Fu have?"
"I'm not asking about that!"
Miao Yi suddenly turned around, staring at him, and coldly asked word by word, "I ordered you to guard the mountain gate, why did you leave your post without authorization? Could it be that you do not regard my orders as the Cave Master?"
Song Fu thought to himself, what do you think?
It was never taken seriously.
Of course, he wouldn't say that, "Song Fu has already reported to the Cave Master. I had no choice but to leave temporarily to satisfy my hunger. I also don't want to see such things happen."
Miao Yi asked, "Do you think the Cave Master and the Mountain Master will believe your explanation after I report this matter to them?"
Song Fu chuckled and said, "People have two mouths, if the Cave Master insists on falsely accusing me, then go ahead, but don't forget, I also have a mouth to defend myself, I am not mute."
Miao Yi sneered, "Looks like you really are unrepentant!"
As soon as this was said, Yan Xiu, Shan Biaoyi, and Qiu Shaoqun appeared outside the door together, walked in, and clasped their fists to Miao Yi, saying, "Cave Master, we have not found any suspicious individuals for the time being."
Miao Yi said, "The suspicious person is right in front of us, how can you say you have not found anyone!"
Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun seemed to have received a signal, quickly flashed and closed the palace door.
Song Fu was startled by the sound, quickly turned around, only to see the deathly Yan Xiu wielding a pair of broadaxes angrily coming towards him.
Song Fu quickly drew his personal sword, a cold light flashed as it unsheathed, swiftly clashing to defend himself.
Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun also almost instantaneously brandished their spears and joined forces to attack Song Fu.
Yan Xiu and Song Fu were evenly matched in their cultivation levels, with Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun joining forces, Song Fu's situation instantly became precarious.
"Shameless scoundrel!"
"How dare you plot to harm..."
Surrounded and unable to escape, Song Fu, who was barely holding his ground with Yan Xiu in a fierce battle, had not finished his desperate roar when two spears, thrusting desperately, pierced through his magical defense and plunged deeply into his chest.
Song Fu widened his eyes and tried hard to turn his head to look at Miao Yi, trembling lips unable to describe the anger in his eyes.
He finally understood that this was a trap, the collapse of the mountain gate was not only to frame him, but also to transfer his fellow disciples away, in order to prevent him from joining forces with them to resist, the main purpose was to take his life.
