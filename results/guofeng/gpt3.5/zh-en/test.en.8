Chapter 455: Reversal 3
"This is just to let you feel the fluctuation of the aura, it's really simple." Another sorcerer beside him couldn't help but interject with a smile.
"Thank you for your help."
Lin Sheng nodded.
He needed to find the other fragments as quickly as possible, originally intending to deal with more evil spirits to obtain more pure soul power from the government.
But now that he has encountered such an opportunity, the fastest way to get it is the best approach.
Soon, the Warlock Chief led Lin Sheng to a place in front of an evil spirit.
The two reached out and lightly touched the edge of the evil spirit door frame at the same time, closing their eyes.
The Warlock Chief quickly used his supernatural powers to begin constructing a spatial foundation, establishing it as coordinates.
Then, following the ritual fluctuations of the evil spirit door, Lin Sheng's perceptual consciousness was carried along and together they were emitted by the ritual fluctuations.
"The normal teleportation portal ritual is a point-to-point directional teleportation."
"But when we explore other spatial mysteries, we transform this point-to-point into point-to-multipoint."
"This only requires a slight modification of the parameters on the teleportation base."
While guiding Lin Sheng's consciousness, the Warlock Chief also imparts relevant skills.
"In this way, the evil spirit door will spontaneously transport our consciousness to multiple possible locations similar to the target space."
"This is actually using energy to take chances. If we are lucky, we can immediately encounter the spatial mysteries we want. If we are unlucky, we will have to waste more energy and try several times."
"Indeed, it is quite random."
Lin Sheng was speechless.
As soon as his perception entered the evil spirit door, it was immediately enveloped by the ritual fluctuations within, and then emitted outward.
At the same time, he seemed to have split his consciousness, dividing his perceptual consciousness into more than ten parts, simultaneously perceiving the completely different spatial auras of more than ten spaces.
"In general, it is difficult for our consciousness to maintain integrity during the transmission process, so we can only try to remember the spatial coordinates that the main consciousness has come into contact with."
"The memory of coordinates requires us to leave a simple mark...."
Outside, the Warlock Chief was still explaining in a low voice, while guiding Lin Sheng and teaching him how to make a simple mark to determine the coordinate code.
But he never expected that, due to the incredibly strong and resilient nature of the consciousness soul of the Spirit Lock, after being split apart, he was able to remember the coordinates of all the spaces touched by the more than ten consciousness fragments.
It's just a matter of dividing the mind into more than ten parts. For Lin Sheng, who can use his soul consciousness in multiple ways, it's nothing special. He practices the skill of using his mind for dozens of tasks every day.
He can observe and control each summoned creature through his split consciousness soul. So even though he cannot currently control many summoned creatures independently at the same time.
But merely remembering the fluctuations of aura waves and setting coordinates separately.
In addition, his soul is inherently more resilient than the average person, and has a longer existence time. This makes it all the more effortless.
Ten minutes later, his consciousness depleted and dissipated.
Lin Sheng opened his eyes and looked at the Warlock Chief and the others.
"Locate the spatial mystery of this coordinate for me." He immediately, under the stunned gaze of the Warlock Chief and others, revealed the coordinates of a particular spatial mystery.
The spatial mystery of this coordinate is precisely the special space that Lin Sheng sensed, which shares the same origin as the fragment of the Yin Reversal Evil Wheel in his arms.
"Will it succeed on the first try?"
The Warlock Chief felt a bit bitter in his heart. The first time he sensed the spatial aura, confirmed the coordinates, and recorded them, it took him more than half a month to accomplish.
"It's a very simple operation."
"Let's begin, establish the teleportation portal."
"I want to go over there," Lin Sheng ordered.
"Yes."
"Wait, my original body."
The soul transmission of Tiangong Xia made Lin Sheng pause in his movements.
"What's wrong?"
He watched as the Warlock Chief and others began ordering the evil spirits to move the material resources over, while walking to the side to wait, communicating with Tiangong Xia through soul transmission in his mind.
"There's a situation over here. It's a big change compared to the situation on the island of Bisha."
Tiangong Xia's tone was somewhat solemn.
This is a sign that Lin Sheng has never seen before.
It should be noted that even when he told Tiangong Xia about the existence of the King of the Night, he had never seen her so serious.
This made him feel a hint of unusual tension.
"Mi Yue should be in an absolute disadvantage, right?"
Lin Sheng furrowed his brows and asked.
"Or is it that new forces have joined?"
"No, it's not new forces," Tiangong Xia said solemnly.
"It's Mi Yue who deceived everyone!"
"What's going on?"
"The Seven Locks Tower has long been successfully summoned, Mi Yue deceived everyone in the three major mysteries, he has long successfully summoned Farudo! Using himself as a sacrifice! And merged with it!"
Lin Sheng's consciousness immediately paused.
"Using himself as a sacrifice?"
"...this lunatic!"
"So, now the three major mysteries are facing a fusion monster of Mi Yue and Farudo...."
Lin Sheng was speechless.
"What should we do now?"
Tiangong Xia said solemnly.
The fusion of Farudo and Mi Yue is not a simple addition of one plus one, but an outcome of three multiplied by ten.
"Don't get excited."
"For Mi Yue and Farudo, their greatest enemies are still the three major mysteries and many other powerful forces."
"And this world is not as simple as you think."
Lin Sheng thought of the information he had previously investigated and obtained.
"The Great Star Pool, as well as those who possess the Celestial Destiny Sacred Artifacts, are not simple characters."
"As long as he doesn't provoke us, we can't be bothered with how they develop."
"I understand what you mean."
"However, it's best to be prepared early." Tiangong Xia reminded.
"I once had that level of destructive power. It was during the period when I was being controlled by the Magic Sword."
"So I am very clear on what kind of results that level of power can lead to."
Lin Sheng fell silent.
Among all his subordinates, Tiangong Xia is the most special one. This is because Tiangong Xia has been influenced and controlled by a certain unique and powerful entity in the past.
At that time, even in her memory retracing, she still discovered Lin Sheng's gaze.
Just a mere imprint of an image in memory, yet it can still discover Lin Sheng who is peering into memories.
Such power has already exceeded Lin Sheng's understanding.
"I got it." Lin Sheng replied once again.
"I will be prepared."
"Don't worry."
In the worst case, I can activate the strongest special state, summoning all commanding powers and merging them into myself.
Breaking the connection with Tiangong Xia, Lin Sheng silently stared at the newly constructed evil spirit door. His thoughts returned to their original direction.
"Open it. Your Majesty," the Warlock Chief whispered.
Lin Sheng stared at the teleportation portal in silence for a moment.
"Summon the Fairy King. Also, Dejia Er!"
Dejia Er's magical hand had long been waiting nearby.
Upon hearing the summons, he immediately walked in from the doorway.
"Your Majesty, I will obey your orders."
Lin Sheng nodded.
"I want to simultaneously open multiple teleportation gates and explore multiple evil spirit spaces."
"You select one hundred great evil spirits, divide them into different numbered teams, and explore separately as a trial."
"Understood!"
Dejia Er's magical hand felt a chill in his heart, knowing that His Majesty had probably encountered a turning point.
Otherwise, there wouldn't be such a sudden and urgent large-scale exploration.
