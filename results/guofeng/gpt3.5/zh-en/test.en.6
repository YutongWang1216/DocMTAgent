Chapter 437: Hit a snag
At this moment, as the Blue Silver Golden Light Array emerged, the flame dimmed momentarily, being drawn downwards and guided.
However, the Fire Gourd was obviously not easy to deal with. It suddenly exerted force to suck upwards, actually taking away a portion of the flame. Then with a "whoosh," it shot to the side and broke out of the Blue Silver Golden Light Array.
These rapid changes happened so quickly, giving people a sense of being unable to keep up with them.
Not easy to deal with! This person.
We must take it down as soon as possible, otherwise the enforcers will arrive.
The Fire Gourd spewed downwards, and the woman appeared again, her eyes filled with killing intent, "What are you doing?"
Just as she spoke, a flash of golden light appeared under her feet, and a beautiful pattern quietly emerged, causing the woman's body to stiffen instantly.
Tang Wulin's Blue Silver Grass wrapped around, Ye Xinglan pointed the Star God Sword towards the opponent's chest, while Xie Xie silently arrived behind her, the Light Dragon Dagger aimed at her neck.
It's all a set-up!
What could be better than Xu Xiaoyan's Starlight Chains to deal with a single opponent?
The absolute effectiveness of the Starlight Chains is truly extraordinary!
Just as everyone breathed a sigh of relief, thinking they had defeated their opponent, a sudden change occurred! The Star God Sword had already arrived in front of them, while the sharpness of the Light Dragon Dagger behind them had reached their neck. In the face of a life-threatening situation, the woman's eyes suddenly lit up.
A loud phoenix cry rang out from her, followed by an unparalleled surge of soul power bursting out from within her body. As if stimulated by something, under her clothes, circles of bright red light shone, forming what appeared to be halos around her neck, shoulders, elbows, waist, knees, and other areas. In the instant these bright red lights appeared, an incredibly powerful soul force suddenly erupted from the woman.
Much stronger than before, the soul power surged, transforming into a huge ring of fire that surged out. A dense layer of golden patterns appeared on the floating Fire Gourd in the air, causing the originally one-foot-tall Fire Gourd to directly rise to two feet, several times larger.
The powerful fire elemental fluctuations erupted instantly, violently impacting and sending Tang Wulin and the others flying out. Moreover, the flames burned their soul power like maggots on their bones.
The phoenix cry became even more resounding, and the woman exuded a majestic aura, followed by swiftly appearing dark red armor pieces covering her whole body.
On her head was a phoenix helmet, covering her head, with dark red armor extending to the sides, gracefully flowing downward in an arc, outlining feminine features. Soft lines covered her shoulders, extending to cover her entire arms.
Dark red flame patterns covered the armor, with a golden-red phoenix pattern on the chest plate. The armor itself was not particularly magnificent, but when covered in this set of armor, the woman's aura had already elevated several levels.
Tang Wulin blurted out, his face already filled with a bitter smile.
Battle armor, yes, this is battle armor! Judging from its complexity and aura fluctuations, it should be a word battle armor. The circles of light surrounding the woman are tools for storing battle armor.
A single-word battle armor cannot yet be integrated into the body of a battle armor master.
But even so, this is a complete set of single-word battle armor!
Meaning that the woman, originally at the five-ringed cultivation level, had her strength directly elevated to the seven-ringed realm.
Yan Feng was very angry at this moment. She was in a particularly good mood and very happy today. Just now, she went to the Heavenly Spirit Tower to register and officially became a single-word battle armor master.
Battle armor masters are top-tier figures that any organization is willing to support. Just when she signed the contract, the Heavenly Spirit Tower promised her a series of welfare policies. At only twenty-seven years old, she is one of the youngest battle armor masters in Tianling City, with a boundless future ahead.
The Heavenly Spirit Tower has already promised to assist her with abundant resources in the future, helping her advance to become a double-word battle armor master. Once she becomes a double-word battle armor master, she will truly be recognized as a battle armor master and will have a place in the entire continent.
But who would have thought that just as she left the Heavenly Spirit Tower in high spirits, she was immediately surrounded and attacked by this group of young kids.
Moreover, their abilities are quite strong, and if they hadn't used their battle armor, they would have really been in trouble just now.
She was unaware that Tang Wulin and his team had no malicious intent. The Star God Sword and the Light Dragon Dagger made her feel the threat of death.
At this moment, the voice of Wu Changkong rang in the ears of Tang Wulin and the other five, "As long as you defeat her, this city will consider you to have passed the test."
Tang Wulin's mouth twitched slightly, Teacher Wu, oh Teacher Wu, you also have a dark side!
This is a complete one-word Battle Armor Master, equivalent to a powerful individual at the seven-ringed Soul Saint level. Can we really win against her?
Before he could think too much, Yan Feng had already made her move. A surge of powerful soul power instantly rose, pointing her right hand towards Tang Wulin. The Fire Gourd above her head immediately spewed out a line of fire, which reached Tang Wulin in an instant.
At this point, we can only give it a try and fight it out. There's no point in explaining anymore. Just by looking at her eyes, you can tell she's already been provoked.
They are not in the right in this matter! Let's deal with it first before discussing.
Tang Wulin took a deep breath, and the three purple soul rings on his body suddenly disappeared, replaced by golden light rings that shimmered. His right arm swelled as golden dragon scales spread, while at the same time, bright star lines quickly condensed in his right hand, and the battle armor gauntlet emerged.
How can he not go all out against a true battle armor master!
"Battle armor?"
Yan Feng was also shocked when she saw the battle armor on Tang Wulin's right hand. In her mind, the first thing that came up was, it's impossible to have three words!
How old is he?
Moreover, she clearly saw that Tang Wulin's battle armor emerged directly from his body. Could it be that his battle armor is a two-word battle armor?
Although it's just a piece of battle armor, to have battle armor at this age is simply unimaginable.
When she first acquired her first piece of battle armor, she was already twenty-one years old, and she was still considered a genius.
After years of diligent practice, she finally became a true single-word battle armor master.
How old are these little guys in front of us?
As Tang Wulin made his move, the others also quickly sprang into action.
Xu Lizhi had already retreated far before, without saying much, one by one, buns flew out of his hands, with delicate Xiaolongbao and bloodthirsty red bean buns, each person holding one.
Tang Wulin placed two buns behind his left hand, already caught, and without hesitation, he stuffed them into his mouth.
We must resolve this quickly.
Even if it's just a single-word battle armor, after collecting the complete set, it also has the ability to help Soul Masters quickly recover soul power.
There is no chance for them in a prolonged battle against the opponent.
With a forceful stomp of his left foot on the ground, a loud "boom" resounded as Tang Wulin shot up like a copper arrow, his right arm blocking in front of him. The blood in his body boiled and surged, the aura of the Golden Dragon King burst forth, his eyes completely turned golden, and the intense blood and energy fluctuations emanating from his body were filled with a fierce taste.
His right hand's Golden Dragon Claw blocked in front of him, directly confronting the opponent's flames, resisting the forward charge.
As the team captain and a power-type battle spirit master, he absolutely cannot retreat now. Only by holding the front line can his teammates have a chance.
Stimulated by the Bloodthirsty Mung Bean Bag, his own soul power and blood energy instantly peaked, and his entire skin showed faint golden scales, with the scales on his right hand, right arm, and right chest particularly dazzling.
Is he a twin martial soul?
Yan Feng was momentarily stunned.
"Hmph!"
She didn't dodge at all, as the Fire Gourd above her head suddenly began to spin. The original line of fire turned into a large burst of flames, sweeping over Tang Wulin's head and covering towards his teammates, blocking the others.
She wanted to isolate Tang Wulin and deal with this clearly the leader of the other side's little guy first.
The Golden Dragon Claw swiftly arrived in front of the opponent, while Yan Feng's right hand also lifted up, forming a fist to directly confront.
As the two sides were about to collide, the dragon chant within Tang Wulin's body suddenly became more intense, and a huge golden dragon head with a diameter of over two feet appeared without warning, directly swallowing Yan Feng's right arm.
Golden Dragon Shocking the Heavens!
After eating the Red Jade Shrimp that day, although Tang Wulin's own blood and energy did not break through the fourth seal of the Golden Dragon King, there was still a significant improvement, making him more proficient in controlling the Golden Dragon Shocking the Heavens.
Yan Feng was also startled, feeling a strong force coming directly at her. Immediately after, her punch was engulfed as if by being swallowed, and the Golden Dragon Claw, like a large clamp, grabbed onto her right hand.
The Golden Dragon Claw exerted force, causing the single-word battle armor on Yan Feng's body to light up completely. All the flame patterns on it seemed to come alive, especially the fire phoenix on her chest, which actually moved and transformed into a phoenix-shaped fire shadow, heading straight towards Tang Wulin's chest.
