Chapter One: A New Journey
The strong wind blows through the canyon, stirring up waves on the grassland.
The wild buffalo, which was bowing its head and nibbling on the tender grass leaves, raised its head and looked towards the sky.
There, a wooden merchant ship tens of meters long was floating in the air, its full sail billowing in the wind, slowly moving forward.
"Whenever you look at it, this tide is always so spectacular."
The middle-aged man in leather armor stood by the deck, looking down at the endless grassland and beautiful scenery below.
"For us merchants, this is also a rare business opportunity."
Standing next to the middle-aged man is a slightly overweight merchant with a strange curly hair, wearing a merchant's robe. His two small eyes were slightly squinted, as if calculating something, staring at the scenery in front of him. Judging by his appearance, it seems like even this beautiful scenery in front of him could be sold for money.
"If it weren't for it, I'm afraid we wouldn't be able to transport the goods to the central region so quickly."
"To be honest, when I first decided to expand this market, I faced opposition, but now it seems that my choice was indeed the right one."
"But, please forgive me for being frank, you did not choose the major waterway, but instead chose to go from here. Although it will save time, the level of danger will also increase."
"I heard that the other side is not peaceful recently. And, I believe you have also been reminded by the captain that there have been recent sightings of wind serpents nearby, in case..."
The man's expression became somewhat serious, he turned his head and cast his gaze towards the nearby mountains.
The towering peaks blocked his line of sight, making it impossible to see what was behind them.
But faintly visible, in the distant sky, it was not pure azure, but with a touch of gloomy darkness.
That is not the world they should step into.
"Don't worry, there aren't that many 'in case' situations. Fortune favors the bold, that's why I paid such a high price to hire you!"
"Just a few snakes, right?"
The merchant reached out and patted the man's shoulder.
"Oh, by the way, how is that young man we rescued doing now?"
"He's not dead yet."
"Lijie has bandaged his wounds, and he is currently in a coma, so there shouldn't be any life-threatening danger."
"That's good."
Satisfied with the man's response, the merchant nodded in approval, but soon after, he furrowed his brow.
"But, what kind of injury did that young man actually suffer? From that wound, it looks a lot like a large lizard - but do such strange things exist in the north of Pafilde?"
"I'm not sure either, sir, but it should be a very fierce wild beast. Hopefully, we won't encounter it."
With that, the man subconsciously glanced at the entrance to the cabin, then he turned his head back and looked ahead.
Rode opened his eyes.
What happened?
He stared blankly at the ceiling in front of him, his mind heavy and muddled.
He remembered that he had previously led a team to battle the most powerful boss, the Void Dragon, on a high platform in the ruins and successfully obtained the first kill. He confirmed that he received achievements and system prompts, but then, the final blow from the Void Dragon also took his life.
Originally according to the original plan, Rode should have revived in the graveyard and then logged out offline.
But at the moment when he was killed by the Void Dragon, the whole world immediately turned pitch black, as if forcibly isolated, and then Rode lost consciousness.
How is this possible?
Could it be that there is a problem with the game?
Rode barely turned his head and could see the blue sky and white clouds outside the window. Where was he?
Where is this place?
What exactly happened?
Is he still dreaming?
Am I still in the game?
At least Rode can be sure that the place he is in now is definitely not his small rented apartment.
With this in mind, doubts immediately surged in Rode's mind, he furrowed his brow, and then tried to sit up.
"Woo!!!"
And at that moment, a huge pain suddenly came from Rode's chest, he gritted his teeth and stopped moving.
And at this moment, Rode finally realized that his left shoulder and chest had been completely wrapped in bandages. Although he didn't know what had happened, judging from the oozing bloodstains on them, it was obvious that he was seriously injured.
This is definitely not a game!
Rode could be sure of one thing, that even though technology is quite advanced now, and Dragon Soul Continent, as the world's first virtual reality online game, also employs a lot of high-tech technology. But according to the rules, players should not be able to experience pain, this is to help people distinguish between reality and the game, while also considering lowering the threshold for players.
And when players are injured, instead of pain, the game will use methods such as slowing down the player's movement speed and obstructing the field of vision with a representation of danger in red to warn and remind the player in a series of ways to disrupt normal gameplay, rather than truly simulating pain.
This behavior caused quite a controversy in society when holographic simulation technology first appeared, and the operating company of Dragon Soul Continent naturally could not be unaware of this.
Rode lowered his head, staring at his right hand, which was not the character he had created in the game, not the body filled with muscles and wildness.
On the contrary, the arm in front of him was slender and weak, with a sickly pale complexion due to not being exposed to the sun for years.
This is his own body in reality, and he is very clear about this.
But how did I get injured?
And besides, this doesn't seem like a hospital either, does it?
Rode looked up, and the entire room seemed to be like a cabin, with no lights, no phone, and certainly no call bell.
A wooden table, two chairs, and a cabinet fixed to the wall are all the furnishings here.
For some reason, Rode felt like he had seen this scene somewhere before.
And as Rode carefully examined the room, the door suddenly opened.
A blonde girl in a white robe walked into the room, looking at Rode, who was half sitting up, with widened eyes in surprise.
"You're awake? That's great!!"
The girl was not speaking Chinese or English, but Rode could clearly understand what she was saying.
This surprised Rode, as he knew this language.
This is Nim language, one of the official languages of Dragon Soul Continent!
"How do you feel? Are you okay?"
However, the girl paid no attention to Rode's expression, she quickly walked to Rode's side and carefully examined his left shoulder and chest.
"Your injury is really serious. To be honest, I'm a bit worried if you can hold on..."
"This is......"
Rode furrowed his brow, unsure of what to say. He turned his head and looked at the mirror on the wall next to him, where his face was clearly reflected. It was indeed his face, but it shouldn't be here.
"Have you forgotten?"
The blonde girl blinked her eyes in confusion, her ponytails on both sides swaying slightly with her movements, her deep blue eyes clear and transparent, giving off a lively feeling.
"Two days ago, you collapsed in the Pafilud Mountain Plain, and suffered quite serious injuries."
"If it wasn't for the cargo ship of the 'Silver Libra' Merchant Guild passing by, things would have been quite dire."
"I really don't know what you were fighting against, your left side suffered quite serious injuries, it was really dangerous at that time."
Wait, the left shoulder?
Rode was stunned for a moment, and he immediately remembered that during his final battle with the Void Dragon, wasn't it his left side that was attacked?
But that was the character in the game getting injured, which shouldn't have anything to do with the player themselves, right? Yet now, it is he himself who is injured?
Although the situation in front of him was chaotic, Rode quickly calmed down. This was due to his mental resilience as a top player and the leader of the world's most powerful online gaming guild.
During the conversation with the blonde girl in front of him, Rode also learned about his current situation. He was seriously injured and collapsed in the middle of the Pafilud Plain, and it was the Silver Libra Merchant Guild's floating ship that happened to pass by and rescue him.
According to the blonde girl, Rode's initial condition was very grim, but his recovery ability is actually quite good.
"My name is Lily Noyelu, a member of the Star Moon Mercenary Group, a spirit master. Just call me Lily."
The girl straightforwardly introduced herself to Rode.
"My name is Rode. Elant."
Although he had not yet figured out the situation in front of him, Rode hesitated for a moment and still reported his identity and ID in the game.
"Coming from the Eastern Mountain Plains, he is an adventurer."
"Adventurer, I see, that's why you were alone in such a remote deep mountain."
Upon hearing Rode's response, Lijie was not surprised, because on this continent, many adventurers like to explore alone, so the identity Rode reported is not a big issue.
"However, what exactly were you fighting against?"
“Why did you suffer such serious injuries?”
"I remember that in this plain area, there shouldn't be any particularly terrifying monsters, right?"
Upon hearing the girl's question, Rode smiled awkwardly.
What could he say, should he tell Lijie that he was injured while fighting the Void Dragon, one of the so-called Five Dragons of Creation?
"Because I was attacked at night, so I didn't see clearly what the other party was, there were many of them, and they were fast. I think, maybe it's something from 'over there'."
"I understand."
Although Rode did not elaborate, Lijie nodded as if she understood something, then she carefully examined Rode's wound before standing up.
"You haven't eaten for two days, you must be very hungry, please wait, I'll go get some food for you right away."
"Oh, right, I also need to report this to the guild leader. I think he will come to see you soon."
After saying these words, the girl politely nodded slightly to Rode, then turned and walked out of the room.
