Chapter 805 The Last Story
"In the East Campus?"
Zhou Tu hesitated for a moment. Both seniors and teachers had warned freshmen not to approach the East Campus. They did not specify the reasons, but the tone of their speech indicated that the East Campus was very dangerous.
"You have a deep misunderstanding of the East Campus. In fact, it is similar to here, but the management styles of the two campuses are completely different. They live in real horror, while you live in false happiness."
Chen Ge looked into Zhou Tu's eyes and said, "Compared to you, they are actually closer to hope because they at least know who they are and how to break free."
Chen Ge did not deceive Zhou Tu. Whether students from the East Campus or the West Campus, they are all trapped in this school.
The students from the West Campus have their memories altered, repeating the life created by the hidden hand behind the scenes, while the students from the East Campus at least know to look for scapegoats and find a way to leave.
"Are the students from the East Campus closer to hope?"
"But I heard that only the unwanted trash from the West Campus would be sent there."
Zhou Tu had been persuaded, but he still felt uneasy in his heart.
"No matter what the criteria for judgment are, any school that treats students as trash must be a garbage school."
Chen Ge pointed to the tall wall between the two campuses and asked, "Do you know why that wall exists?"
"Why?"
"Because the school is afraid of losing control, they use various methods to reshape human nature, but they forget that human nature is the most complex thing in the world."
"The incident has already happened, no matter how hard you try to forget, the wounds left behind will always be branded on the heart."
"Not remembering anything does not mean they do not exist, so some plans of this school are destined to fail."
Chen Ge said some words that the members of the club did not understand. They did not know why Chen Ge said this, but they felt that what Chen Ge said seemed to make some sense.
The children's curiosity itself is heavy, and Chen Ge keeps telling them the truth about this school, finally successfully arousing the interest of the club members.
"Should we go over there now?"
"To be honest, I really don't believe that there would be the art studio of my dreams in the East Campus," Zhou Tu said quietly.
"It's not the right time yet."
Chen Ge turned around and glanced at the shadow. The dark figure in Room 413 was still asleep, but his body had undergone significant changes.
If you look closely, you will find that Chen Ge's shadow is different from others, pitch-black like ink, as if all light shining there would be swallowed up.
It seems to have become much stronger.
The potential of the dark figure is enormous, which is a good thing for Chen Ge. When he wakes up, Chen Ge will lead the students back to the East Campus to search for the lone ghost again.
By doing so, one can enhance their own strength, and at the same time, stir up the stagnant water of the school, providing cover for another "culprit" in the institution.
"It is still a stage of accumulating strength now. Before the owner of the school discovers this little bug of mine, I need to prepare as many trump cards for myself as possible."
Chen Ge turned to look at Wang Yicheng. He already knew the stories of the other three club members, leaving only the limping boy who was the first to join the club: "The next place we are going to is Wang Yicheng's dormitory."
"Go to my dormitory?"
Wang Yicheng's reaction was a bit strange after hearing this, he repeatedly waved his hands: "Let's forget about it, there's nothing interesting in the dormitory I live in."
"When you said this sentence, your voice was louder than usual, your speech speed increased, and your eyes were wandering. You really are not good at lying, child."
Chen Ge gently put his arm around Wang Yicheng's shoulder, "Why don't you want us to come over?"
"What are you worried we'll see?"
"I..."
Wang Yicheng thought for a long time and didn't know how to respond. Finally, he turned his gaze in another direction and said, "It's nothing, let's just go over there directly."
"Okay."
Wang Yicheng lives in Room 413 of the West Campus, while Lin Sisi lives in Room 413 of the East Campus.
The room numbers are exactly the same, but in Room 413 of the West Campus, except for Bed 4, all other beds are occupied by students, while in the East Campus, it is the opposite - only Bed 4 is occupied, and the other beds are empty.
"Don't tell anyone the secrets of our club. Let's keep a low profile. There are teachers in this school like me, as well as those who are not so easy to talk to."
Chen Ge remained vigilant at all times. The commotion they caused in the laboratory building was too significant, and it was highly likely that the school authorities had already begun their investigation.
"I don't have much time left. After checking out Room 413, I need to lay low for a while."
There are a total of four buildings in the male dormitory building of the West Campus, with several times more students than the East Campus. The lights are still on, making it the busiest time in the male dormitory building, with sounds of washing up, plastic basin dropping, and conversations, all audible from downstairs.
"This building is similar to the East Campus."
Chen Ge acted very naturally and followed the four students into the first building.
The door of the caretaker's cabin was tightly closed, but the glass window was open, inside which a middle-aged lady in her fifties was humming a song, looking in a good mood.
Next to the small window was a notice stating that students are strictly prohibited from using high-power electrical appliances in the dormitory and from cooking by themselves.
"I remember the notice on the East Campus dormitory building seemed to say - there have been vicious incidents recently, and students are prohibited from going out after lights out."
Separated by one wall, it is almost like two different worlds, just like inside and outside the "door."
Walking through the corridor, Chen Ge and several club members arrived at the entrance of Room 413.
"This dormitory is no different from the other dormitories."
Wang Yicheng opened the door, and after he entered the room, it seemed like everyone in the dormitory was treating him as if he didn't exist, each doing their own thing without speaking to him.
As Wang Yicheng took a few steps inside, the male student sleeping by the door suddenly pushed aside the mosquito net and glared at him, saying, "How many times do I have to tell you?"
"Come in and close the door behind you. Your leg is injured, is your ear not working either?"
The male student spoke in a harsh tone, and he seemed to dislike Wang Yicheng for reasons unknown.
"He didn't close the door because there are still people coming in behind him. If you need an apology, a few of us can apologize on his behalf. Just not sure what kind of apology you need?"
Chen Ge grabbed the door handle and entered the room, casting a glance at the other people in the dormitory.
The male student by the mosquito net became timid when he saw Chen Ge, not saying a word, and pulled the mosquito net back down with a dark expression.
"Teacher Bai, this is Bed 4. Since no one is staying here, we use it to store luggage."
Wang Yicheng pointed at Bed 4, where several suitcases were thrown on top. In this dormitory, only his belongings were stored under his bed, while others threw their miscellaneous items and luggage onto Bed 4.
Chen Ge is very familiar with Bed 4, as he himself has laid on the Bed 4 in the East Campus before.
Walking to the side of Bed 4, although no one is staying on this bed, it is covered with bedding and sheets, but those beddings are now dirty from luggage and miscellaneous items.
