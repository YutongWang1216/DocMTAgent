Fang challenges Juan Mao to read twenty ocean-related e-books and pass tests within fifteen days to play in the sea, despite concerns about potentially eating endangered marine animals. After the painting exhibition, Fang is working on his thesis and is unaware of online discussions about Will's paintings. Will completes his continuing education plan, with his latest painting \"The Neighbor's Dog\" causing controversy online. A mysterious painting by artist Will featuring a dog named Juan Mao captures the attention of buyers, with one collector from Muzhou paying a high price for it. The painting gains widespread attention and becomes a hot topic in Huangzhou, with Juan Mao making headlines in current affairs news. Some speculate on Will's motives for painting Fang's dog in a scary manner, suggesting he may have a psychological issue with dogs.",
