Chapter 70: Donglai Cave Lord (Part VIII)
This is exactly what Song Fu and others wanted to ask. When someone asked ahead of them, they looked at each other, not knowing what was going on, and couldn't answer at all.
Miao Yi immediately flew towards the place where the loud noise occurred, and Yan Xiu and the other three followed closely.
Song Fu and others exchanged glances before following to see what was happening.
As the group arrived at the entrance of the mountain gate, they saw that under the moonlight, the stone archway inscribed with 'Donglai Cave' had been shattered into pieces, causing everyone to be astonished; someone had actually destroyed the mountain gate of Donglai Cave.
Miao Yi suddenly turned his head, his features twisted in a menacing manner as he looked at Song Fu and the others, sneering incessantly, "Excellent!"
"I've just arrived today, it seems someone can't wait to give me a taste of things to come!"
"Very good!"
Song Fu and others were taken aback; they understood the implications of the other party's words, but this was definitely not something they did. They had just been gathered together for a small gathering and were discussing how to give Miao Yi a lesson in the future, all while listening to unusual sounds that prompted them to come out running.
"Several people had initially wondered if it could be Miao Yi and his group who did it, but seeing Miao Yi in this state, they felt there was no need for him to tarnish his own mountain gate by giving himself a lesson. After all, being someone who had just taken office as the cave master of Donglai Grotto, having one's signpost broken down by others was indeed a shameful matter."
"This matter must be clarified, otherwise, we would not be able to bear the responsibility if it were reported. Commander, this is absolutely not something my colleagues and I have done!" Song Fu said with a solemn expression, holding his fist in salute.
The other few people followed suit, bowing their fists to assure, seemingly treating Miao Yi as the cave master for the first time in earnest.
"Ridiculous arguments!"
Miao Yi spoke sternly at Song Fu, "It's only today that I've assigned you to guard the mountain gate. If someone destroys the mountain gate, wouldn't you know about it?"
"Could it be that you're intentionally letting him off easy!"
"This..."
Song Fu was at a loss for words. He didn't actually stay here, so it wouldn't do to say he simply didn't care for the cave lord and hence wasn't present. Instead, he bowed and confessed honestly, "The cave lord might not have been aware of the situation since they just arrived. The laborers from Donglai City haven't been dispatched yet. Our food and drinks are all handled by ourselves. In order to satisfy our hunger, my subordinates temporarily left for a moment. I never expected such an incident to occur."
"Prince Fashi and others also successively bowed and attested, "Cave Lord, we can vouch that Senior Brother Song Fu was dining with us just now."
Miao Yi pointed at the fallen gateway and spoke sternly, "Could this have fallen down on its own? Don't tell me it was blown over by the wind!"
Song Fu felt like a mute swallowing a bitter gourd, and was compelled to raise his hand and say, "Cave Lord, I swear by my Azure Jade Sect's lineage of past masters, this was absolutely not done by us. If even a single word of this is false, may I perish a wretched death, Song Fu!"
Miao Yi scanned everyone with his eyes flickering, speaking in a somber tone, "Could someone be causing trouble at my Donglai Cave?"
The crowd was taken aback, and indeed, this was possible. They all quickly glanced around their surroundings.
"Are you still waiting here? Do you want to be strangled in your sleep?"
"Scatter and search quickly!"
Miao Yi spoke angrily.
"Three of Yan Xiu's followers bowed in response and swiftly dispersed into the surrounding forests."
"What?"
Miao Yi snorted through his nose, glaring at Sòng Fú and the others as if questioning why they weren't searching if it wasn't their doing, implying they knew something.
At this juncture, one must declare their stance to prove their innocence, Song Fu immediately turned around, bellowing, "Still not obeying the cave lord's command to search!?"
The group bowed to Miao Yi and dispersed immediately.
However, Miao Yi called out to Song Fu, "Song Fu, come with me!"
Song Fu hesitated for a moment before bowing and confirming, following behind Miao Yi.
After everyone had left, a ghostly figure resembling a person in water appeared at the spot. It was none other than the elderly White figure, who was undeniably the most exquisite and talented.
As he watched the fallen stone archway, Old White shook his head slightly and chuckled softly, saying, "The world is like a game of chess; how can a热血男儿 [literally 'hot-blooded young man'] only possess the courage of a commoner?"
"Always worried about your inherent kindness, making you prone to being taken advantage of... A true man should know how to navigate the world, something a mere brute cannot do. Now, I feel much more at ease."
Upon the words falling, the entire shadow-like figure swayed like ripples in water, vanishing silently without a trace.
In the grand hall of the East Coming Temple, the candlelight flickered, casting shadows as Song Fu stood in front, following Miao Yi, while the black charcoal outside had already stood up, seemingly sensing something and giving a loud sneeze.
Miao Yi stared at his throne expressionlessly, with his hands behind his back facing away from Song Fu, remaining silent.
The atmosphere between the two was somewhat tense. After waiting for a while, Song Fu couldn't help asking, "What matter has the cave lord summoned me for?"
Miao Yi spoke in a somber tone, "Song Fu, do you know what crime you have committed?"
Senior Brother Song Fu's lips curled in a sneer as he glanced at the wine and food on the low table beside him, saying in a cool manner, "This matter is certainly not our doing, so what crime could I possibly have, Senior Brother Song Fu?"
"I'm not asking that!"
Miao Yi suddenly turned around and stared at him, asking coldly and deliberately, "I tasked you to guard the mountain gate; why did you abandon your post? Could it be that you do not regard my orders as important?"
Inwardly, Song Fu thought, "What do you think?"
They never gave it a second glance.
Of course, he wouldn't say this out loud, "Senior Brother Song Fu has already informed the Cave Lord, it was truly out of necessity. I only left temporarily to find food. I don't want such incidents to happen either."
Miao Yi asked, "Do you think the Lord of the Manor and the Lord of the Mountain will believe your explanation if I report this matter?"
Senior Brother Song Fu chuckled, saying, "Words come out of two mouths. If the Cave Lord insists on falsely accusing me, then please do so. However, do not forget, I also have a mouth to defend myself, I am not a mute."
Miao Yi said with a smirk, "It seems you truly won't repent!"
With these words, Yan Xiu, Duan Biaoyi, and Qiu Shaoqun appeared together outside the door and walked in, bowing to Miao Yi. "Cave Lord, there has been no suspicious person found so far."
Miao Yi said, "Suspect individuals are right before us; where is the matter of not finding them?"
Duan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun seemed to receive a signal, swiftly moving to shut the palace doors.
Upon hearing the sound, Song Fu was startled and quickly turned around, only to see Yan Xiu's pair of battle axes, resembling a god of death, already chopping towards him with fury.
Senior Brother Song Fu swiftly drew his personal sword, a cold gleam emerging from its sheath, swiftly parrying any incoming attacks.
Duan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun almost immediately charged out with their spears, joining forces to attack Song Fu.
Yan Xiu and Senior Brother Song Fu's cultivation levels were roughly equal; the two had already been evenly matched. With Duan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun joining forces, Song Fu's situation suddenly became precarious.
"Baseless criminal!"
"Dare you conspire to harm..."
Under siege, unable to escape, Senior Brother Song Fu, who was desperately clashing swords with Yan Xiu, had not even finished his mournful roar of anger when he was pierced through his magical defenses by two lances charging in, deeply stabbing into his chest.
Senior Brother Song Fu widened his eyes, trying to turn around to look at Miao Yi. His lips trembled, and the fury in his eyes was indescribable.
He finally realized it was a trap. The collapse of the mountain gate pavilion not only aimed to frame him, but also to relocate his fellow disciples, ensuring he couldn't unite with them to resist. The primary objective was to take his life, preventing any potential rebellion against the authority.
