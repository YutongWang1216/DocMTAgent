"Hit a solid board"
"At this moment, when the Azure Gold Light Array was unleashed, the flames dimmed momentarily, being drawn and guided downwards."
"But that fire gourd wasn't something that could be easily dealt with. It suddenly exerted force upwards, actually seizing a portion of the flame. Then, with a 'whoosh', it flew over to one side and shot out of the range of the Azure Gold Light Array."
These changes occurred so rapidly that they left one feeling somewhat dazzled.
"Not easy to deal with, huh! This person."
"Must take care of this quickly, or the enforcers will arrive soon."
The fire gourd spewed downwards, and the woman reappeared, her eyes filled with malice, "What are you doing?"
While she was speaking, a flash of golden light appeared under her feet, and a splendid pattern of light quietly emerged. The woman's body instantly stiffened.
"Tang Wulin's Azure Silver Grass顺势 wound its way upwards, with Ye Xinglan's Star God Sword pointing forward, targeting her opponent's chest. Xie Xie had already silently reached behind her, positioning the light dragon dagger against her neck."
"It's all part of the plan!"
What could be better than Xu Xiaoyan's starlight chain to deal with a single opponent?
The absolute existence of the starlight chain is heaven-defying!
Just as everyone heaved a sigh of relief, thinking they had defeated their opponent, a sudden change occurred! The Star God Sword was already in front of them, and the sharpness of the light dragon dagger behind her had reached her neck. In the face of life-threatening danger, the woman's eyes suddenly lit up.
A loud phoenix cry echoed from her body, followed by an overwhelming surge of spiritual energy bursting forth instantly. As if provoked by something, a series of intense red flames illuminated beneath her clothes, forming a circle of light. These were rings, yet they seemed to be part of her clothing, appearing at various points such as around her neck, shoulders, elbows, waist, and knees. The moment these red flames appeared, the most formidable spiritual energy erupted from the woman's body.
Much stronger than before, the spiritual energy surged and transformed into a massive fiery ring that gushed out. Fine golden patterns appeared on the floating fire gourd in the air, causing the previously one-foot-tall gourd to rise to two feet in height, expanding several times in size.
Intense fluctuations of fire elemental energy burst forth immediately, forcefully propelling Tang Wu Lin and his group away. The flames continued to burn their spiritual energy relentlessly, like parasites clinging to their bones.
The phoenix cry grew more resounding, and an aura of authority emanated from the woman. Following this, pieces of dark-red armor rapidly appeared, covering her entire body.
On top is a definite phoenix helmet that covers the head. The dark-red armor extends outward to both sides, featuring graceful, streamlined contours that continue downward in an arcing motion, outlining the feminine features. Soft lines envelop the shoulders, extending over the entire length of the arms.
The dark-red flame patterns covered the armor. On the breastplate, there was a golden-red phoenix pattern. Though the armor wasn't particularly magnificent, under its coverage, the woman's presence had escalated several levels.
"Tang Wulin blurted out, and a bitter smile already filled his face."
Armored Battle Robe, yes, this is an Armored Battle Robe! Judging by its complexity and the fluctuations, it seems to be a character-level Armored Battle Robe. The series of rings around the woman store the Armored Battle Robe.
A character-level Armored Battle Robe still cannot integrate into the body of an Armored Battle Robe practitioner.
"But even so, this is a complete character-level Armored Battle Robe!"
This means that the woman, originally with a five-ring cultivation, had her strength directly elevated to the seventh environment realm.
Yuanfeng was furious at the moment. She had been in a particularly good mood today, feeling exceptionally happy. Earlier, when she went to the Heavenly Spirit Transmitting Tower, it was to register, officially becoming a character-level Armored Battle Robe practitioner.
Armored Battle Robe practitioners are top-tier beings that any organization would be willing to support. When she signed the contract, the Transmitting Tower promised her a series of benefits. At just twenty-seven years old, she is one of the youngest Armored Battle Robe practitioners in Heavenly Spirit City, with a bright future ahead.
The Transmitting Tower has agreed to assist her in the future by providing substantial resources to help her strive for the level of two-word Armored Battle Robe practitioners. Once she achieves this level, she will truly be considered an Armored Battle Robe practitioner, with a place on the continent as a whole.
Who could have imagined that, after she was so elated leaving the Transmitting Tower, she would be surrounded by this group of young kids?
And their abilities were quite formidable; if they hadn't used their Armored Battle Robes, they really would have been caught off guard just now.
She didn't know that Tang Wu Lin and company had no ill intentions. The Star God Sword and light dragon dagger made her feel the threat of death.
"Right at this moment, Wu Changkong's voice echoed in the ears of Tang Wulin and his six companions, 'Just defeat her, and this city will be considered passed for you.'"
Tang Wu Lin's lip twitched slightly. Teacher Wu, Teacher Wu, you also have a sly side!
This is a full-state one-word Armored Battle Robe practitioner, equivalent to a powerhouse at the Seventh Rank Soul Saint level. Can we possibly win against them?
Before he could ponder further, Yan Feng initiated her move. An immense surge of spiritual energy rose immediately, her right hand pointing at Tang Wulin, and a burst of fireline shot out from the fire gourd above her head, arriving at Tang Wulin's face in an instant.
Given the situation, there's no other choice but to try our luck. Words of explanation would be futile. From the way they're looking at us, it's clear that they've been provoked.
They're not in the right on this matter! Let's address it and see what happens.
Tang Wulin took a deep breath, and the three purple soul rings on his body suddenly vanished. A golden light array appeared, its glow spreading. His right arm swelled, and golden dragon scales spread across it. At the same time, brilliant star lines rapidly gathered in his right hand, forming the Armored Battle Robe gauntlet.
Dealing with a true Armored Battle Robe practitioner, how could he not give his all!
"Armored Battle Robe?"
Yan Feng was startled upon seeing the Armored Battle Robe on Tang Wulin's right hand. The first thing that flashed through her mind was the word "impossible"!
How old is he?
And, she clearly saw that Tang Wulin's Armored Battle Robe emerged directly from within him. Could it be that he possesses a two-word Armored Battle Robe?
While it may just be a single piece of armor, the very idea of having armor at such a young age is simply unimaginable.
When she first obtained her first piece of Armored Battle Robe, she was already twenty-one years old, still considered a prodigy at that.
These years of diligent cultivation have finally allowed her to become a genuine one-word Armored Battle Robe practitioner.
But how old are these little guys right in front of us?
As Tang Wulin initiates his move, everyone else acts swiftly as well.
Xu Lizi had already retreated quite far beforehand. Without needing much explanation, one by one, steamed buns flew out from his hands. Light and agile Xiao Long Bao, bloodthirsty红豆 stuffed buns, each person received one.
Tang Wulin placed his left hand behind his back and had already taken over two steamed buns, stuffing them into his mouth without hesitation.
It must be resolved quickly.
Even a single-word Armored Battle Robe, once complete, can assist Soul Masters in rapidly restoring their soul power.
Engaging in a long-drawn-out battle with them would leave them with no chance at all.
Landing hard on his left foot, producing a loud "thud," Tang Wulin launched himself upwards like a copper arrow, his right arm held in front of him. His blood vessels within his body surged, unleashing a powerful aura reminiscent of the Golden Dragon King. Both of his eyes turned completely golden, and the fluctuating energy in his body exuded a fierce essence.
With his right hand's golden dragon claw in front of him, he forcefully clashed with the opponent's flames, pushing against their forward charge.
As the leader and a strong assault-type battle soul master, he could not afford to retreat even a fraction now. Only by standing in front, shielding the path, would his companions have a chance.
Under the stimulation of the bloodthirsty red bean paste bun, his own soul power and vital energy burst to their peak instantly. His entire body was covered in pale golden scales, and the scales on his right hand, right arm, and right chest were particularly dazzling.
He has twin battle souls?
Yan Feng hesitated momentarily.
"Hmph!"
She didn't evade at all; instead, the fire gourd above her started spinning suddenly. The original fire line transformed into a broad stream of flames that swept over Tang Wulin's head, covering his companions and blocking others.
She aimed to isolate Tang Wulin, dealing with this clear leader of the group first before anything else.
Golden Dragon Claw struck her opponent with lightning speed, and Yan Feng raised her right hand, forming a fist with her palm, clashing head-on.
As they were about to collide, the dragon roar within Tang Wulin's body suddenly intensified. A massive golden dragon head, more than two feet in diameter, appeared out of nowhere, directly engulfing Yan Feng's right arm.
Golden Dragon Shakes the Heavens!
After eating the Red Jade Shrimp that day, Tang Wulin's own气血 did not manage to break through the fourth seal of the Golden Dragon King, but there was a significant improvement, making him more adept at controlling Golden Dragon Shakes the Heavens.
Yan Feng was startled as well. She felt a powerful force coming straight at her, followed by her own punch being devoured by flames. The Golden Dragon Claw, like a giant pair of pincers, grabbed her right hand.
Golden Dragon Claw activates; the 'one-word' Armored Battle Robe on Yan Feng's body shines brightly. All the flame patterns seem to come alive, especially the phoenix on her chest, which actually moves, transforming into a Phoenix Flame Shadow that rushes directly towards Tang Wulin's chest.
