Despite leaving, Puffy maintained high spirits upon returning to the preparatory student dormitory. Upon Fang Zhao's return, Puffy shared that its day had been enjoyable. Post this, Fang Zhao presented Puffy with a challenge; a folder containing twenty ocean-related e-books and accompanying test questions, totaling twenty sets, covering topics like the Ocean Conservation Law, Youth Environmental Protection, Marine Wildlife Conservation, and Management of Marine Environment. The task was to complete all the books and tests with full marks within a maximum of fifteen days before moving in, after which Puffy would be allowed to play in the sea. Puffy showed a mixed response, with drooping ears suggesting a combination of energy and possibly hesitation or reluctance towards the new challenge.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In the \"The Dog Next Door\" chapter, Puffy experienced a delightful day at the beach following a successful house purchase, enjoying swimming and playtime before reluctantly returning home. Puffy expressed eagerness for future visits, aiming to stay longer and participate in more marine activities. Upon returning to the dormitory, Puffy maintained high spirits, sharing that the day had been enjoyable with Fang Zhao. Following this, Fang Zhao challenged Puffy with a folder containing twenty ocean-related e-books and accompanying test questions, totaling twenty sets, covering topics like the Ocean Conservation Law, Youth Environmental Protection, Marine Wildlife Conservation, and Management of Marine Environment. The task was to complete all the books and tests with full marks within a maximum of fifteen days before moving in, after which Puffy would be allowed to play in the sea. Despite the enthusiasm for the beach, Puffy showed a mixed response to the new challenge, with drooping ears suggesting a combination of energy and possibly hesitation or reluctance. Meanwhile, Fang Zhao is cautious about Puffy's potential consumption of endangered marine species, emphasizing the importance of respecting marine life and maintaining discipline and environmental responsibility, especially considering the upcoming move to a location with daily access to the sea. During this period, Fang Zhao focuses on writing a paper while using a do not disturb mode on his phone, and there's mention of an online discussion involving Will's paintings, including a piece titled 'The Dog Next Door' featuring Puffy.",

Puffy expressed excitement for future beach visits, hoping to extend stays and engage in more marine activities. Upon returning, Puffy shared a delightful day with Fang Zhao, who then presented Puffy with a daunting challenge: a folder containing twenty ocean-related e-books and accompanying test questions, each set focused on topics such as the Ocean Conservation Law, Youth Environmental Protection, Marine Wildlife Conservation, and Management of Marine Environment. Puffy was tasked with completing all the materials with full marks within fifteen days before moving in, after which they could play in the sea. Despite the enthusiasm for the beach, Puffy showed signs of mixed feelings, indicating energy alongside possible hesitation or reluctance. Fang Zhao emphasized the importance of respecting marine life and maintaining environmental responsibility, particularly given their impending move to a location with daily access to the sea. During this time, Fang Zhao focused on writing a paper while using a do not disturb mode on his phone. Online, discussions about Will's paintings, including \"My Neighbor\" and \"The Dog Next Door,\" centered around Puffy. \"The Dog Next Door,\" in particular, sparked intense debate due to its complex, vibrant style and unsettling nature, leading to speculations about Will's intentions and mental state regarding dogs.",

Despite the excitement for future beach visits, Puffy faced a daunting challenge upon returning when Fang Zhao presented them with a folder containing twenty ocean-related e-books and accompanying test questions within fifteen days, covering topics like the Ocean Conservation Law, Youth Environmental Protection, Marine Wildlife Conservation, and Management of Marine Environment. Puffy was tasked with completing all the materials with full marks before they could return to the sea. Although enthusiastic about the beach, Puffy showed signs of mixed feelings, indicating both energy and possible hesitation or reluctance. Fang Zhao emphasized the importance of respecting marine life and maintaining environmental responsibility, given their upcoming move to a location with daily access to the sea. As Puffy prepared for the challenge, discussions online about Will's paintings, including \"My Neighbor\" and \"The Dog Next Door,\" centered on their intricate styles and unsettling nature, sparking debates about Will's intentions and mental state regarding dogs. Meanwhile, Will's painting, \"The Dog Next Door,\" became a highly sought-after masterpiece, attracting attention and investment interest, with one collector predicting its future astronomical value. This led to the painting becoming a trending topic, even featuring on the front page of the news. The situation involving the painting also highlighted the unique perspective of the Pasture Islanders towards dogs, which some perceived as odd or obsessive. In the midst of this, Fang Zhao advised his dog Puffy to stay indoors due to the sudden attention the painting had brought.",
