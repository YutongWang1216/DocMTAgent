Chapter 1: A New Journey
The windstorm swept through the canyon, causing waves to ripple across the plains.
The wild ox, with its head down devouring tender grass leaves, raised its head and looked towards the sky.
There, a wooden merchant ship several dozen meters long was suspended in the air, with fully extended sails鼓胀 in the wind, moving forward slowly.
"Regardless of when you look, this wind surge is always so impressive."
The middle-aged man, dressed in leather armor, stood by the deck railings, looking down upon this boundless plain and its breathtaking scenery.
"For us merchants, this is also a rare business opportunity."
Beside the middle-aged man was a slightly plump merchant. He had strange curly hair and wore a merchant's robe. His two small eyes were slightly squinted, as if he was calculating something while staring at the scenery before him. It seemed like even this beautiful view could be sold for money, judging by his appearance.
"If it weren't for it, we probably wouldn't have been able to transport our goods into the central region so quickly."
"Frankly speaking, when I first planned to expand this market, I did face opposition. But now, looking back, my decision was indeed correct."
"But, please allow me to be frank, choosing not to take the major waterway but instead coming through here, although it may save time, the level of danger will also increase."
"I've heard that things haven't been peaceful on the other side recently. Also, I believe you've already been warned by the captain, about the possibility of sea serpents appearing around here. What if..."
The man's expression turned somewhat serious. He turned his head and directed his gaze towards the nearby mountains.
The towering peaks reaching for the clouds blocked his view, preventing him from seeing what was behind.
However, faintly visible in the distance, the sky was not pure azure, but carried a shade of dark depression.
That wasn't a world they should have ventured into.
"Don't worry, there's no such thing as 'what if'. Riches come from taking risks, that's why I paid you such a high price to hire you!"
"Just a few snakes, right?"
The businessman reached out his hand and patted the man's shoulder.
"Right, how is the young man we rescued now?"
"Is he still alive?"
"Licia has already bandaged his wounds. Now he's in a deep sleep, so there shouldn't be any immediate life-threatening risks."
"That's good to hear."
Upon hearing the man's response, the businessman nodded in satisfaction, but soon enough, he furrowed his brow.
"But, what kind of injury did that young man sustain? From the wound, it looks like a large lizard - but are there such peculiar creatures in Paffield's northern region?"
"I'm not sure either, my lord, but I reckon it must be a ferocious beast. Let's hope we don't encounter it."
As he spoke, the man subconsciously glanced at the entrance of the ship cabin, then he turned back and looked ahead again.
Rhode opened his eyes.
"What happened?"
He stared blankly at the ceiling in front of him, his mind hazy.
He recalled that he had once led his team in battling the most powerful boss in the Dragon Soul Continent, the Void Dragon, on a high platform amidst ruins, successfully claiming the first kill. He was sure that he had earned achievements and received system notifications. Following that, the final strike from the Void Dragon took his life.
Originally, according to the plan, Rhode should have revived in the cemetery and then logged out.
But right when he was killed by the Void Dragon, the entire world instantly turned pitch black, as if forcibly isolated. Then, Rhode lost consciousness.
How could that be?
"Could it be that there's an issue with the game?"
Rhode struggled to turn his head, able to catch a glimpse of the blue sky and white clouds outside through the window. Where was he?
Where is this place?
"What exactly happened?"
Was he still dreaming?
Or am I still in the game?
At least, Rhode was certain that this place was definitely not his tiny rented apartment.
Upon considering this, doubt immediately filled Rhode's heart, causing him to furrow his brow. He then tried to sit up.
"Ugh!!!"
And just then, a sudden intense pain surged from Rhode's chest, causing him to grit his teeth and cease his movements.
And at this moment, Rhode realized that both his left shoulder and chest were completely wrapped in bandages. Although he was unsure of what had happened, the steadily seeping blood stains indicated that he had sustained significant injuries.
This absolutely cannot be a game!
Rhode can be sure of this point. After all, although technology has advanced significantly today, and the Dragon Soul Continent, as the world's first full-spectrum virtual reality MMORPG, has utilized many advanced technologies, according to the rules, players should not experience pain. This is done to distinguish between reality and games, and also to consider lowering the entry barrier for players.
And when a player is injured, instead of causing pain, the game utilizes methods such as slowing down the player's movement speed, blocking the player's vision with red representing urgency, and a series of distractions to alert and remind the player of the situation, rather than actually simulating pain.
This kind of behavior sparked considerable controversy in society when holographic simulation technology first emerged, and naturally, the operating company of Dragon Soul Continent would not be unaware of this.
Rhode lowered his head, staring at his right hand. It wasn't the character he had created within the game, not that muscular and wild body.
In contrast, the arm before him was slender and weak, its skin abnormally pale due to常年 not being exposed to sunlight.
This is his actual body in reality, and he is well aware of this fact.
But, how did I get injured?
And, this doesn't seem like a hospital either?
Rhode looked upwards, observing that the entire room seemed to be a cabin; there were no lights, no phone, and no call button.
A wooden table, two chairs, and a cabinet fixed against the wall are all the furnishings here.
For some reason, Rhode felt as though he had seen this scene before somewhere.
And just as Rhode was closely examining the room, the door suddenly opened.
A blonde girl in white robes walked into the room, her eyes widened in surprise as she looked at Rhode, who was half-sitting up.
"You're awake? That's great!!"
The girl was not speaking Chinese nor English, but Rhode could understand her clearly.
This caught Rhode off guard; he knew this language.
This is Nimic, one of the official languages of Dragon Soul Continent!
"How do you feel? Are you alright?"
However, the girl did not pay attention to Rhode's expression. She quickly approached him and carefully examined his left shoulder and chest.
"Your injuries are quite severe, to be honest, I'm a bit worried about whether you can endure..."
"This is..."
Rhode furrowed his brow, unsure of what to say. He turned his head, looking towards the mirror on the wall beside him. The reflection clearly showed his face – there was no doubt that it was indeed his own face. However, it didn't make sense for him to be here.
"You've forgotten?"
The blonde girl blinked her eyes curiously, and her twin tails swayed slightly with her movement. Her piercing blue eyes were clear and transparent, giving off a lively impression.
"Two days ago, you collapsed in the Paffield wilderness and sustained rather severe injuries."
"If it weren't for the 'Silver Balance' merchant ship passing by, things would have been quite dire."
"I truly don't know what you fought against, but the damage to your left body was quite severe. That must have been incredibly dangerous at the time."
Wait, the left shoulder?
Rhode paused for a moment, quickly recalling that during his final battle against the Void Dragon, it was his left side that had been attacked.
However, that was an injury sustained by my character in the game, not by the player themselves, right? But now, it's me who's injured?
Despite the chaos before him, Rhode quickly regained his composure. This was a testament to his psychological resilience as a top-level player and the会长 of the world's strongest MMO guild.
In his conversation with this blonde girl, Rhode also learned about his current situation. He was severely injured and lying on the plains of Paffield, while the Silver Balance trading company's airship happened to pass by, rescuing him in the process.
According to this blonde girl, Rhode's initial condition was rather grim, but his recovery ability was quite impressive.
"I am Licia Noelle, a member of the Star Moon Mercenary Group, a Spirit Master. You can just call me Licia."
The girl introduced herself to Rhode openly and confidently.
"I am Rhode Alent."
Although unable to fully organize the current situation, Rhode hesitated briefly before revealing his identity and in-game ID.
"From the Eastern Plateau Mountains, an adventurer."
"Adventurer, I see, that's why you're alone in such a distant mountain range."
Upon hearing Rhode's response, Licia was not surprised, as on this continent, many adventurers enjoyed exploring alone, so there was nothing particularly problematic about the identity he had declared.
"But, what exactly were you fighting?"
"Why such severe injuries?"
"I remember there shouldn't be any particularly terrifying monsters in this plain area."
Upon hearing the girl's inquiry, Rhode awkwardly smiled.
What could he say, perhaps telling Licia that he was injured during a battle with one of the Five Dragons of Creation, the Void Dragon?
"Because I was attacked at night, I couldn't see clearly what they were. They were numerous and fast, so I think they might have been 'those' things."
"I understand."
Although Rhode didn't provide specifics, Licia nodded as if she understood something. After thoroughly examining Rhode's wounds, she stood up.
"Two days without food, I imagine you must be quite hungry. Please wait, I'll go get you something to eat right away."
"Oh, right, I also need to report this to the captain. I think he will come to see you soon."
After saying this, the girl nodded politely at Rhode and then turned to leave the room.
