Chapter 369: Escaped
The situation was one-sided, with both sides unleashing their full firepower, creating a thick cloud of smoke across the entire ocean.
White Night's high-speed magnetic wave scanner fired again, reducing another aircraft to rubble. This weapon is truly effective, and he's thoroughly enjoying its use. Little Milk Bag commands with ease, as the air force of the First Terror Organization forms an unbreakable offensive and defensive formation, initiating their final round of intense assault.
Nicola, seeing the situation unfavorable, disregarded social hierarchy and raised his voice, "Master, retreat. If we continue like this, we will suffer a complete defeat."
Louis' fists were clenched tightly, his face dark, and his body exuding a strong aura of aggression. He had no trouble seeing the current situation clearly.
Despite his unwillingness, he was defeated so easily. Clearly, victory was within reach, yet he couldn't reclaim them, such a wasted effort; it was truly frustrating.
The man's emerald green eyes swept past the killing intent before disappearing back into those eyes filled with solemn worry. He nodded at Nicola and immediately ordered protection for the withdrawal.
Louis fixed his gaze on the two people floating above the sea surface, snorting coldly. This time, they were lucky, but he wouldn't let this go just like that.
"Darling, they're withdrawing, should we pursue?" White Night chuckled lightly. He had a particular fondness for this magnetic wave scanner, holding it as if it were a child, his lips quirking into a cool and perilous smile.
Baby Cuddle smiled elegantly and ordered to cease the attack. His dark eyes remained calm, as he spoke slowly, "No pursuit, letting him die like this would be too wasteful. The game of cat and mouse is just beginning."
This game has already turned the tide.
Louis, he shouldn't have provoked him no matter what. The death of Nono requires someone to pay the price alongside him, or he won't be able to bear this.
When the game starts, Louis decides, but...
Baby Cuddle's smile was cold and sharp, piercingly intense. When it ends, he decides.
White Night smiled, elegantly waving his sleeve. "Agreed, we won't pursue them. We have plenty of resources to indulge in this game with them. Perhaps it won't even come down to them taking action; Louis might have someone eager to settle things with him."
Baby Cuddle watched their direction of escape, his cold laugh echoing as he remained silent.
"Cy Lee, it's over, no need for backup, we'll head back immediately."
White Night, after making amends with Cy Lee on the phone, ordered his subordinates to turn around and head back to Rome.
The Black Eagle and others had to exert tremendous effort to pull Young Master Ye San and Cheng Anya up, knowing that she was carrying a virus and had already taken preventive measures. They were also aware that Young Master Ye San had a virus himself. The Black Eagle and others were therefore extremely cautious.
Young Master Ye San lay there, breathing heavily like a bull, and couldn't help kicking Miss Cheng, "Little An雅, you really need to lose some weight, you're so heavy."
His whole shoulder was slightly numb because he had been swimming in seawater for a long time, expending a lot of energy, and hanging onto Cheng Anya while she swayed was really taxing on his arm.
Almost lost her to the sea, the memory of that scene still gives him a chill.
The Black Eagle and others rejoiced at their safety, passing towels, pouring hot water, all bustling about busily. Some even made light of how Young Master Ye San had been faring during this period.
The atmosphere on the plane was lively, with men exuding a sense of bravado.
Cheng Anya used the towel handed by the Black Eagle to wipe her hair, wrapping herself in a blanket to soothe her cold body. She automatically tuned out his words, grateful for their safety. She sneezed and couldn't help but wrap herself a bit tighter.
The Black Eagle chuckled and said, "Young Master, if she were even thinner, you'd complain about her having too many bones."
"I'm already嫌弃了."
Young Master Ye San also got up, drying off the seawater on his body, "It's because of all the bones that I weigh so much."
Cheng Anya continued to uphold the virtue of letting actions speak louder than words. The Black Eagle found two sets of clothes for them to change into; since they were men's clothes, they looked rather comical on Miss Cheng. As such, she simply wrapped herself in a blanket.
Just as they finished getting dressed, the Black Eagle informed her that Ningning wanted to speak with her.
Cheng Anya, filled with excitement, seized the microphone, "Sweetheart, it's Mama."
"Hi, Mama, have you been thinking about your baby?"
Baby Cuddle sat on the sofa, chatting with Cheng Anya, full of smiles. It had been a long time since she heard her Mama's voice, and she was quite nostalgic for it.
"I don't want anything."
Cheng Anya snorted coldly, speaking with a fierce tone, "You're too weak, finding your Mama this late, you deserve a beating."
Baby Cuddle, remembering the promise, felt a pang in her heart, then smiled, "Alright, sweetheart, go ahead and hit me. When we return to Rome, you can do whatever you like. I really miss Mama, and you're not showing enough affection towards me. I disapprove of you."
"Reverse the disapproval."
Cheng Anya laughed, worriedly asking, "Did you get hurt?"
"Ningning said with a smile, 'No, I'm fine, nothing happened, don't worry.' 'Mama, the plane is about to land, see you later.' "
"Alright."
Baby Cuddle turned off the communication device. Cheng Anya sipped hot water to warm up, while Young Master Ye San was disappointed; eagerly looking forward to chatting with his son, only to have the call cut off prematurely. He directed accusatory glances at Cheng Anya.
Miss Cheng calmly ignored him, and The Black Eagle chuckled, "Young Master, the plane is about to land, you'll be able to see Little Master soon."
Young Master Ye San felt utterly disregarded and couldn't help pinching Miss Cheng. "The ungrateful little thing."
"Skinflint."
Cheng Anya scolded with a smile, handing him the hot water. Young Master Ye San finished the remaining hot water from Miss Cheng's cup, and it would have been even better if there was some wine to warm his body.
The plane landed quickly, touching down entirely within the castle. Cy Lee, Ye Wei, and others were all present. Upon seeing Young Master Ye San and Cheng Anya safe, everyone heaved a sigh of relief.
"Brother Three, Mrs. Three, you've really made a mess of it..."
"Ye Wei laughed, her face contorted with mirth, 'Brother Three, I should have taken a picture to keep as a souvenir.'"
"Stinky brat."
Young Master Ye San chuckled and cursed, relieved that Vivi Eleven and Baby Cuddle were all right, finally putting his mind at ease.
"How can anything go wrong after all this effort?"
Baby Cuddle tried to embrace Cheng Anya with joy, but she was sternly stopped, reminding Baby Cuddle of the virus on his Mama. The Black Eagle had mentioned it earlier. He then observed the joined hands of Papa and Mama, feeling a slight heaviness in his heart.
"Daddy, Mama, you both... White Night, please help them check."
Baby Cuddle's first instinct would be to seek out White Night, a genius doctor capable of treating any illness.
"Understood, understood, don't worry."
White Night smiled.
"Virus?"
A good-looking golden-haired man with blue eyes winks, "Little White, isn't this not your forte?"
"Little White?"
White Night twisted his wrist, smiling elegantly and gently, "Jason, try calling me 'Little White' one more time?"
"..." Damn, what's wrong with me calling you Little White? You're already Little White, yet you guys still call me Blackjack Jr."
Jason, known as the Fire Dragon, burst into flames on the spot, resembling a golden lion king, yet still handsome enough to incite admiration from gods and mortals alike.
Especially those celestial azure eyes, shining like sapphires.
"When provoked, there's a terrifying aura that sends chills down one's spine, akin to a volcanic eruption, exuding a rather overt domineering presence."
Beside him stood Blackjack, a young man in his twenties, strikingly handsome. He was of mixed British-Chinese heritage, his features blending the mystery of Eastern aesthetics with the depth of Western allure. He had a pair of gray-blue eyes that were often shrouded in a misty veil, giving the impression of profound emotion. Upon closer inspection, however, one would discover his exceptional acumen, his inner reserve cleverly concealed.
The two leaders of the First Terror Organization were relatively young, their personalities vastly different, yet each exuded a formidable presence, embodying a sense of supreme authority. One could only imagine how much more dominant they would appear alongside the three other grand leaders present.
This row, when viewed, has a strong visual impact.
"Jason, you really deserve a good fixing."
"Eleven snorted, 'What a name, calling him Little White, Little White, beat him.'"
Cheng Anya glanced at them, shook her head, and said, "Brother Three, Sister Three, don't bother with them. You guys should take a hot bath first, and then we can check later to avoid getting sick."
She summoned the maid to bring Ye Chen and Cheng Anya downstairs to freshen up. Although Baby Cuddle wanted to join them, he stayed here instead. White Night was about to strike someone, so Baby Cuddle quickly grabbed his sleeve.
"White Night, can you find a way to save my Papa and Mama?"
The child's eyes were bright, like two black grapes set against their pale, smooth faces, filled with anticipation. It seemed that the glow in his eyes would dim if White Night were to shake his head.
Jason grasped Baby Cuddle by the arms and hugged him, exuding an aura of grandeur, "My dear, don't worry, Little White can even save the dead, let alone living people. You have no reason to be concerned. Whenever you have time, come over and let me take care of the Mafia's defenses."
"Who just questioned White Night's medical skills?"
Blackjack expressed doubt about this, but Jason swiftly dodged his palm strike.
Baby Cuddle, held by the tall man, was in a state of great discomfort, kicking Jason, "Put me down."
"Father wants a son like that too, Ningning. You could be my son? I've been eyeing you for a long time." Jason's azure eyes gleamed with intense desire, as if little Ningning was a juicy piece of meat.
The crowd, "..."
White Night smiled and said, "Jason, let your mom teach you some more Chinese. Don't always say that the officer can't use words properly; you won't fare much better yourself."
"I'm not at the same level as the officer, right?"
Jason was very unhappy that he was being linked to the officer, saying that there was no business relationship between officials and criminals, and this was a principle issue.
Baby Cuddle struggled slightly, and Jason put him down. Then, Baby Cuddle asked, "White Night..."
"Ningning, I can only confirm their condition after examining them, so please don't rush," White Night said, rubbing Baby Cuddle's head. "I assure you, I'll do everything I can."
Given the recent loss of hope for his parents' survival and their uncertain fate, no matter how composed he tried to be, Baby Cuddle was uneasy. He couldn't afford to lose them again, and White Night understood his current state of mind very well.
"Don't worry too much," White Night said.
Ye Wei said, "Alright, hand it over to White Night. There's no problem in this world that can't be solved. Since Louis could create the virus, there must be a cure. It's impossible that there's no solution. If White Night can't solve it, let's remove his trademark."
Cy Lee smiled and said, "Agreed."
"Little White, do you have a trademark?"
Jason was deeply perplexed, as he had never known what his trademark was.
Eleven really wanted to punch him in one blow.
"When it comes to this, why haven't you two brought Louis back?"
Blackjack asked, "If this guy had died early, we would have been at peace."
"Old man, I've been wanting to wipe him out for a long time. The Mafia has been provocating everywhere these days, and this guy has the nerve to still indulge in romantic relationships despite his headquarters being destroyed. He's truly incompetent."
"Louis isn't in a hurry," Baby Cuddle said slowly, a dangerous curve appearing on his face. The gleam in his pitch-black eyes was filled with schemes. "Victory without battle is the highest level of winning. It's one thing that he has a personal grudge against us, but the struggle between the Mafia and terrorist organizations is another matter altogether."
"We would definitely need substantial financial and material resources to eliminate the Mafia."
After this incident, his position within the Mafia is shaky. I've always suspected that there's a hidden strength within the Mafia that we can't see. Otherwise, they wouldn't allow Louis's self-destructive actions, so let's use Louis to guide us and uncover this force. Once we find it, we'll eliminate it all at once.
Cunning...
This is what everyone thinks.
Although everyone knew he was usually cunning and devious, because of his young age, they couldn't help spoiling him. Furthermore, with his baby-pink appearance, people often overlooked his true nature.
"Cunning!"
Jason raised his thumb. He was always an action-oriented person, not one to spend much time second-guessing or overthinking things. However, most of the time, he would listen to the plans proposed by Black Jack and Cy Lee.
Baby Cuddle's plans, he has always followed without question.
A full-blown action-oriented group follows a powerful think tank, making this force quite terrifying.
"Cy Lee said, 'I agree with Ningning's method.' He and White Night have always supported his ideas, 'A solution for once and for all, to avoid anyone thinking they're invincible and constantly challenging us.'"
"When have you ever contradicted Ningning? Working together in shamelessness."
Black Jack smiled, "However, this time, it's indeed necessary to give the Mafia a lesson, ensuring they take a detour whenever they see us for the next fifty years."
White Night nodded, and he had no objections. His primary concern was to find a cure for the virus affecting Young Master Ye San and Cheng Anya. This was the most critical issue, and the rest could be handled by Cy Lee.
Ye Wei and Eleven exchanged glances, wondering about another faction.
Their minds both conjured up the same face, that of Mo Yue and Mo Jue?
In the underworld, only they possess enough influence and mystery. Apart from them, the girls couldn't think of anyone else who could display such resolve. The men who were supposed to be above Louis didn't have any reason to obey him.
The group moved to the living room, where Baby Cuddle went to find Cheng Anya. She had just finished her bath and had a cup of hot tea, warming her body and cheeks, which turned slightly pink. She was lying in bed, thoughtfully staring at her own fingers.
"Mama..."
Baby Cuddle walked in through the door, smiling as he approached.
Cheng Anya regained her composure, squinted her eyes, and praised, "My dear, you really have a sense of style."
This outfit truly exudes presence; there's not a hint of a childlike quality anywhere. It makes the person seem like a complete danger.
"Thank you, Mama, for the compliment."
"Don't come too close, sit further away, I'm afraid I might lose control and hit you."
Cheng Anya pointed to the sofa across from her and said, "Sit there."
Baby Cuddle glared at Cheng Anya with a sullen look, "Mama, you're rejecting me now."
"Correct answer."
Cheng Anya chuckled, casting a glance at Baby Cuddle. She always felt that there was something different about this child, despite appearances remaining largely unchanged. As a mother, she knew her child best, and she could sense any subtle changes, no matter how well hidden they might be.
"Mama, why are you looking at me like this? Do you think I'm looking good?"
Baby Cuddle winks mischievously, looking adorable.
Cheng Anya gave him a half-smile, half-stern look, "You've picked up quite a bit of your father's narcissism. Now, tell your Mama honestly, have you been没事 lately? Were you bullied?"
Baby Cuddle shook his head, "No."
"Ridiculous, Louis showed me the pictures, clearly he was beaten to a pulp."
Cheng Anya clearly didn't believe it, gritting her teeth, "Even if he were to be tortured to death, I wouldn't find it satisfying enough."
Thinking back to everything she had endured, Cheng Anya was filled with hatred towards Louis.
The bright face was shrouded in a layer of coldness. Just thinking about what Baby Cuddle had endured, she had a bad预感.
"Mama, I'm really fine, it was probably just something he synthesized."
Baby Cuddle smiled elegantly, rolled up his sleeves, revealing a slender, pale arm, "Look, not a single scar."
The wounds on his arm were healing mostly, and soon, he wouldn't be afraid at all if Cheng Anya discovered them.
And those whip marks he had endured before were left by Xu Nuo. Since they were marks from Xu Nuo, he didn't feel like he was being bullied. Instead, he somewhat missed the pain of being beaten by her in the past.
"If Ningning could survive, he'd rather endure her beatings for the rest of his life."
"Ningning, you're really okay?"
Cheng Anya's brow furrowed, not missing the fleeting hint of pain in her son's eyes.
Baby Cuddle nodded, "I'm really fine, Mama. It's you and Daddy who have issues. Uncle Black Eagle said you have a virus, and even Daddy got infected?"
Cheng Anya recalled the insatiable desires of Young Master Ye San, her cheeks turning red once again. She no longer felt any desire or longing, "Don't mention it. I've jumped out of a plane once in the desert and again at sea. How could I possibly avoid contact?"
Miss Cheng spoke calmly, and Baby Cuddle did not doubt her.
"Mama, there won't be any problems. Doctor White Night is so skilled, he must have a way to save you."
