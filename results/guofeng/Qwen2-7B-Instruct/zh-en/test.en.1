"Chapter 1064: The End of Arrow Corporation"
Under the suppression of the mortars, chaos reigned within the base, and no one noticed the presence of this special forces unit within the camp.
With minimal effort, Koutepov placed a beacon on the predetermined target, then led his squad out of the base. After safely arriving at the evacuation point, he called for the airstrike.
Soon, Russian stealth bombers roared over the clouds, dropping four bombs that precisely hit two ammunition depots and two fuel tanks within the base.
The shockwave from the explosion swept across the entire camp, directly demolishing the surrounding concrete structures.
The explosive ammunition and burning fireballs flew around the camp, triggering a chain reaction, leaving flames everywhere, blood, and corpses scattered about.
The elite guard regiment stationed within the camp suffered a significant loss, with nearly half of its members sustaining injuries. Most of the remaining soldiers were also wounded, making it difficult to find anyone uninjured.
Medics carrying stretchers moved through the base, searching for injured personnel who had lost the ability to move.
Demolition engineers, clad in heavy blast-resistant suits, bravely rushed into the inferno, dragging out unexploded ammunition from the rubble.
All the mobile soldiers moved, looking for their squad to regroup.
Saldes looked out the window at the flames, despair slowly etching onto his lifeless eyes.
Thick smoke obscured the entire base, with the flames coloring the entire night sky red, making it seem like the end of the world.
"Shit..."
Muttering to himself, he moved his leaden legs and slowly left the window.
Turning around, he met the eyes of the staff officer at the command center.
"Sir, what should we do?"
The aftermath of the explosion finally subsided, and there were no more sounds of ammunition殉blowing up within the base. However, everyone's emotions could not settle down. The mercenaries who had narrowly escaped the blast knew that this was just the beginning of their nightmares.
The previous explosion seemed to have ignited a signal, sounding the attack horn for the Sami military.
Under Jiang Chen's instruction, Sami seized this fleeting opportunity, standing before everyone and raising his arms in a rally call, leading the remaining rioters to charge onto the front lines.
Six thousand-plus individuals ran across the tundra, rushing towards the forest with flickering flames.
In the distance, the scene was quite spectacular.
As a result, all the mercenaries fighting on the front lines, gazing at the thick smoke rising from the base behind them, fell into panic. Their previously high morale plummeted to an abyss in an instant.
Facing the tide of rioters charging at them, even if they had the capability to hold the line, they lost their will to fight.
Without any doubt, the Arrow Corporation's defenses were breached, and the stubborn mercenaries were overwhelmed by the Sami military's sea of troops, unable to hold their ground.
A portion of them fled back into the burning base, but the majority deserted, escaping deep into the forest.
No need for Jiang Chen to remind, even a pig should know what to do at this moment.
Watching as Sami led the rioters attacking the military base, Jiang Chen put away the telescope in his hand and summoned the off-road motorcycle he had prepared beforehand from his storage space, gently patting Ayisha's back.
"Almost there, let's head out."
"Uh-huh!"
Ayisha nodded in response, and once Jiang Chen was seated on the motorcycle, she skillfully straddled him from behind.
The engine roared, and the tires kicked up a layer of fragmented snow.
Jiang Chen rode the off-road motorcycle down the slope, guiding Ayisha around to the side of the base. He parked the motorcycle by the roadside, then pulled out the laser sword from his storage space, casually waving it around in his hand. With little effort, he sliced through the steel-wire mesh protective barrier.
The entire base was engulfed in flames and chaos, with the occasional sound of mortar explosions. All mercenaries capable of wielding firearms had advanced to the frontlines, battling the rioters for control of the base's main entrance.
Only a guard squad remained stationed at the entrance of the command center, as the entire rear area was devoid of any other personnel.
For Jiang Chen and Ayisha, this was no different from being completely unprepared.
A total of ten guards were present, with two stationed on the watchtower and the remaining eight at the entrances on the first and second floors.
Ayisha drew out her ghost sniper rifle and silently took down the two guards on the watchtower. Then, using the blind spots in the line of sight, she methodically eliminated the eight people upstairs and downstairs one by one.
Once Ayisha had dealt with the guard detachment outside the command center, Jiang Chen took out his rifle and started walking towards the main entrance. It was precisely as he passed by the Humvee by the door that he bumped into Saldes, who was frantically escaping from inside the command center, along with the command center's staff officer.
Meeting each other's gaze, both parties were visibly taken aback.
The staff officer was the first to react, immediately reaching into his chest to draw his gun. However, before his hand could even touch his heart, Ayisha, reacting even faster, blew his head off.
Saldes was about to resist, but he was easily controlled by Jiang Chen, who handcuffed him behind his back and pressed him against the nearby Humvee.
"Saldes, male, 43 years old."
"Acting as the CEO of Arrow Corporation and also the highest commander, is that correct?"
Although it was their first encounter, Jiang Chen's holographic helmet, which was connected to the ghost agent database and worn on his head, contained his photos and personal information.
A single glance was all it took for his intelligence to be projected onto the holographic screen.
With his face pressed against the hood of the car, Saldes proved to be rather stubborn, refusing to surrender. He gritted his teeth and said.
"I won't say anything, just kill me..."
"Kill you?"
"I haven't asked you anything yet."
Jiang Chen grinned, completely disregarding his non-cooperative demeanor. He extended his right hand, pulling out a syringe and毫不客气地扎进了他的后肩 without any hesitation.
"Ahh!"
"Agh!" Saldes let out a defiant growl, his bloodshot eyes bulging in defiance, but soon the spark in his eyes dimmed.
Jiang Chen simply released the hand holding him, assuming that a regular person resisting after being given a truth serum was unprecedented.
Turning Saldes over, Jiang Chen asked question word by word.
"Where is Carmen?"
"The underground bunker... within the research facility."
"Where is the underground bunker?"
"The entrance is at the center of the base, accessible only via elevators."
"Adjacent to the entrance are two helipads, you'll see them when you walk over."
Through a series of questions and answers, Jiang Chen quickly obtained the information he desired.
"Very well, now you can have your wish."
Jiang Chen drew his pistol and fired a shot into his head, then discarded his corpse to one side.
This was a rather satisfying way to go, but for Mr. Koutepov, the renowned General Manager of Arrow Corporation, to die in obscurity, perhaps it would be even more painful than death itself... if dead people could feel pain.
"The underground bunker, indeed."
Looking towards the center of the base, a cold smirk appeared on Jiang Chen's lips.
"No matter what Carmen has planned, his luck is about to run out."
"The fate of the Rothschild family will mirror their beginning - rising to prominence through war, and fading into obscurity after it..."
However, just then, a piercing scream echoed from the distance.
