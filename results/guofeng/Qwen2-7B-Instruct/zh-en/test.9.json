The incident raises suspicions, but when Miao Yi confronts them, they deny involvement, explaining that they were unaware of the situation due to recent arrival and handling of tasks themselves. They claim that their subordinate momentarily left for food, which led to the damage. Prince Fashi and others also attest to Song Fu's presence during the meeting.

Three followers of Yan Xiu responded and scattered into the surrounding forests. Miao Yi called Song Fu to accompany him, suggesting he might know something about the incident. An elderly White figure, an expert, observed the situation from afar, lamenting the lack of world navigation skills among the '热血男儿', implying their kindness often led them to be exploited. He believed a true man should know how to navigate the world, unlike a mere brute. After his comment, the figure disappeared silently.

Miao Yi suspected foul play, ordering everyone to disperse and search, while three followers of Yan Xiu scattered into the forests. Miao Yi called Song Fu to accompany him, suspecting he might know about the incident. An elderly White figure, an expert, observed the scene, criticizing the '热血男儿' for their lack of world navigation skills, suggesting they are often exploited due to their kindness. He believed a true man should know how to navigate the world, unlike a mere brute. The figure then disappeared silently. In the East Coming Temple, the black charcoal gave a loud sneeze, indicating it sensed something. Miao Yi, standing on his throne with his back turned, acknowledged the tension with Song Fu. Song Fu was summoned by Miao Yi and accused of failing to guard the mountain gate. Despite denying responsibility, Miao Yi pressed on, accusing Song Fu of neglecting his duties. Song Fu privately thought the accusations were unwarranted but did not voice his thoughts. When asked if the Lord of the Manor and the Lord of the Mountain would believe his defense, Song Fu confidently asserted his ability to defend himself. Miao Yi revealed the arrival of Yan Xiu, Duan Biaoyi, and Qiu Shaoqun, who supported Miao Yi. The trio closed the palace doors, trapping Song Fu inside. As Song Fu was attacked by Yan Xiu and the others, he was overwhelmed and ultimately defeated, his magical defenses pierced by spears, causing deep wounds to his chest.",
