Chapter 449: "The Dog Next Door"
After carefully examining the house and confirming there were no major issues, they essentially settled on it. The remaining事宜 would be handled by Nanfeng in discussions with the real estate agent and the original homeowner.
Today, Puffy had an exceptionally good mood, going out to play and have fun to the fullest.
After swimming around in the sea and being called back to shore by Fang Zhao, the dog dug for quite some time in the sand, playing. When it was time to leave, the dog's eyes remained fixed on the car window, filled with reluctance.
Nanfeng, noticing this, chuckled and said, "Don't worry, Puffy. You'll be able to move in right away next time you come. Then, you can play as long as you want, swimming in the sea every day, and even playing with little fish and shrimp!"
Puffy felt elated, lying inside the car and starting to envision his blissful future life.
What impression does Puffy have of the ocean?
The impression of having seafood buffet meals for free.
Its joyful mood lasted until returning to the preparatory student dormitory.
After Nanfeng and the others left, Fang Zhao closed the dormitory door and called out, "Puffy, come over."
Puffy wagged its tail vigorously and hurriedly凑过去.
"Did you have fun today?"
Fang Zhao asked.
"Wo!"
"Was it fun over there?"
"Fang Zhao asked again."
"Puffy jumped up and let out another 'Wo!', wagging its tail particularly vigorously."
"Speak."
"Fun!"
"Puffy said."
"Puffy is now proficient at switching languages fluently, pronouncing clearly."
"Yeah."
"Fang Zhao nodded, then turned on the study machine."
"Puffy: ‘...’"
Ears twitched, she recoiled her dog paws, seemingly trying to retreat inconspicuously.
"Fang Zhao ignored its retreat, turned on the study machine, and showed it a new folder containing the recently purchased e-books."
"The Ocean Conservation Law"
"The Youth Environmental Protection Knowledge Series"
"The List of Marine Wildlife Conservation"
"The Management of Marine Environment"
"The One Hundred Ocean Knowledge Points Everyone Needs to Know in the New Era"
"The Sea, My Home"
All of them are ocean-related books, totaling twenty volumes.
Not only are there e-books, but also accompanying test questions, making up twenty sets.
"Puffy: ‘...’"
Energized ears drooped.
"You know you read quickly, so you should be even faster now?"
"When you finish the twenty books in the folder, complete all twenty corresponding practice tests with full marks, then you can go play in the sea."
"Fang Zhao said, 'We're looking at a maximum of fifteen days until we move in.'"
These are facts to be memorized, and given Puffy's current memory and learning capabilities, getting full marks isn't particularly challenging.
"Fang Zhao is not concerned about Puffy's safety in the sea, rather, he worries that Puffy might consume endangered marine animals to the point of extinction."
"How large Puffy's stomach is, Fang Zhao still doesn't know."
During the broadcast on the planet Burestar, Puffy has snuck into eating in the desert and at sea, but due to Fang Zhao's warnings, Puffy hasn't truly let loose its appetite.
"After all, the time spent on Burestar was limited, with Fang Zhao overseeing things, and also considering the needs of others on the planet, Puffy couldn't indulge in too much偷吃."
"But in the future, with the opportunity to go to the sea every day in their new home, allowing Puffy unrestricted access would be akin to an invasive species, potentially disrupting the ecological balance of the sea with just one dog's influence."
"Fang Zhao needed to prepare Puffy for certain matters, as the fragile marine life had好不容易recovered to its current state, and he couldn't afford for Puffy to disrupt it."
"If you don't aim for full marks, don't think about entering the sea. Keep company with the study machine!"
This day, Nanfeng came to visit Fang Zhao regarding the new residence renovation事宜.
Upon entering the dormitory, Nanfeng noticed Puffy leaning against the wall, hanging its head down dejectedly, with tear stains beneath its eyes.
Pausing for a moment, Nanfeng shifted his gaze, then went to find Fang Zhao to address the matters at hand.
As for Puffy, this is the norm, and Nanfeng has grown quite composed in dealing with it.
After discussing the renovation, Nanfeng remembered something from today and asked, "Right, boss, did you know about what happened online today?"
"What's the matter?"
"Fang Zhao is writing a paper today, and I set up notifications, so he won't be disturbed for unimportant matters."
During this period, there were many discussions about him online, and many people were looking for him. Fang Zhao could only set his phone to do not disturb mode.
"Do you know Will's paintings?"
"Nanfeng asked."
"Yes, it's about Will's graduation work?"
"Fang Zhao had visited Will's graduation art exhibition, where he also received an A+ score. Among the artworks, one depicted Puffy, titled 'The Dog Next Door'."
"Two days have passed since the exhibition, and since Fang Zhao started writing his paper in the dorm from morning onwards, he really doesn't know what happened online."
"Nanfeng shared the information he had learned with Fang Zhao."
Originally, after Will's graduation art exhibition, the academy showcased his paintings on the school website, sparking much discussion.
Will successfully completed the进修 plan he set last year, with a short-term goal of drawing Fang Zhao and a long-term goal of drawing Fang Zhao's dog.
"The short-term goal was already accomplished; Will's painting of 'My Neighbor', which initially sparked controversy online, even had netizens jokingly saying that Fang Zhao was depicted as an alien."
This time, following "My Neighbor," "The Dog Next Door" once again topped the hot search list for the day.
"The Dog Next Door" was the piece that took the most time, required the deepest focus, and the greatest effort for Will during his进修, and it was also the most satisfactory work for him.
This painting shares a similar style with "My Neighbor," yet it appears more challenging to decipher. While "My Neighbor" at least hints at human characteristics, "The Dog Next Door" fails to convey the canine form clearly. One wouldn't recognize it as a dog, let alone a small pet dog, without seeing the title of the artwork.
The vibrant color palette is rich with life, mysterious yet grandiose, almost too transcendent to comprehend, yet one cannot pinpoint what is amiss. The more one delves into it, the deeper a sense of awe and unease arises within.
"Wonderful, the dog Fang Zhao has, isn't it terrifying?"
After seeing this painting, a student from the Royal College of Art recalled the little poodle they had encountered on campus, then searched online for Fang Zhao's dog to ensure they hadn't misremembered.
Here at the Royal College of Art, those who have heard Fang Zhao's graduation concert and closely analyzed Will's painting will have a different perspective.
"If I were to put it simply, this painting evokes feelings similar to Fang Zhao's song 'η'."
"It's a bit beyond the realm of normal understanding."
Even amateur observers standing in front of this painting, taking a few seconds to quietly admire it, might feel uneasy deep down, even if they don't understand it, causing their bodies to involuntarily shiver.
Online, the discussions were intense.
"I've noticed that after his further studies, Will has completely let go, his thoughts freely roaming. It's beyond our comprehension."
"What grudge! To draw Fang Zhao's dog like this!"
"The friend up front must not have seen Will's previous work, 'My Neighbor'. Take a look and see how Will portrays Fang Zhao."
"Perhaps Will has been bitten by a dog, suffering from a psychological trauma towards dogs, otherwise it's impossible for him to draw them so terrifying!"
"A sweet little thing turned into a monster!"
"This is called art!"
"The world of artists truly isn't something that ordinary people like us can comprehend."
"No exaggeration, I stared at the painting for a full five minutes, still unable to grasp what he was trying to convey. But there was an inexplicable sense of awe, and a strange feeling lingering in my mind."
"This type of artwork delves deeper, requiring careful examination."
"Would this painting sell well?"
"You can also use it to ward off evil spirits when you bring it back."
"It's still worth investing in, I have high hopes for this painter, Will, he's still young."
After Will's paintings were showcased on the school network, people began to approach him to buy them.
The final collector from Pasture Island purchased the painting "The Dog Next Door" at a high price, far exceeding the Royal Academy's estimated value.
Some believed that the collector from Pasture Island was overly obsessed with Puffy, and when faced with Puffy, the Pasture Islanders seemed perpetually unsteady.
There were also those who saw it as pure exploitation, whether for Will himself or for Fang Zhao's dog. The Pasture Islanders' approach to matters concerning dogs indeed defied understanding, as if they had lost their minds.
In response to this, the Fine Arts Channel of the Royal Island Television Station dispatched someone to interview the person who bought the painting at a high price.
During the interview, the collector from Pasture Island stated, "Many people buy Will's paintings, investing in Will himself rather than the artwork."
"I am different; I see the painting, of course, and the dog within it."
"I have a feeling that this painting will be炒到 astronomical prices in the future."
Upon seeing the live interview, Little Bear observed: "Pasture Islanders really have a terrifying intuition when it comes to dogs."
"Indeed, humans are peculiar creatures."
As a result, Puffy, thanks to Will's painting "The Dog Next Door," also became a trending topic and appeared on the front page of the royal island's news.
After Nanfeng left, Fang Zhao browsed through online news and instructed Puffy, "Stay indoors for these few days. Just come back in five minutes to continue reading."
"The morning test only scored 62, so let's review the part about protecting animals two more times!"
"Can whales be eaten!"
"Coral cannot be eaten either!"
