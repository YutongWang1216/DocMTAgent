Chapter 1898: Unforgettable Even Without Thinking (IV)
"Words Like Life gave her a dirty look, "Wen Xuxu, you're being self-centered."
"Could it be that I don't look good?"
"Wen Xuxu frowned, pouted, and pretended to be angry."
"Words Like Life was taken aback for a moment, then chuckled. The hand that was supporting Xuxu's upper body squeezed her chest firmly."
Lowering her head, she glared at her, gritting her teeth, "...Cunning, foolish woman."
He quickened his pace, walked to the bedside, showing no mercy or admiration for women, and directly threw Xuxu onto the bed. Then, he undid the buttons of his shirt one by one without waiting for them to line up.
Unbuckling his belt, stripping off all the restraints on his body, then diving under the covers and pressing down on Xuxu.
Straightforward and brutal, not at all elegant.
Deeper black eyes met hers, causing Xuxu's heart rate to uncontrollably accelerate.
Yes, after all these years together, whenever she locked eyes with him like this, her heart still fluttered like a young doe, feeling shy and embarrassed.
Perhaps it's because they're too familiar, always feeling a bit awkward.
So when people say that it's hard to target someone you're familiar with, that even rabbits don't eat the grass near their burrow, it really is true.
As Xuxu blushed and appeared shy, Yan Rusheng felt a mix of excitement and regret. The excitement was his body's natural hormonal response, while the regret stemmed from within him.
While he enjoyed seeing her shy, he didn't like her being awkward due to shyness, always so reserved and not initiating things.
"What else do you want to hear? I'll tell you everything, you watch me."
Yan Rusheng held Xuxu's face with both hands, forcing her to meet his gaze.
Xuxu's face turned even redder, her lips pursed, and her gaze flickered uncertainly. "So, just spit it out - did you also steal someone else's love letters for me?"
"Well..."
Yan Rusheng appeared to be deep in thought, speaking as he pondered, "Aside from Zhao Zheng's love letters, Jiang Zhuo-heng's chocolates and movie tickets, there was also He Bang, the son of the Public Security Bureau Director from our senior year, who performed with the Seven Color Tang."
Upon hearing this, Xuxu was quite surprised, "What? He Bang?"
That boastful fellow, the top-ranking science student who's praised by thousands?
That boastful fellow, the top-ranking science student who's praised by thousands, is so because of his name, not actually being praised by thousands. People are justå¤¸ him when they call out his name, implying he's good and impressive.
Upon hearing that name, she realized there was someone at school with the same name and found it rather negative.
But isn't that guy not a bookworm? How does he also give her things?
"Yes, the name is truly degrading, and the person who named it is even more so."
Yan Rusheng spoke with disdain, "Thank goodness I ate that lollipop for you. The seven colors were all dyed with artificial colors. At the time, my tongue and lips were dyed every color of the rainbow. Junk food, cheap stuff."
Xuxu: "..."
Given what he's saying, she would have to thank him for eating something someone else gave her?
Xuxu felt a mix of anger and amusement, unable to hold back as she reached out and jabbed Yan Rusheng on the forehead forcefully, "Yan Rusheng, why don't you just go to heaven?"
He truly relishes getting the best of situations and rubbing it in, a tactic he loves to employ.
After saying that, she looked at him again, asking with a smile, "So, you didn't like Director Hao because of He Bang?"
Although it was a question, the tone was firm.
"..." Yan Rusheng pursed his lips in silence, effectively acknowledging the statement.
Xuxu couldn't help it, diving back into his deep, dark eyes. She pouted, making an 'eh' sound, and her gaze awkwardly shifted elsewhere.
Then she asked, "How did you manage these? I had no idea."
She pouted, seemingly trying to start a conversation without anything specific to say.
