Chapter 210: Matters between the Overseer and Empress Dowager 64
For a moment, Xiao Mo felt her spirit stir, filled with sorrow.
This is... something he dares not do, right?
Once his body starts moving, his mind will also begin to function. How could someone so smart not know that Bai Weiwei is already dead?
He didn't want to admit it, nor was he willing to delve deeper into the truth. He could only force himself to remain seated, convincing himself that Bai Weiwei had merely fallen asleep and would soon wake up.
Xiaomo felt that only when Bai Weiwei's corpse began to decompose would the Overseer truly regain his sanity, realizing that the person he was holding hands with had been dead for quite some time.
However, strangely, Bai Weiwei's corpse showed no change at all.
Even her pale complexion improved significantly; although her body remained cold, it was undeniably as if she were sleeping.
Not a single feature of the corpse appeared.
Muyanjun stayed by her side, his eyes growing brighter and brighter.
The old, godly physician was finally brought here. He was chewing on a heart-protecting pill, saying, "My old life probably won't last much longer."
Muyanjun hadn't slept for five days, and anyone could see how exhausted he was.
However, he was abnormally alert, to the point of being terrifyingly abnormal.
"After I gave her the medicine, she fell asleep like this. I think it's time for you to come over and check if she'll wake up anytime soon?"
The old man sighed before walking to the bedside to take Bai Weiwei's pulse.
"The phenomenon is actually extremely rare, so there's no need for treatment. However, there is one particularly important matter that needs to be done..."
Muyanjun listened intently, his gaze intense and focused, like a good student, as if a flame were burning in his eyes.
The old man's voice dropped, "It means I should treat another person again..."
Muyanjun leaned forward, unwilling to miss his words.
The old man's technique was swift like lightning, puncturing his neck with a needle in an instant.
Muyanjun's eyes suddenly widened, and his hand reached out to strike the old man's forehead.
Xiao Mo extended her hand horizontally, seizing Muyanjun's attack.
Back and forth, Muyanjun couldn't hold on and fell into a faint.
The old man rubbed his head, "I nearly died, but I reckon I won't live much longer either. It'll be a good thing if he doesn't go mad when he wakes up."
"Bai Weiwei cannot be saved."
Muyanjun's condition was utterly tragic, affecting every organ in his body.
Living without eating, sleeping, thinking, or moving, he's as lifeless as a corpse. By the end of two more days, he might as well join Bai Weiwei in the afterlife.
Xiao Mo turned to the grizzled old man, "You've protected my Overlord's life. If you can't do it again this time, I'll kill you myself."
Having said that, she turned around and left, heading towards the place where they would receive their punishment, silently enduring the consequences.
The old man sighed, "No wonder my master said one can't be a godly doctor even selling sweet potatoes; everyone treats me like a god, yet a god can't make someone who wants to die live on."
Muyanjun had only slept for two hours, and his eyes opened.
He was startled, his gaze unusually filled with panic, yet he found himself unable to move.
The old man saw that he had woken up, "I'm giving you an acupuncture treatment, you're exhausted both physically and mentally, but with care, you should soon meet your maker."
Muyanjun's eyes darkened, his face pale and gaunt, yet filled with malevolence, leaving those who saw him feeling chilled to the bone.
The old man gave him another acupuncture treatment, "I didn't intend to save you originally. After all, someone like you is vile and cruel, and who knows what chaos this could bring to the world if I were to revive you."
Muyanjun's voice was soft and eerie as he said, "Let me go."
The old man shook his head, "That won't work, I can't revive your beloved one, and saving you is compensation enough."
Muyanjun suddenly let out a bitter and intense laugh, "You can't pay for it, how could you ever pay for it? Even if you revived everyone in this world, it wouldn't be enough to pay for just a strand of her hair."
