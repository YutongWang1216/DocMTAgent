Chapter 455: Reversal 3
"This is just to let you experience the fluctuations in aura, it really is quite simple." Another sorcerer beside couldn't help but chime in with a smile.
"That would be greatly appreciated."
Lin Sheng nods.
"He needed to find the other fragments at the fastest speed possible, originally, he planned to summon more evil spirits and gain more pure灵魂 energy."
"However, now that such an opportunity has presented itself, acquiring it as quickly as possible is the most prudent course of action."
Soon, the Archmage led Lin Sheng to stand in front of a door guarded by an evil spirit.
Both of them reached out their hands and gently touched the frame of the evil spirit door simultaneously, closing their eyes.
The Archmage swiftly used his arcane abilities to begin constructing a spatial foundation, serving as a reference point for coordinates.
Then, following the ritual vibrations of the evil spirit door, accompanied by Lin Sheng's awareness, they were all launched out by the ritual vibrations.
"The ordinary teleportation ritual is point-to-point directional transmission."
"But when we usually explore other spatial mysteries, we transform this point-to-point approach into point-to-many."
"This just requires adjusting a small parameter on the teleportation base."
"Archmage led Lin Sheng's consciousness while imparting related techniques to him."
"In this way, the Evil Spirit Gate would naturally transmit our consciousness to multiple potential similar target spaces."
"This is essentially relying on energy to take a chance. If we're lucky, we can hit the space mystery we want right away. If not, we'll have to waste energy and try several times."
"Truly random enough."
Lin Sheng is speechless.
Upon his perception entering the Evil Spirit Gate, it was immediately swept outwards by the ritual vibrations within, scattering outwardly.
"At the same time, it felt like his consciousness was split, with his perception consciousness divided into over ten parts, simultaneously perceiving multiple completely different spatial atmospheres."
"In general, our consciousness struggles to maintain its integrity during teleportation, so we can only try to remember the spatial coordinates that the primary consciousness encounters."
"Coordinate memory requires us to leave a simple mark..."
Outside, the Archmage was still whispering explanations, guiding Lin Sheng and teaching him how to make a simple mark to determine the coordinate code.
He never anticipated that, due to the immense strength and resilience of the soul consciousness of the Soul Lock, after being split, he could recall the coordinates of all the spaces each of the over ten consciousnesses encountered.
It's just a matter of multitasking with over a dozen things at once. For Lin Sheng, who can handle multiple tasks with one mind, this isn't much of a challenge. He practices the skill of handling dozens of tasks daily.
Each summoning creature, he can control and observe through his split consciousness soul. So now, although he cannot control many summoning creatures independently at the same time.
Just by memorizing the aura fluctuations and setting down coordinates separately.
In addition to his soul being more resilient and lasting longer than most people, this aspect is quite manageable for him.
After ten minutes, the consciousness was depleted, dispersing away.
Lin Sheng opened his eyes and looked at the Archmage and the others.
"Guide me to the space mystery that corresponds to this coordinate," he immediately said, amidst the astonished gazes of the Archmage and the others.
The space mystery corresponding to this coordinate is precisely where Lin Sheng感知到 a space with fragments originating from the same source as the邪轮 turned sinister piece in his possession.
"Success on the first try?"
The Archmage felt a bitter taste in his heart. It had taken him a full two weeks just for his first perception of spatial essence, confirming the coordinates and recording them.
"It's a simple operation."
"Let's begin, establish the portal."
"I want to go over," Lin Sheng instructed.
"Yes."
"Wait for the original body."
The telepathic transmission of Tian Gong Xia's soul halted Lin Sheng's actions.
"What?"
As he watched the Archmage and the others instruct the evil spirits to move materials and resources over, he walked aside to wait, engaging in telepathic communication with Tian Gong Xia in his mind.
"There's a situation here. There's a significant change happening on Bisha Island!"
Tian Gong Xia's tone was subtly serious.
This is a sign that Lin Sheng has never seen before.
To know, back then, even when he told Tian Gong Xia about the existence of the Night King, she had never appeared so serious.
This gave him a sense of abnormal tension.
"Should the Moon Phase be at a significant disadvantage?"
Lin Sheng frowned and asked.
"Or perhaps new combat power has joined?"
"No, not new combat power," Tian Gong Xia solemnly said.
"Rather, it was the Moon Phase deceiving everyone!"
"What's going on? What's happening?"
"Seven-Locked Tower had summoned successfully long ago. The Moon Phase tricked everyone in all three secret realms. He had already successfully summoned Farudo! Using himself as a sacrifice! And merged with it!"
Lin Sheng's awareness momentarily paused.
"Offering oneself as a sacrifice?"
"...This madman!"
"So, the three secret realms are now facing a monstrous fusion creature of the Moon Phase and Farudo..."
Lin Sheng was speechless.
"What should we do now?"
"Tian Gong Xia spoke with gravity."
When Farudo merges with the Moon Phase, the combination isn't simply one plus one equals two; it's the result of multiplying three by ten.
"Don't get excited."
"For the Moon Phase and Farudo, their greatest adversaries are still the three secret realms and numerous major forces,"
"And this world isn't as straightforward as you think."
Lin Sheng thought about the information he had gathered before.
"The Great Star Pond, along with those individuals wielding celestial sacred artifacts, are not simple entities."
"As long as he doesn't provoke us, we don't bother to interfere with how they develop."
"I understand what you mean."
"Tian Gong Xia reminded, 'But it would be best to prepare early.'"
"I once possessed that level of destructive power. It was during the time I was under the control of the Magic Sword."
"So I'm very aware of the kind of consequences such power would bring about."
Lin Sheng remained silent.
Among all his commanders, Tian Gong Xia was the most peculiar one. Because Tian Gong Xia had once been influenced and controlled by some extraordinary and powerful entity.
At that time, even within her memory retracing, she realized Lin Sheng's prying.
Just a memory imprint, yet it was able to uncover Lin Sheng's prying into memories.
Such power has surpassed Lin Sheng's comprehension.
"I see," Lin Sheng replied once more.
"I will make preparations."
"Rest assured."
In the worst case, activate the strongest special state, summon all the commander powers, and integrate them into oneself.
Disconnecting from Tian Gong Xia, Lin Sheng quietly stared at the newly constructed demonic portal. His thoughts returned to his original line of thought.
"Open it, Excellency." The Archmage whispered.
Lin Sheng gazed at this portal, remaining silent for a moment.
"Bring the Fairy King over. And, Dedgar!"
Dedgar's magical hand was already nearby, waiting.
Upon hearing the summons, they immediately walked in from the door.
"Excellency, I will follow your orders."
Lin Sheng nods.
"I want to open multiple portals simultaneously, exploring several demonic realms."
"Select one hundred great demons, divide them into different group sizes, and send them out to explore试探性地 in a trial manner."
"Your orders shall be followed!"
"Dedgar felt a chill down his spine, realizing that perhaps His Excellency had encountered a turning point."
Otherwise, they wouldn't suddenly take such drastic, large-scale action to explore.
