Chapter 1303: As Long As You (1)
"What are you doing?!"
"Old Master Donggong tapped on his walking stick, his voice filled with anger."
"The ancestors will be here soon, please let Old Master Donggong calm down. Whatever you're planning, you'll understand once it happens." The man at the front replied.
"Old Master Donggong naturally knew who 'ancestors' he was referring to."
He was somewhat at a loss, wondering why Pei Yi had come.
Having issues with DK truly isn't anything good, even though everyone in R country wants to get DK out, but it's simply impossible.
"Just dreaming."
After a few minutes, Pei Yi's car arrived.
He got off the car, and his gaze shifted to the car not too far away.
"Upon seeing him, An Xiaolei didn't remove her mask or wig, and she also got down from the car."
"Wu Lianzhi followed closely behind."
"You're here." An Xiaolei said aloud.
Pei Yi sized her up from head to toe,难得发出笑声, walked up to her, leaned closer, and lowered his voice as he said, "Oh, these people can hardly guess it's you based on your outfit?"
"Of course, I just don't want them to know my identity, which is why I sent you. It's not the right time yet."
Pei Yi subconsciously glanced at Wu Lianzhi, "Why are you with him?"
"There's something."
He straightened his body, turned around, and said to the people from the East Palace family with a faint smile on his face, "I wonder which of my sister's actions offended the people from your East Palace family, making you all want to kill her?"
"What kind of courage do you have, growing to the top of your head?!"
The people from the East Palace family's expression changed instantly upon hearing this; it was Pei Yi's sister, wasn't it?
Where did Pei Yi get his sister from?
"Donggong Old Master spoke up, 'Mr. Pei's sister... we really don't know anything about her.'"
"If it's not too late to discuss, I'll tell you now."
Pei Yi said coldly, "Did you hear me clearly?"
"If Mr. Pei says this is your cousin, then please take her away. As for Prince Dongguo Lianzhi, since his name still appears in our clan register and he hasn't been removed for rebelling against his grandson, he is still considered part of our East Palace family. How we handle him is our East Palace family's business."
Before Pei Yi could answer, An Xiaolei took advantage of the situation and called out to him, "Brother, he's my boyfriend. I'm carrying his child now. You can't just leave him behind."
Pei Yi originally intended to only take her away, but now it's somewhat troublesome.
However, being arrogant and domineering is his style; anything he wants to do makes this trivial matter insignificant.
"Lady, you've heard me too. This... counts as my brother-in-law, really. They already have children together. Wouldn't it be unfair to let the kids grow up without a father if we hand them over to you?"
"Do you think I would agree?"
Donggong Old Master was well aware that once they handed the person over to Pei Yi, they would no longer be able to deal with their own grandson openly and justly. Therefore, despite feeling somewhat wary of DK's power, she couldn't afford to weaken her stance.
"Mr. Pei, I'm afraid that won't work. Our family has its own rules, and outsiders are not allowed to interfere with the handling of our own family members."
"You say he's the father of the child in my sister's belly? Are you just getting old and losing your hearing?"
Pei Yi turned his gaze towards Wu Lianzhi, "Tell me, are you a member of the East Palace family?"
"Early this morning, when my mother delivered poisoned food to me, I immediately severed our mother-daughter relationship. Prior to that, when the East Palace family tried to frame An Miss and me along with his subordinate as accidental deaths, I was already very clear on the situation. Although 'East Palace Lianzhi' still appears in the family register and the East Palace family's household registry, I am no longer of the East Palace family. Now, I am姓吴, Gou Lianzhi is my current name, and I am no longer a part of the East Palace family!"
Each word was powerful and resounding, every sentence exuding a chill.
Making such a statement in front of so many people demonstrates his determination.
"This isn't up to you to decide!" said Donggong Old Master, "Those who enter our East Palace family, are ours while alive, and ours even after death!"
"That old lady of the East Palace, I'd like to ask you, the plot to murder Miss An has been revealed to her. With you all in the mood to punish me here, aren't you concerned that S Nation might raise serious objections?"
The words came from Wu Lianzhi's mouth, spoken in a distant tone, without any fear.
"Pei Yi and I have had dealings before," Pei Yi smiled slightly, "She's the type who seeks revenge against her enemies. If you wish to harm her, do you think she would simply accept defeat?"
"Alright, let's skip the small talk. I have valuable time, so I'm taking both of them with me."
Seeing the East Palace family preparing to speak again, he added, "If you don't want any bloodshed here."
In this manner, the members of the East Palace family watched as the originally cooked duck flew away completely.
"Donggong Old Master and the patriarch were so enraged that they couldn't handle it."
In the end, Donggong Old Master directly spoke out, "Forget it, forget it, remove his name from the list, and cancel his household registration!"
"We need to return to S Nation."
Pei Yi glanced at her, "And then leave after using her?"
"Didn't you say you would agree to my request? I haven't even mentioned this, and now you're talking about going back home?"
"I'm hurrying back to the country for something important, but I do promise to fulfill your request. So, what's your request?"
"Yeah, my request might put you in a bit of a tough spot..."
"Then let's not bring it up. Just tell me something that wouldn't make me feel uncomfortable."
Pei Yi turned his body sideways, staring at her intently, "You really haven't changed at all, spend half a month with me."
"How should I accompany you?"
"Same as before."
An Xiaolei looked at him, "No way, first, can't put chains on me, can't restrict my freedom, second, two days is too long, half a month can do."
"..."
"That way, could I go back to the country first?"
"No."
Inside the car, An Xiaolei listened to their conversation, genuinely wondering if these two people were involved romantically.
Could there be an ambiguous relationship between these two individuals?
It just feels like it, no matter how you listen to it.
But if they were, then those two would be being too careless in front of him.
"That way, could I send him back to S Nation, while I stay with you alone?"
"I won't do anything to you two, let's go together." His words left no room for doubt.
An Xiaolei said nothing more.
Since it wasn't far from Qingping Mountain, they arrived quite quickly.
Returning to this place, there really are a myriad of emotions.
Upon seeing her, Qin Guo felt genuinely displeased, and as soon as they entered, she rolled her eyes.
Thinking about how her ancestors had brought back this pest again.
