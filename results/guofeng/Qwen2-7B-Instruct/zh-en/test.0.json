        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 1: A New Journey, a windstorm sweeps through a canyon, causing the plains to ripple. A wooden merchant ship, several dozen meters long, is seen flying in the air with its sails鼓胀 in the wind, moving forward slowly. This scene is observed by a middle-aged man in leather armor standing by the deck railings, admiring the vast landscape. He acknowledges the impressive windstorm and notes that for merchants, it presents a rare business opportunity.\n\nBeside him, a slightly plump merchant with strange curly hair and a merchant's robe calculates the potential profit from the view. He mentions that without this route, their goods might not have reached the central region so quickly. The merchant reveals that his initial plan to expand the market faced resistance but was ultimately correct.\n\nHowever, he cautions that choosing this path over the main waterway increases danger, noting recent unrest on the other side and the risk of sea serpents in the area. He seems concerned about potential dangers ahead. \n\nThe conversation turns serious as the businessman reassures the middle-aged man that risks come with the pursuit of wealth, which is why he paid a high price to hire him. He dismisses the fear of sea serpents, suggesting they are just a few snakes, and pats the man's shoulder in encouragement.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 1: A New Journey, a windstorm causes a wooden merchant ship, several dozen meters long, to fly through the air with its sails鼓胀 in the wind, moving forward slowly amidst the vast landscape. The scene is observed by a middle-aged man in leather armor and a plump merchant with strange curly hair, both discussing the implications of the storm on their business. The plump merchant calculates the potential profit from the unusual situation, acknowledging that this route would have delayed their goods reaching the central region. He initially faced resistance when trying to expand the market but realizes his decision was correct. However, he warns that choosing this path increases danger, pointing out recent unrest on the other side and the risk of sea serpents in the area. Despite the warnings, he reassures the middle-aged man that risks come with wealth, mentioning he paid a high price to hire him. He dismisses the concern about sea serpents, suggesting they are merely a few snakes, and encourages the man. Separately, a rescued young man, now in a deep sleep, was tended to by Licia, who bandaged his wounds. He had speculated about the cause of his injury, possibly involving a large, unusual lizard-like creature, leading to speculation about its existence in the Paffield northern region. Another character, Rhode, wakes up confused, recalling a battle with a Void Dragon in the Dragon Soul Continent where he was the first to kill it, earning achievements and receiving system notifications, suggesting a gaming context. However, upon his death, he experienced a sudden, inexplicable blackout, losing consciousness afterward, leading him to question whether there is an issue with the game or if he is still dreaming.",

A plump merchant, who initially faced resistance for expanding the market, now recognizes his decision as correct, though he acknowledges the increased danger posed by recent unrest and sea serpents in the area. Despite these warnings, he reassures a middle-aged man that risks are inherent to wealth, mentioning the high price paid for the man's services. Separately, Licia tends to a rescued young man who was injured, possibly by a large, unusual creature, leading to speculation about its existence in the Paffield northern region. Meanwhile, Rhode awakens in an unfamiliar place, unsure if he is still within a game or has transitioned to reality. Confused and physically injured, Rhode realizes that the absence of pain rules out the game scenario, indicating that his current state is genuine. He notices similarities between his real body and the avatar from the game, noting its weakness and paleness due to lack of sunlight. Rhode observes a small, poorly lit room resembling a cabin with minimal furnishings, no lights, phone, or call button, and feels a sense of familiarity. Suddenly, a blonde girl in white robes enters the room, surprised to find Rhode half-sitting up.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 1: A New Journey, a windstorm causes a wooden merchant ship, bound for the central region, to be propelled through the sky, resulting in delayed deliveries. A plump merchant, who had previously faced opposition for expanding his market, now sees his decision as justified, acknowledging the heightened dangers from recent unrest and sea serpents. He reassures a middle-aged man about the inevitability of risk in pursuit of wealth. Meanwhile, Licia cares for a young man she rescued, who was possibly harmed by a large, mysterious creature, sparking speculation about its existence in the Paffield northern region. Separately, Rhode wakes up in an unfamiliar environment, unsure whether he is still within a game or has transitioned to reality. Confused and physically injured, Rhode realizes that the absence of pain indicates his current state is genuine. He notices similarities between his real body and his avatar from the game, noting its weakness and paleness due to lack of sunlight. Rhode observes a small, poorly lit room that resembles a cabin, devoid of lights, phone, or call button, and feels a sense of familiarity. Suddenly, a blonde girl in white robes enters the room, surprised to find Rhode half-sitting up.\n\nThe girl, speaking Nimic, one of the official languages of Dragon Soul Continent, greets Rhode, asking about his well-being and expressing concern over his severe injuries. Rhode, initially perplexed, realizes she is referring to an incident two days prior where he collapsed in the Paffield wilderness due to serious injuries, which were only narrowly avoided thanks to the intervention of the passing 'Silver Balance' merchant ship. The girl, identified as a blonde with twin tails, explains that Rhode's left body sustained significant damage during an unknown conflict, suggesting it was potentially perilous. Rhode recalls that during his final battle against the Void Dragon, it was indeed his left side that was attacked, but he clarifies that the injury occurred within the game, not in real life. Despite the chaotic circumstances, Rhode demonstrates psychological resilience, showcasing his status as a high-level player and leader of the world's strongest MMO guild. Rhode learns that he was rescued by the Silver Balance trading company's airship while lying injured on the plains of Paffield. The girl mentions that, despite his initial critical condition, Rhode exhibited impressive recovery abilities.",
