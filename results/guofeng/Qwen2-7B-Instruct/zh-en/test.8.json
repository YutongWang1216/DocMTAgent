The Archmage guides Lin Sheng to a door protected by an evil spirit, both touching the frame simultaneously and closing their eyes. The Archmage constructs a spatial foundation using arcane abilities to serve as a reference point. They then use the vibrations from the evil spirit door and Lin Sheng's awareness to launch them into various potential target spaces through teleportation.\n\nThe teleportation ritual initially works as a point-to-point directional transmission, but it's transformed into a point-to-many method during exploration. This transformation involves adjusting a minor parameter on the teleportation base. The Archmage leads Lin Sheng's consciousness and imparts the necessary techniques, allowing the Evil Spirit Gate to transmit their consciousness to multiple similar target spaces. This process relies on energy and is essentially a gamble; if successful, it quickly leads to the desired space mystery; otherwise, it consumes energy and requires multiple attempts. The Archmage ensures that the teleportation is truly random, increasing the chances of hitting the correct space mystery.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 455 titled 'Reversal 3', a sorcerer instructs Lin Sheng on experiencing aura fluctuations, finding the process straightforward, which Lin Sheng appreciates. The Archmage then guides Lin Sheng to a door protected by an evil spirit, both touching the frame simultaneously and closing their eyes. Using arcane abilities, the Archmage constructs a spatial foundation as a reference point to teleport Lin Sheng into various potential target spaces. Initially, the teleportation ritual functions as a point-to-point method, but during exploration, it transforms into a point-to-many approach by adjusting a minor parameter on the teleportation base. The Archmage leads Lin Sheng's consciousness, imparting necessary techniques to enable the Evil Spirit Gate to transmit Lin Sheng's consciousness to multiple similar target spaces. This process relies on energy and is essentially a gamble, requiring multiple attempts if successful, as it quickly leads to the desired space mystery; otherwise, it consumes energy. The Archmage ensures the teleportation is truly random, increasing the chances of hitting the correct space mystery.\n\nSurprisingly, due to the unique circumstances, Lin Sheng's consciousness splits, allowing him to perceive multiple different spatial atmospheres simultaneously. This is unusual as consciousness typically struggles to maintain its integrity during teleportation, usually relying on remembering spatial coordinates encountered by the primary consciousness. The archmage explains how to make a simple mark for coordinate memory, and due to the soul consciousness of the Soul Lock being strong and resilient, Lin Sheng's consciousness split allows each part to recall the coordinates of the spaces encountered. This makes multitasking with multiple consciousnesses possible, although not all summoning creatures can be controlled independently at once. Lin Sheng, adept at managing multiple tasks mentally, uses this ability to memorize aura fluctuations and set down coordinates separately. His soul's resilience and longevity contribute to this process.\n\nAfter ten minutes, the consciousness disperses, leaving Lin Sheng ready to guide the archmage and others to the space mystery corresponding to the coordinates. The target space is identified as one with fragments originating from the same source as a sinister piece in Lin Sheng's possession. The archmage is surprised by the success of the first attempt, noting that his own first perception took two weeks to confirm and record coordinates. Lin Sheng then instructs to begin establishing a portal, preparing to proceed to the identified space mystery.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 455 titled 'Reversal 3', a sorcerer teaches Lin Sheng about aura fluctuations, making the process simple enough for him to appreciate. The Archmage then leads Lin Sheng through a teleportation ritual protected by an evil spirit, using arcane abilities to construct a spatial foundation as a reference point. Initially, the teleportation is point-to-point but adjusts to become point-to-many upon exploration by tweaking a minor parameter. The Archmage guides Lin Sheng's consciousness to transmit it to multiple similar target spaces, a process reliant on energy and akin to a gamble. Despite the risk, the teleportation ensures true randomness, increasing the likelihood of reaching the correct space mystery. Surprisingly, due to unique circumstances, Lin Sheng's consciousness splits, enabling him to perceive multiple spatial atmospheres simultaneously. The archmage instructs Lin Sheng on marking coordinates for spatial memory, utilizing his soul's resilience and strength to recall encountered spaces. After ten minutes, the consciousness disperses, leaving Lin Sheng prepared to guide the archmage and others to the identified space mystery. The target space is revealed to contain fragments from the same source as a sinister piece Lin Sheng possesses. The archmage is impressed by the success of the first attempt, noting that his own initial confirmation took two weeks. Lin Sheng then instructs to start establishing a portal to proceed to the identified space mystery. Simultaneously, a telepathic alert from Tian Gong Xia informs Lin Sheng of a critical situation on Bisha Island, indicating a significant change. Tian Gong Xia's unusual seriousness suggests an unprecedented level of tension, leading Lin Sheng to question if there is a significant disadvantage or new combat power. Tian Gong Xia clarifies that it's not new combat power but a deception by the Moon Phase. She explains that the Moon Phase tricked all participants in the three secret realms into thinking they were summoning Farudo, when in fact, Farudo was already summoned using the Moon Phase as a sacrifice and merged with it. This revelation leaves Lin Sheng momentarily stunned, realizing the magnitude of the situation - the three secret realms are now facing a monstrous fusion creature of the Moon Phase and Farudo.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 455 titled 'Reversal 3', a sorcerer simplifies the concept of aura fluctuations for Lin Sheng, making it accessible enough for him to understand. The Archmage then conducts a teleportation ritual protected by an evil spirit, using arcane abilities to establish a spatial foundation as a reference point. Initially, the teleportation is point-to-point, but it adjusts to become point-to-many upon tweaking a minor parameter. The Archmage guides Lin Sheng's consciousness to transmit it to multiple similar target spaces, a process relying on energy and akin to a gamble. This teleportation ensures true randomness, increasing the likelihood of reaching the correct space mystery. Due to unique circumstances, Lin Sheng's consciousness splits, allowing him to perceive multiple spatial atmospheres simultaneously. After marking coordinates for spatial memory, utilizing his soul's resilience and strength to recall encountered spaces, Lin Sheng is left prepared to guide the Archmage and others to the identified space mystery. The target space contains fragments from the same source as a sinister piece Lin Sheng possesses. The Archmage is impressed by the success of the first attempt, noting that his own initial confirmation took two weeks. Lin Sheng then instructs to start establishing a portal to proceed to the identified space mystery. Meanwhile, Tian Gong Xia alerts Lin Sheng to a critical situation on Bisha Island, indicating a significant change. Tian Gong Xia's unusual seriousness suggests an unprecedented level of tension, leading Lin Sheng to question if there is a significant disadvantage or new combat power. Tian Gong Xia clarifies that it's not new combat power but a deception by the Moon Phase. She explains that the Moon Phase tricked all participants in the three secret realms into thinking they were summoning Farudo, when in fact, Farudo was already summoned using the Moon Phase as a sacrifice and merged with it. Tian Gong Xia emphasizes that this is not a simple addition but rather a multiplication of forces, suggesting the complexity of the situation. She advises against excitement and cautions that the Moon Phase and Farudo face significant challenges from secret realms and major forces. Tian Gong Xia mentions the Great Star Pond and individuals with celestial sacred artifacts, noting they're not simple entities and shouldn't be interfered with unless provoked. She acknowledges the immense destructive power and its grave consequences, revealing insights beyond Lin Sheng's understanding. Lin Sheng acknowledges these points and decides to prepare accordingly.",
