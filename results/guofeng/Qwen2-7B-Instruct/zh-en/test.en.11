Chapter 834: Returning to the Holy Land (Part 2)
"Phoenix."
Inside the bamboo house, Baiyan was watching Bai Xiaochen and Little Dragonling playing around. Suddenly, she heard a commotion outside and her brows lightly furrowed, "What happened outside? Why is there a loud noise?"
"You go out and take a look."
Phoenix curled her fists, received the order, and stepped back. After a while, she pushed open the door of the bamboo house and walked in, hesitantly saying, "Queen, there are two people outside, they're here for you..."
"Find me?"
"White Face raised his eyebrows, "Then I'll go out and see who's looking for me."
After speaking, she slowly stood up from the chair and headed towards the door.
Outside the house, under the blood-red sky, the two trembled as they crawled forward. Perhaps having traveled too much distance on their crawl, a blood trail was left beneath them. This vivid crimson path caught White Face's eye, standing out particularly starkly.
"What are you doing?"
"White Face's brows lightly furrowed as she asked coldly."
Elder Deacon II had a pale face, his trembling body prostrate on the ground as he stammered, "Queen, I've come to take responsibility for my actions by bearing the brunt of your punishment. On that day, I was misled by that impostor, causing the Queen to misunderstand the King. Everything is my fault; please mete out your punishment upon me."
"No, Queen, it's my fault. I failed to deliver the King's orders to you. In fact, on that day, the King left the palace to lift the seal on the妖界, and he asked me to return to inform you. But I couldn't fulfill this task, which allowed the evil people to take advantage of the situation."
Firefeather knelt on the ground with tears all over his face: "All the mistakes are mine. Queen, you can beat or scold me as you wish, I have no objections." He took the bamboo strip behind him in his hands, supported it with both palms, and handed it to White Face before bowing his head deeply, his expression showing a determination to meet death with calmness.
White Face's hand slowly closed around the bamboo strip that Firefeather had brought to her. Her expression was calm, and there was a piercing light in her eyes that was hard to fathom.
As if sensing the bamboo strip slipping away, Firefeather's body froze. He gritted his teeth tightly, awaiting the decisive strike that would be as forceful as a bamboo shoot breaking through the soil.
However...
After a long while, no pain was felt.
Firefeather was taken aback as she looked up, only to see a flame emerge from the bamboo strip in White Face's hand, which instantly turned into ashes.
"You've suffered quite a bit crawling this whole way?"
"King... Queen?"
Firefeather looked at White Face bewilderedly, perhaps not understanding the meaning behind her words.
"Given that, then your punishment has been served. Stand up."
"White Face is always clear in her actions. She targets only those who妄图 harm her."
On that day, they could deceive her, so how much more so the Great Elder and Firefeather? That's why, she never blamed them...
Firefeather's body was rigid like iron, unable to believe that White Face had so easily let them off the hook.
Before coming, they had already prepared for being utterly battered!
"Now, she didn't even strike them, yet she absolved them of their sins."
Seeing the two motionless kneeling there, Baiyan's expression turned slightly stern: "What?"
"You're still waiting for me to help you stand up?"
The woman's sharp voice echoed in Firefeather's ears, causing him to immediately leap to his feet. Blood stains marred his pants, and he struggled to maintain his balance.
Thus, he remained standing, despite his legs trembling continuously, refusing to kneel again.
Baiyan glanced at the two struggling individuals, then pointed to the stone seat on the ground, "Sit down, you can rest for a bit before you head back down the mountain."
