Despite understanding the situation, the Overseer refuses to confront reality, instead convincing himself that Bai Weiwei has merely fallen asleep. Xiao Mo believes the Overseer will only return to his senses once Bai Weiwei's body begins to decompose, indicating her death. Meanwhile, Muyanjun stays by Bai Weiwei's side, showing signs of increasing concern. An old, divine physician arrives, having chewed on a heart-protecting pill, and informs Muyanjun that Bai Weiwei fell asleep after taking medicine. The physician suggests it's time for Muyanjun to assess if Bai Weiwei will awaken soon. The discussion reveals that the unusual situation requires no treatment but emphasizes the importance of treating another individual, which catches Muyanjun's attention.",
