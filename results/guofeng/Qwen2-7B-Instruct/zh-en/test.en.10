Chapter 805: The Last Story
"In the East campus?"
Zhou Tu clearly hesitated for a moment. Whether it was seniors or teachers, they had all warned freshmen not to approach the East campus. They didn't specify the reasons, but from their tone of voice, one could infer that the East campus was very dangerous.
"You have a deep misunderstanding about the East campus. In reality, it's quite similar to here. The difference lies in the completely different management styles of the two campuses. They live in the real terror, while you live in the false happiness."
Chen Ge looked into Zhou Tu's eyes: "Compared to you, they are actually closer to hope because they at least know who they are and how to find liberation."
Chen Ge did not deceive Zhou Tu; whether they were students from the East campus or the West campus, they were all trapped in this school.
"The students at the West campus have their memories altered, living out lives crafted by unseen forces. At least, the students at the East campus are aware of seeking scapegoats and finding ways to escape."
"Are the students at the East campus closer to hope?"
"But I heard that only unwanted trash from the West campus gets sent there,"
Zhou Tu has been convinced, but he still feels uneasy inside.
"Regardless of what the criteria are, any school that treats students as trash must be a school full of trash."
Chen Ge pointed at the tall fence between the two campuses with his finger: "Do you know why that wall exists?"
"Why?"
"Because the school fears losing control, they use various methods to re-shape humanity, but they forget that humanity is the most complex thing in this world."
"The events have already taken place, no matter how one tries to forget, the scars will always be etched in the heart."
"Remembering nothing doesn't mean they don't exist; hence, some of this school's plans are destined to fail."
Chen Ge spoke in a way that some club members couldn't understand. They didn't know why Chen Ge said so, but they felt that there might be some truth to what he was saying.
"Children's curiosity is inherently heavy, and Chen Ge kept telling them the truth about this school, successfully sparking the interest of the club members."
"That means we should go now?"
"Frankly speaking, I really can't believe that the East campus would have the art studio of my dreams," Zhou Tu whispered.
"It's not the right time yet."
Chen Ge turned his head back to look at the shadow, noting that the shadow in room 413 was still asleep, yet his body had undergone significant changes.
If one were to look closely, it would be observed that Chen Ge's shadow was distinct from others; it was pitch-black, as dark as ink, as if all light that fell upon it was swallowed up.
It seems to have become much stronger.
The large potential of the black shadow is good news for Chen Ge. Once he awakens, Chen Ge will lead the students back to the East campus to once again target the solitary ghost for attack.
By doing so, I can strengthen my own power, and secondly, stir up the stagnant waters of the school, providing cover for another "killer" hiding within the academy.
"Now it's still a time to build strength. Before the school owner notices this little insect, I want to prepare as many trump cards as possible for myself."
Chen Ge turned his head to look at Wang Yicheng. He had gathered stories about the other three club members, leaving only this first member who had joined with a limp: "Our next destination is Wang Yicheng's dormitory."
"Go to my dormitory?"
After hearing this, Wang Yicheng's reaction was somewhat strange. He shook his hands repeatedly, "Let's not bother, there's nothing much to see in the dormitory where I live."
"You raise your voice, speak faster, and have uncertain eyes when you say this; it seems you're really not good at lying, kid."
Chen Ge gently wrapped his arm around Wang Yicheng's shoulder: "Why don't you want us to come over?"
"What are you worried we'll see?"
"I..."
Wang Yicheng pondered for a long time but didn't know how to express himself, eventually looking elsewhere: "Nothing, let's just go directly."
"Alright."
Wang Yicheng lives in dormitory 413 at the West campus, while Lin Sisi lives in dormitory 413 at the East campus.
The dormitory numbers are identical, but in the West campus' 413 dormitory, there are students occupying all beds except bed number four. Conversely, in the East campus' 413 dormitory, only bed number four has someone, while the other beds are empty.
"Let's keep our club's secrets to ourselves and try to be a bit low-key. There are teachers like me in this school, as well as those who aren't as easy to deal with."
Chen Ge remained vigilant, the commotion they caused in the laboratory building was too loud, and the school authorities were likely to have already begun investigating.
"There isn't much time left for me. After checking out Dormitory 413, we should lay low for a while."
The West campus has four male dormitory buildings, housing several times more students than the East campus. It's still before curfew, which makes it the liveliest time for the male dormitory buildings. Showering sounds, the clatter of plastic buckets, and conversations can all be heard clearly from the ground floor.
"This building is similar to the East campus."
Chen Ge acted naturally, walking in behind the four students as they entered the first building together.
The small house where the dorm supervisor lives is tightly closed, but the glass windows are open. Inside, a middle-aged woman in her fifties is humming, and she appears to be in a good mood.
Next to the small window, there is a notice张贴 stating that the use of high-power electrical appliances is strictly prohibited for students in the dormitories, and students are forbidden to cook in the dormitories.
"I remember reading on the announcement board of the East campus dormitory that there have been recent violent incidents, and students are now prohibited from leaving after lights out."
Just one wall apart, it felt like two entirely different worlds, akin to being inside a "door" and outside of it.
Passing through the corridor, Chen Ge and several club members arrived at the entrance of room 413.
"This dormitory is no different from others."
Wang Yicheng opened the door, and once he entered the room, it seemed as if the other occupants ignored him completely, going about their business as usual without a single word directed towards him.
As Wang Yicheng took a few steps inside, the boy sleeping by the bed next to the door suddenly pulled back his mosquito net and glared at him: "How many times have I told you?"
"Come in and close the door behind you, or are your legs so bad that you can't hear either?"
The boy spoke rudely, and he didn't know why he seemed to dislike Wang Yicheng very much.
"Perhaps he doesn't close the door because someone else will enter soon. If you need an apology, we a few could apologize for him, just not sure what form of apology you prefer?"
Chen Ge grasped the doorknob and entered the room, casting a glance at the other occupants of the dormitory.
The boy under the mosquito net immediately cowered upon seeing Chen Ge, remained silent, and pulled the mosquito net closed with a dark expression.
"Teacher Bai, this is Bed Four. We use it to store luggage since no one occupies it."
Wang Yicheng pointed at Bed Four, where several suitcases were strewn about. Only his belongings were placed under his own bed in this dormitory; everyone else had scattered their items and luggage on Bed Four.
Chen Ge was familiar with Bed Four, as he had actually slept on it himself in the East campus.
Approaching Bed Four, although it was unoccupied, it was still adorned with bedding and sheets. However, these bed linens were now soiled due to the presence of luggage and miscellaneous items.
