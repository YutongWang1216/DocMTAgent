        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 805 titled \"The Last Story\", Zhou Tu expresses hesitation when considering visiting the East campus, due to warnings from seniors and teachers about its dangers. Chen Ge corrects Zhou Tu's understanding, stating that while the management styles differ, both campuses share the same underlying issue—students being trapped within the school. He argues that students at the East campus are closer to hope because they are aware of their situation and seek ways to escape, unlike those at the West campus whose memories are altered, making them unaware of their predicament. Zhou Tu acknowledges this, yet remains uneasy, emphasizing that treating students as trash is indicative of a problematic institution. Chen Ge further explains that the existence of a barrier between the two campuses serves as a symbol of the school's fear of losing control and its misguided attempts to reshape humanity. He suggests that some of the school's plans inevitably fail due to the complexity of human nature and the lasting impact of past events on individuals' hearts. Zhou Tu's decision to act seems influenced by Chen Ge's revelations, indicating a potential shift towards action based on newfound insights.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 805, titled \"The Last Story,\" Zhou Tu hesitates to visit the East campus, influenced by warnings from seniors and teachers about its dangers. However, Chen Ge clarifies that despite the differences in management style, both campuses share a common issue where students are trapped within the school. Chen Ge points out that students at the East campus are closer to hope, as they are aware of their situation and actively seek ways to escape, unlike those at the West campus, whose memories have been altered, making them unaware of their predicament. Zhou Tu acknowledges this, but remains uneasy, emphasizing that treating students as trash is indicative of a problematic institution. Chen Ge further discusses how the barrier between the two campuses symbolizes the school's fear of losing control and its misguided attempts to reshape humanity. He also suggests that some of the school's plans inevitably fail due to the complexity of human nature and the lasting impact of past events on individuals' hearts. Zhou Tu's decision to act seems influenced by Chen Ge's revelations, hinting at a potential shift towards action based on newfound insights. Separately, Chen Ge notices significant changes in the shadow of room 413, indicating an increase in strength and distinctiveness, which is positive. He plans to lead students back to the East campus to target a solitary ghost, aiming to strengthen his power and stir up the school's stagnant atmosphere. Chen Ge intends to prepare as many advantages as possible before the school owner notices. He questions Wang Yicheng about joining their club, observing inconsistencies in his response and suspecting he might not be a good liar. Wang Yicheng avoids revealing details about what they might find in his dorm, suggesting something secretive. Chen Ge accepts this and notes the similarity in dormitory numbers between Wang Yicheng's and Lin Sisi's rooms, though the occupancy differs between the two campuses. Chen Ge decides to keep the club's secrets and be discreet, acknowledging the presence of both approachable and challenging teachers in the school.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In Chapter 805, \"The Last Story,\" Zhou Tu is deterred from visiting the East campus due to warnings about its risks, but Chen Ge explains that both campuses share a common issue where students are trapped within the institution. Students at the East campus are more aware of their situation and actively seek escape, unlike those at the West campus, whose memories have been altered, leaving them oblivious to their plight. Chen Ge further discusses how the barrier between the two campuses symbolizes the school's fear of losing control and its misguided attempts to reshape humanity. He mentions that some of the school's plans inevitably fail due to the complexity of human nature and the lasting impact of past events on individuals' hearts. Zhou Tu's decision to act seems influenced by Chen Ge's revelations, hinting at a potential shift towards action based on newfound insights.\n\nChen Ge notices significant changes in the shadow of room 413, indicating an increase in strength and distinctiveness, which is positive. He plans to lead students back to the East campus to target a solitary ghost, aiming to strengthen his power and stir up the school's stagnant atmosphere. Before the school owner notices, Chen Ge intends to prepare as many advantages as possible. He questions Wang Yicheng about joining their club, observing inconsistencies in his response and suspecting he might not be a good liar. Wang Yicheng avoids revealing details about what they might find in his dorm, suggesting something secretive. Chen Ge accepts this and notes the similarity in dormitory numbers between Wang Yicheng's and Lin Sisi's rooms, though the occupancy differs between the two campuses. Chen Ge decides to keep the club's secrets and be discreet, acknowledging the presence of both approachable and challenging teachers in the school. \n\nMeanwhile, aware of the noise causing investigation from school authorities, Chen Ge suggests rushing to Dormitory 413 before they're discovered. The West campus' four male dormitory buildings are bustling due to the absence of curfew. Chen Ge enters Dormitory 413 with four students, noting the strict rules against high-power appliances and cooking. He contrasts the seemingly normal scene at the West campus with recent violent incidents at the East campus. Upon arrival, Chen Ge finds Dormitory 413 to be no different, though the residents ignore him. A boy near the door angrily confronts Wang Yicheng, who seems disliked by him. Chen Ge, noticing the boy's hostile reaction, explains that perhaps the door is left open for another visitor soon, suggesting they apologize on his behalf if needed. The boy under the mosquito net immediately retreats, closes it, and remains silent. Chen Ge informs Bai Teacher that Bed Four is used for storing luggage, as it's unoccupied, while Wang Yicheng's belongings are under his own bed, unlike others who scatter theirs across Bed Four.",
