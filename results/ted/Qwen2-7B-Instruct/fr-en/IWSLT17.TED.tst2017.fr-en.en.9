"Hand up: how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook because they made an offensive comment about politics, religion, parenting, or food?"
"How many of you avoid at least one person just to not have to talk to them?"
"Previously, to have a polite conversation, one followed the advice of Henry Higgins in 'My Fair Lady': stick to the weather and your health."
"But nowadays, with climate change and the anti-vaccination movement, these topics... are no longer very safe."
"Theworldinwhichweslive,thistheworldwheretocanyconversationcanpotentiallyevolveencontroversy,wherenoweascannotcommunicate,andalwaysthesubjectsmosttrivialhavepartisansanddetractors,thisworldisnotnormal."
"Pew Research conducted a study on 10,000 American adults and found that, currently, we are more polarized, more divided than ever before."
"We make fewer compromises, which means we don't listen to each other."
"We decide where to live, whom to marry, and even who will be our friends, based on our already established beliefs."
"Again, it doesn't mean that we don't listen to each other."
"A conversation requires a balance between speaking and listening, and somewhere along the way, we have lost this balance."
"It's partly due to technology."
"The cell phones that you all have, either in your hands, or close enough to be able to grab them quickly."
According to Pew Research, about one third of American teenagers send more than 100 SMS per day.
"Most of them, in fact, will probably send a text message to their friends rather than talking to them face-to-face."
"There is a great article in the magazine 'The Atlantic'"
written by Paul Barnwell, a high school teacher.
His students have done a communication project.
"He wanted to teach them to speak about a particular subject without notes."
"He said this: 'I realized...'"
"I realized that the ability to hold a conversation might be the skill we neglect the most to teach."
Children spend hours dialoguing and expressing ideas through screens, but they rarely have the opportunity to hone their interpersonal communication skills.
It might seem strange, but we must ask ourselves: in the 21st century, is there a skill more important than knowing how to have a coherent conversation?
My job is to speak to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, presidents, plumbers.
"I talk to people I like and others I don't like."
"I talk to people with whom I am deeply at odds."
"But I always have fantastic conversations with them."
During the next 10 minutes, I would like to teach you how to speak and listen.
Many of you have probably heard advice on this topic: look people in the eye, think in advance about interesting topics to approach, look, nod, and smile to show your attention, repeat what you've heard or summarize it.
"Forget all that."
"It's crap."
"There's no reason to learn how to demonstrate that you're attentive if you're actually already attentive."
I use exactly the same skills as a professional interviewer in my everyday life.
I will therefore teach you how to question people, and it will help you learn how to be better communicators.
"Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time, without getting bored, and most importantly, without offending anyone."
We have all had extraordinary conversations before.
"We've had them. We know what it is."
"The kind of conversation that makes you feel involved and inspired, or gives you the impression of really creating a bond, or of having been perfectlyly understood."
"There's's no reason that the majority of our conversations shouldn't be like this."
"I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to explain them honestly to you, if you take one and master it completely, you will already have better conversations."
Number 1: no multitasking.
"Not just putting down their phone, tablet, car keys, or whatever they have in their hands."
"Be present."
Live in the moment.
Do not think about the argument with your boss,
neither about what you're going to eat tonight.
"If you want to end the conversation, do so, but don't be half-present."
Number 2: Don't give lectures.
"If you want to express your opinion, without any opportunity to respond, discuss, react or grow, write a blog."
"I have a very good reason for not inviting critics to my show: they are very boring."
The conservatives will hate Obama, the stamp eatersers and abortion.
The liberals will hate the big banks, the oil industry, and Dick Cheney.
"Completely predictable."
"YouYou don't want to be like this."
"You must start every conversation with the idea that you are going to learn something."
Scott Peck, the renowned therapist, said that true listening requires self-effacement.
This means sometimes setting aside one's's own opinion.
"He said that the speaker will feel this acceptance, and become less and less vulnerable, and is more likely to offer the hidden corners of his mind to the listener."
Consider that there are things to learn.
Bill Nye: "Everyone knows something you don't."
I say it this way: every person is an expert in something.
Number 3: Ask open-ended questions.
"For that, inspire yourself from journalists."
Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why, or how.
If you ask a complex question, the answer will be simple.
"If I ask you: 'Were you terrified?'"
"Youyou will answer with the strongest word in this sentence, here 'terrified', and the answer will be yes or no."
" Were you angry?" "Yes, very angry."
Let them describe. That's what they know.
Ask questions such as: "How was things?"
"What did you feel?"
Because they might need a moment of reflection and then you will have a much more interesting answer.
Number 4: Follow the flow.
"That means that ideas will come to your mind and you must let them leave your mind."
We often hear interviews where the guest speaks for several minutes, then the host takes over and asks a question that seems to come out of nowhere, or to which the answer has already been given.
The host had probably stopped listening 2 minutes earlier as they were thinking about their next question, a very smart question that they were determined to ask.
"We do the same thing."
"We are sitting, chatting with someone, then we remember our encounter with Hugh Jackman at a cafe."
"We stop listening."
Stories and ideas will come to you.
"YouYou need to let them come, then depart."
Number 5: if you don't know, say that you don't know.
"People on the radio, particularly on NPR, are more conscious of what they say being recorded; hence, they are more cautious when they they mention their expertise and what they they are sure they know."
"Act the same way. Proceed with extra caution."
The word should not be taken lightly.
Number 6: Do not compare your experience to theirs.
"If they speak about the loss of a family member, do not speak about the loss of a family member."
"If they talk about the problems they have at work, don't tell them that you hate your job."
It's never the same thing.
Every experience is unique.
More importantly, it's not about you.
No need to use this moment to prove how great you are or how much you've suffered.
"Someone asked Stephen Hawking for his IQ, to which he replied: 'No idea. Those who boast of their IQ are idiots.'"
Conversations are not promotional opportunities.
Number 10: try not to repeat yourself.
It's condescending and very boring, and we tend to do it.
"Especially during work conversations or with our children, we have a message to convey so we constantly rephrase it."
Don't do that.
Number 8: Spare the details.
Frankly, it doesn't matter the years, names, dates, and all these details you can't remember.
Frankly, what matters is you.
People are interested in you, in what you have in common.
Forget the details. Leave them aside.
Number 9: it's not the last, but it's the most important.
Listen.
I cannot tell you how many important people have said that listening might be the most important skill to develop.
Buddha said, and I paraphrase: "If your mouth is open, you're not learning."
"And Calvin Coolidge said: 'No one has ever been fired for listening.'"
Why don't we listen to each other?
Firstly, we prefer to speak.
"When I speak, I have control."
I don't have to hear what doesn't interest me.
I am the center of attention.
I can highlight my identity.
But there's more to it: we get distracted.
We speak on average 225 words per minute, but we can listen up to 500.
Therefore, our minds complete with 225 other words.
I know that it takes effort and energy to give someone your full attention, but if you don't do that, it's not a conversation,
but rather two people shouting barely connected phrases in the same place.
"YouYou must listen to each other."
Stephen Covey said it very well:
"Many of us do not listen to understand."
"We listen to respond."
A final rule, number 10: be brief.
"A good conversation is's like a little skirt: short enough to hold attention, and long enough to cover the topic. - My sister" It all boils down to a basic concept: get interested in others.
I grew up with a very famous grandfather and there was a ritual at my house.
People would come to speak to my grandparents and after they had left, my mother would come to see us and say: "Do you know who it was?
She was the finalist of Miss America.
That was the mayor of Sacramento.
"SheShe won a Pulitzer Prize. She is a Russian ballet dancer."
I grew up believing that everyone has a hidden and absolutely amazing side.
I believe this makes me a better host.
I keep my mouth shut as much as possible, I keep an open mind and I'm always ready to be amazed and I'm never disappointed.
Do the same.
"Go talk to people, listen to them, and most importantly, be ready to be amazed."
Thank you.
