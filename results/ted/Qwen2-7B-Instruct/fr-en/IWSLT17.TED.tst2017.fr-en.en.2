I come from one of the most liberal, tolerant, progressive places in the United States: Seattle, in the state of Washington.
I grew up with a family of big Seattleites.
My mother was an artist, my father a university professor, and I am grateful for my childhood, because I have always been entirely comfortable living my life as it seemed fit.
Actually, I took a path that wasn't not the one that my parents had had imagined.
At 19, I dropped out of university -- dropped out, kicked out, cutting my hair short.
I went on tour as a professional horn player, which was always my dream.
I played chamber music across the United States and Europe, I was on tour for 2 years with a great jazz player: Charlie Bird.
Approaching my 30s, I ended up as a member of the symphony orchestra in Barcelona.
What a life!
My parents never complained.
They supported me throughout.
It wasn't not their dream.
They would tell their neighbors and friends: "Our son is taking a decade sabbatical."
And - There was was, however, an awkward conversation about my lifestyle that I'd like to talk about.
I was 27 years old, I had returned from Barcelona, I was at my parents's for Christmas, I was preparing dinner with my mother and we were alone in the kitchen.
And she was silent, too silent.
Something was off.
I said: "Mum, what are you thinking?"
She said: "Your father and I are worried about you."
I said: "What? What could it be?"
And she said: "I want you to be completely honest: have you voted Republican?"
Actually, I wasn't not very political, I was just a horn player.
I had an epiphany, they had perceived it and it caused confusion.
I had become an enthusiast of capitalism and I want to explain what it is.
This stemmed from the interest I've always had in, believe it or not, poverty.
"When I was a child, growing up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw real poverty."
"We were a family from the lower middle class, but, of course, this is not real poverty."
It's far from that.
"TheFirst time I saw poverty and its face, I was 6 or 7 years old, at the beginning of the 70s."
"And, like for many of you, it was a mundane and typical example."
It was a photograph in National Geographic of a child around my age in eastern Africa, there were flies on their face and a swollen belly.
He wasn't going to make it, I knew it and I was powerless.
"Some of you may remember this image, not exactly this one, but a similar one."
She revealed the black misery to the West.
This vision haunted me as I grew up, went to school, dropped out, did other things, and founded a family.
"And I wondered what had happened to this child"
"or others like him around the world."
"And I was studied, even though I wasn't not at university, I was looking for an answer: what was happening to the poorest people of the world?"
Was it getting worse, improving? What?
"I found the answer and it changed my life, and I want to share it with you."
"Look - most Americans believe that poverty has worsened since they were children, ever since they saw this picture."
Ask Americans how the world's poverty has evolved, 70% will say that world hunger has worsened since the early 1970s.
"But here is the truth."
Here is the epiphany that changed my way of thinking.
Between the 1970s and today, the percentage of the global population living in famine, living on less than a dollar per day, adjusted for inflation, this percentage has dropped to 80%.
There has been a decrease of 80% in the most severe global poverty since my childhood.
And I didn't even know it.
This, my friends, is a miracle.
We must celebrate it.
This is the greatest anti-poverty success in human history, and it's happening while we're alive.
When I learned this, I asked: what made this possible?
Because if you don't know why, you can't do it again.
If you want to recreate this and escape poverty for the next two billion, because is what we're talking about: since my childhood, two billion of those, our brothers and sisters, have escaped poverty.
I want the next two billion, so I need to know why.
I sought an answer.
"She wasn't political, because I didn't care."
"I don't care always."
"I wanted the best answer from traditional left-wing, right-wing, and center economists."
Here it is.
Here are the reasons.
These are the five reasons why two billion of our brothers and sisters have been lifted out of poverty since my childhood.
The first: globalization.
The second: free trade.
The third: property rights.
The fourth: the rule of law.
The fifth: entrepreneurship.
It was the system of free enterprise spreading worldwide after 1970 that did this.
I am not naive.
I know that free is not perfect and that free alone does not suffice to build a better world.
But she's great.
And it transcends politics.
Here is what I have learned, my epiphany.
Capitalism is is not just a matter of accumulation.
Its main strength lies in aspiration, which is something that many people talk about on this stage, the aspiration that comes from dreams embedded within the system of free enterprise.
We must share it with more people.
I want to tell you about a second epiphany that is connected to the first one and which can lead us to progress, not only in the world but also at home.
The best quote I've heard to summarize the thoughts I've just discussed to get people out of poverty is this: "Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history.
"They have lifted billions of people out of poverty."
Who said that?
It sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
This is false.
The President Barack Obama said it.
Why do I know it by heart?
Because he was speaking to me.
It's crazy.
"And I said: 'Amen!'"
"But, more than that, I said: 'What an opportunity.'"
You know what I was thinking about?
I was at an event organized on this topic at Georgetown University in May 2015.
"And I thought that was was the solution to the biggest problem of America today. What is?"
It's about gathering around these liberal and conservative ideas to help those who need it most.
No need to tell you that we're in crisis, in America and in many politically polarized countries around the world.
It happened at a critical level of crisis.
It's unpleasant. It's not fair.
Last year, there was an article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the Western world.
It was an article from 2014 on the political motivation asymmetry.
What is this? Psychologists call it the phenomenon of assuming that your ideology is based on love but that your opponent's ideology is based on hate.
It's common in a global conflict.
For example, you expect to see it between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the authors of this article have discovered is that today in America, a majority of Republicans and Democrats suffer from political motivation asymmetry.
Today, a majority of politically active people believe they are motivated by love but that the other side is motivated by hate.
Think about it. Think about it.
Most people say: "My ideology is based on fundamental kindness, I want to help people, but the others are demonic and want to do me harm."
The society cannot progress when there is this type of asymmetry.
It's impossible.
How to solve this?
Firstly, let's be honest: there is differences.
Do not underestimate the differences. That would be naive.
There are many studies on this topic.
A veteran of the TED scene is my friend Jonathan Haidt.
He is a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
He works on ideologies, values, and morals of different people to see their differences.
For example, it showed us that conservatives and liberals place different emphasis on what they consider important.
For instance, Jon Haidt showed that liberals care 59% more about poverty than about economic freedom.
And conservatives care 28% more about economic freedom than about poverty.
Irreconcilable differences?
We will never unite. False.
It is diversity that lies our strength.
Remember what got us out of poverty.
It was an obsession with poverty accompanied by the method of spreading economic freedom around the world.
We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people and lift the next two billion out of poverty.
There is no other solution.
How are we going to do it?
It's delicate.
We must innovate in our way of thinking.
Many points are on stage.
Social entrepreneurship. Yes. Absolutely. Phenomenal.
We need to invest abroad in a sustainable, responsible, ethical, and moral way. Yes. Yes.
But what do we really need?
From a flexible ideology,
less predictable.
No?
Have you never felt that your ideology has to be predictable?
Almost conventional?
Do you not feel like you always listen to people who agree with you?
Why is it dangerous?
Because when we talk about economy in this country, on the right, the conservatives, you always talk about taxes, regulations, about a big government.
And on the left, the liberals, you always talk about income inequality.
These are important things, very important to me and to you.
But when it comes to helping those who are dying of hunger and need us, these are distractions.
"We must come together around the best ways to alleviate poverty using the best tools at our disposal. This only happens when conservatives acknowledge needing the liberals and their obsession with poverty, and the liberals needing the conservatives and their obsession with free markets."
It is in this diversity that lies the future strength of this country, if we choose it.
"How are we going to do it? How are we going to do it together?"
"I need an action plan, not just for you but for me."
Number one. First point: it's not enough to tolerate people who don't agree.
It's not enough.
Let us remember that we need people who do not agree, because there are people who need all of us, who are always waiting for these tools.
"What are you going to do? How are you going to express it?"
Where does this start? This starts here.
In this room, we are all lucky.
Lucky to have people who listen to us.
Lucky to prosper. Lucky to lead.
When people hear us, with our unpredictable ideology, they might actually listen to us.
Progress may begin there.
This is the first point. The second.
Secondly: I ask you and myself to be specifically the person who blurs the boundary, who is ambiguous, hard to categorize.
If you are a conservative, be a conservative who always speaks about poverty and the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor.
If you are a liberal, be a liberal who always speaks of the beauty of free markets, using them responsibly, to solve our problems.
If we do this, we get two things.
"One: we start working for the next billions and to be the solution that we have seen in the past and that we need in the future. We get this."
The second thing is that we should be able to take the terrible sacred ideological war we suffer in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
And maybe, maybe, we will realize that our large differences are not actually so large after all.
Thank you.
