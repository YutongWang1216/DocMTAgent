"When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the core of Zimbabwe's national health policy."
"The new government came out of a long war for independence and immediately announced a socialist program: healthcare services, primary education have become essentially free."
"A significant expansion of rural health centers has placed about 80% of the population within two hours' walk of one of these centers, a truly remarkable achievement."
"In 1980, the year of independence, 25% of children in Zimbabwe were fully immunized."
"In 1990, ten years later, this proportion was 80%."
"I felt extremely privileged to be part of this transformation, a revolution."
The excitement, the camaraderie were tangible.
"Working with brilliant Zimbabweans - scientists, doctors, activists - I felt connected not only to an African independence movement, but to a global progressive movement for public health."
"But there were considerable challenges."
Zimbabwe reported its first case of AIDS in 1982, the year of my arrival.
"I had taken care of a few HIV patients in the early 80s during my medical training at Harlem hospital, but - we had no idea what awaited Africa."
My first days there, the infection rate was 2%.
This would have been a sharp increase and reached one in four adults by the time of my departure from Harare, 15 years later.
In the mid-90s, I had announced to hundreds of people in their prime age that they had HIV.
I had seen friends and colleagues, my students, hospital patients die.
In response to this, my colleagues and I set up a clinic.
"We were demonstrating the use of condoms."
"We launched education at school, workplace interventions."
"We were conducting research. We gave advice to the partners of infected men so that they would know how to protect themselves."
"We worked hard, and at the time, I thought I was doing my best."
I provided excellent treatment, as good as possible.
"But I am not speaking of structural change."
The former UN Secretary, Kofi Annan, spoke candidly about his personal failure leading to the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was the director of the peace department at the UN.
At a memorial 10 years later, he said: "At the time, I believed I was doing my best, but I realized after the genocide that I could and should have done more to sound the alarm and gather support."
The AIDS epidemic caught the healthcare community off guard, and today, when the World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people have died from this disease, I am not alone in feeling remorse and regret for not doing more, sooner.
However, when I lived in Zimbabwe, I did not see my role as being that of a defender or a political figure.
I was there due to my technical skills, my clinical expertise, and my epidemiological research.
"For me, my work was to care for the patients and conduct research to better understand the transmission patterns within the population, and I hoped that we would slow down the spread of the virus."
I was aware that marginalized populations had high risks of acquiring and dying from AIDS.
And in sugar plantations, which closely resembled feudal fiefs rather than any modern enterprise, 60% of pregnant women were infected with HIV.
I worked to show that being infected wasn't a moral failure but rather linked to a culture of male superiority, forced labor of immigrants, and colonialism.
The white population was largely unaffected.
As healthcare professionals, our tools were pitifully weak: pleading with people to change their individual behavior, to use condoms, to reduce the number of partners.
The infection rates were rising. And when treatment became available in the West, treatment which remained our most powerful weapon against the virus, it was was not affordable for the African public sector.
I did not denounce the unequal access to these life-saving medications or the underlying economic and political systems that made my country's's infection rates among large segments of the population.
I justified my silence by telling myself that I was just a visitor in this country, that sounding the alarm could make me expelled, prevent me from accomplishing my work, taking care of my patients, performing researches so necessary.
So I did not rebel against the government's initial position on AIDS.
I did not express my concerns aloud.
Many doctors and healthcare professionals may think that I haven't done anything wrong.
Our pact with our patients, the Hippocratic oath and its variations, highlights the inviolability of the doctor-patient relationship.
I did everything I could for each patient I had.
However, I knew that epidemics emerge along the fractures of our society, reflectinging not only our biology, but much more notably the patterns of marginality, exclusion, racial, gender, sexual, class-based discriminations, and so forth.
It was was true for AIDS.
That was true recently for Ebola.
Medical anthropologists like Paul Farmer, who worked on AIDS in Haiti, have termed this 'structural violence'. Structurally, because the inequalities are embedded within the political and economic organization of our social world, and are often invisible to those privileged and in power; and violence, because its impact - premature deaths, suffering, illness - is violent.
"We did little for our patients if we do not acknowledge these social injustices."
Ringing the alarm is the first step towards good public health practice, and it's how we could gather the supports to revolutionize and create a change together.
Today, I no longer remain silent.
I talk about a lot of things, even if they make those who listen uncomfortable, even if they put me in discomfort.
A great deal of what I say is related to racial differences and institutionalized racism, things that are no longer supposed to exist in this country, let alone in medical practice or public health.
"But they do exist and we pay for them by shorteninging lives."
That's why sounding the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the United States, the current institutional and interpersonal violence that people of color face, mixed with our sad legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow, and 60 years of imperfect equality, sounding the alarm about this is fundamental to the successful completion of my role as Commissioner for Health in the city of New York.
In New York, premature mortality - death before reaching turning 65 - is 55% higher for black men than for white men.
In 2012, a black woman had 10 times more risk of dying while giving birth than a white woman.
Despite the significant progress we've made in reducing infant mortality rates, a black baby still has nearly three times the risk of dying during their first year compared to a white baby.
New York is not an exception.
These statistics are compared with statistics made across the United States.
A recent New York Times analysis noted that there was,
1.5 million of missing black men. They mentioned that more than one in six black men who would be between 25 and 54 years old today did not lead a normal life, but was in prison or died prematurely.
There is a great injustice towards the daily and disproportionate violence against young black men, which recent #BlackLivesMatter protests have drawn attention to.
But we must remember that disparate rates that persist and the occurrence and outcomes of common diseases - heart diseases, cancers, diabetes, HIV - diseases that can kill slowly and silently and take even more black lives prematurely.
When the #BlackLivesMatter movement took shape, I was frustrated and angry that the medical community was reluctant to use the word "racism" in our research and work.
You must have felt something every time I said it.
Our students have participated in protests in white coats, but the medical community has largely stayed aloof while current discrimination continues to shape disease patterns and mortality.
And I fear that the trend towards personalized and precise medicine, seeking biological or genetic targets for more tailored treatments, could inadvertently make us lose sight of the overall picture, that is, the daily context in a person lives, grows, works, loves, a fundamental factor in determining population health: for too many of us, poor health.
As healthcare professionals, in our daily work, whether in practice or research, we witness a great injustice: the homeless who are unable to follow medical advice due to other priorities; the transgender youth considering suicide because society is too rigid; the single mother made to feel responsible for her child's poor health.
Our role as healthcare professionals is not only to treat our patients but to sound the alarm and promote change.
Whether right or wrong, our position in society makes us very credible, and we should not waste this.
I regret not speaking up in Zimbabwe, and I have vowed that as Commissioner for Health in the city of New York, I will utilize every opportunity to sound the alarm and secure support for health equity.
I will denounce racism, and I hope you will join me, and I will join you in denouncing sexism or any other form of inequality.
It is time to rise and, as a community, to denounce the structural inequalities.
We don't need all the answers to call for change.
We only need courage.
The health of our patients, of each one of us, depends on it.
