"When I was young, I dreamed of the ocean."
"A wild place, very colorful and full of life, hosting strange and fantastic creatures."
"I imagined great sharks ruling as masters and graceful sea turtles swirling through the corals."
"First as a marine biologist, then photographer, I spent most of my career looking for places just as magical as those I dreamed of when I was young."
"As you can see, I started very early to explore the water."
"But the first time I really went underwater, I was around 10 years old."
"I remember vividly striking with my flippers determinedly to reach this old cannon embedded in a shallow coral reef."
"When I finally managed to catch it, I raised my eyes and found myself surrounded by fish of all rainbow colors."
"OnThat day, I fell in love with the ocean."
"Thomas Peschak Photographer specializing in marine conservation Over the course of 40 years on Earth, I have had the immense privilege of exploring some of the most extraordinary marine landscapes for National Geographic and for the Save Our Seas foundation."
"I've photographed everything, from giant sharks to tiny ones that can fit in the palm of your hand."
"I felt the fish in the breath of the humpback whales feeding beside me in the cold waters off Canada, near the Great Bear Rainforest."
"I've even known all about the romantic rituals of the green turtle in the Mozambique Channel."
"We all leave a mark on the ocean and vice versa."
"And the beautiful, pristine ones I dreamed of as a child are still harder to find."
"They are always smaller and more threatened."
"As humans continue to play the role of the planet's largest predator, I have witnessed direct consequences and documented them through my photography."
"I used to believe that I needed to shock my audience with disturbing images to jolt them out of their indifference."
"ThisThis approach has its merits, but I've come back to it."
According to me, the best way to create change is by selling love.
"If one wishes, I am a matchmaker, and as a photographer, I have the exceptional opportunity to reveal entire animals and ecosystems hidden beneath the ocean's surface."
"YouOne cannot love and fight for something if one ignores its existence."
"Revealinging this - that's the power of marine photography."
Among the hundreds of underwater locations I've visited, a few of these landscapes have deeply affected me.
I saw the first of these landscapes about 10 years ago off the rugged and cliff-lined coast of South Africa.
Every summer, enormous schools of sardines migrate north, a phenomenon of mass movement called the Sardine Run.
A crazy rush of these fish
Where heries of hungry and nimble predators chase them.
Common dolphins hunt together and manage to isolate sardines from the main school, creating small schools.
They dive and trap the fish upwards, against the surface, rushing to enjoy their shimmering feast.
The sharks follow closely.
For many people, sharks and dolphins are sworn enemies, but during the Sardine Run, they coexist.
In fact, the dolphins help the sharks feed more efficiently.
Without the dolphins, the small schools created are sparser and the sharks often end up with a "sardine doughnut " or a bite of water.
I had some lively moments with the sharks during the Sardine Run, but I know they they don't see me as prey.
I receive hits and am pushed around like all the other participants in this chaotic feast.
Leaving the African coast, head towards the east, across the vastness of the Indian Ocean until the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands.
During the monsoon season, all the mantas in the archipelago migrate to a tiny island in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.
Armies of crustaceans, most smaller than a ball, are the basic food of the manta rays.
When plankton concentrations are low, the manta rays feed alone and they perform backward loops, in a cycle, like a puppy chasing its tail.
When the density of plankton increases, the rays align themselves head to tail and form these long chains. Each delicious bite that eludes the first is swallowed by the second or the next one.
When the concentration of plankton reaches its peak, the manta rays swim closer together in a rotating movement through which they feed.
As they swirl in this tight formation, the column of manta rays creates its own vortex, drawingling and bringing plankton right into the cavernous mouths of the rays.
The experience of diving among these countless rays is absolutely unforgettable.
The first time I photographed Hanifaru, the site was unprotected and threatened by development.
I have worked with organizations like the Manta Trust, and my photographs have helped turn Hanifaru into a protected marine area.
Local fishermen from nearby islands hunted these mantas, usinging their skin to make traditional drums.
Today, they are the most dedicated conservationists, and manta rays contribute over of 8 million dollars annually to the Maldives economy.
I always wanted to travel back in time and see an era where maps were incomplete or indicated: "Here be dragons".
I came closest to it by visiting these remote atolls in the heart of the Indian Ocean.
Distantly, very distant, beyond the lines of the boats and fishing, diving into these waters is a poignant reminder of what our oceans once looked like.
Bassas da India is greatly underrecognized. It's a tiny coral patch in the Mozambique Channel.
His barrier forms a shield that protects his inner lagoon, a nursery for the Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are far from timid, even during the day.
Something told me they'd be even bolder and more numerous at night.
I found myself facing more sharks than ever before, gathered on a mere outcrop.
Photographer and sharing moments like these remind me why I chose this path.
Recently, I was working on a project in Baja California for National Geographic.
Halfway down, as you descend along the Pacific coast, lies San Ignacio Lagoon, where the gray whale comes to give birth there.
For a century, this coast was the stage of a systematic slaughter, over 20 000 gray whales were killed there, leaving only a few hundreds to survive.
Today, the descendants of these same whales play on the surface with their offspring and they even interact with us.
This species has remarkably recovered.
On the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo, a sleepy fishing village.
Decades of overfishing have brought them to the brink of collapse.
In 1995, local fishermen convinced authorities to make their waters a marine reserve.
But what happened afterwards is a miracle.
In 2005, after only a decade of protection, scientists registered the largest increase in fish population.
But don't take my word for it, come with me.
In a breath, swim with me deep down amidst one of the largest and most dense schools of fish I have ever encountered.
We all have the ability to spark hope.
And through my photographs, I want to convey the message that it's not too late for our oceans.
And I would particularly like to highlight the resilience of nature in the face of 3.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I must diligently seek out opportunities to take photos like this, always creating images that showcase our respectful coexistence with the ocean that.
I hope, it will become my daily routine.
To thrive and survive in doing my job, one really needs to be an unshakable optimist.
I always work with the belief that the next amazing image that will serve my purpose is just around the corner, right behind the next reef, at the heart of the next lagoon, or who one knows, maybe even the one after that.
