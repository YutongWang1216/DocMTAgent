This is a story about how we know what we know.
This is a story about this woman Natalia Rybczynski.
She is a paleobiologist, which means she specializes in excavating old dead things.
Natalia Rybczynski: Yes, sometimes, they called me "Dr Dead Things".
Latif Asseer: I think she's interesting because of where she works, way above the Arctic Circle in the isolated tundra of Canada.
One summer day in 2006, she was at a dig site called Fyles Leaf Bed, which is less than 10 degrees of latitude north of the magnetic pole.
Natalia Rybczynski: Frankly, it doesn't seem exciting, because it was just a day of walking with a backpack, a GPS, and a notebook, and we were collecting everything that could be a fossil.
Latif Asseer: And at some point, she noticed something.
Frankly, it's rusty, red-brown in color, big like the size of my hand.
It was just laid on the ground.
And at first, she thought it was just a splinter, like those found at the Fyles Leaf Bed previously - pieces of prehistoric plants.
But that evening, back at the camp, ...
Frankly, I take out a magnifying glass, I look at it more closely and I realize that it doesn't have the growth rings of a tree.
Maybe it's its preservation, but it really looks like...
a bone.
And so, during the four years that followed, she returned to this place on many occasions, and in the end she collected 30 fragments of the same bone, most of them quite small.
Frankly, it's not that. It fits into a small plastic bag.
And she tried to assemble them like a puzzle.
But it was stimulating.
Frankly, it's all broken into so many small pieces, I try with sand and adhesive, but to no avail.
So finally, we used a 3D surface scanner.
Lisa: Oh! Natalia: Yes, exactly.
But it was was more straightforward to do it virtually.
Natalia: It's a bit magical when everything comes together.
Lisa: How did you know it was good, that they were put together correctly?
Was it possible to assemble them differently to get a parrot or something else?
Frankly, no. No, it couldn't only be that.
Lisa: She found out that what she had was a tibia, a leg bone, and specifically, the bone of a hoofed mammal with cloven hooves, so something like a cow or a sheep.
But it couldn't have been one of those.
It was just too big.
Natalia: The size of this thing was enormous. It's a very large animal.
Lisa: So, what kind of animal could it be?
At the end, she showed one of the fragments to her colleagues in Colorado, and they had an idea.
Natalia: We took a saw and just made a cut along the edge, and there was this very interesting smell that came off of it.
Lisa: It smelled like burnt flesh.
It was an odor that Natalia recognized after butch cutting many skulls in her disgusting anatomy lab: collagen.
The collagen is what gives our bones their structure.
And generally, after so many years, it decomposes.
"But in this case, the Arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it."
Then, a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol, and she saw that one of her colleagues, Mike Buckley, was presenting a new method called "the collagen imprint".
It turns out that all species have slightly different collagen structures, so if you have the profile of the collagen from an unknown bone, you can compare it to that of known species, and who knows, maybe they matches.
So she sent him one of the fragments via FedEx.
Natalia: Yes, we wanted to follow it. It was quite significant.
LN: He studied it, and compared it to 3 known modern mammalian species.
And he found found a match.
It turns out that the 3.5 million year old bone that Natalia excavatede from the high Arctic belonged to...
an animal.
NR: And I was thought: "It's great -- if it's true."
LN: They tested several fragments and got the same result each time.
However, based on the size of the bone they had found found, this camel appeared to be 30% larger than modern camels.
So this camel would have been nearly 2.8 meters tall, and weighed close to a ton.
"And yes."
Natalia had found a giant arctic camel.
Alright, when you hear the word "camel," what should come to mind is this type of camel, the Bactriane camel from Eastern and Central Asia.
"But it's possible that you're thinking of a postcard image, like this one, the dromedary, the typical desert animal - which lives in the scorching sands of places like the Middle East or the Sahara, with a big hump on its back where it stores water for its camel rides, and with large, broad feet that help it climb sand dunes."
So, how can one of them end up in the Extreme Arctic?
Actually, scientists had known for a long time, even before Natalia's discovery, that originally camels are American.
They started here.
During the 45 million years since camels existed, they could be found found in North America, approximately 20 different species, possibly more.
If we aligned them all, would we see differences?
NR: Yes, the bodies will have different sizes.
You're going to end up with very long necks, which will actually be like giraffes.
LN: Some had mouths, like crocodiles.
NR: The most primitive ones would have been very small, almost like rabbits.
LN: What? Camels as big as rabbits?
NR: The oldest.
So probably you wouldn't recognize them.
LN: Good heavens, I want a rabbit-camel.
NR: I know, it would be great.
LN: And three to seven million years ago, a branch of camels descended into South America, where they became llamas and alpacas, and another branch crossed the Bering land bridge into Asia and Africa.
And at the end of the last glacial period, the American camels became extinct.
So scientists already knew all of this, but it doesn't really explain why Natalia found such a giant bone so far up north.
Because, in terms of temperature, it's exactly the opposite of the Sahara.
To be honest, 3.5 million ago, the average temperature was 22Â°C warmer than today.
So there would have been a boreal forest, more like the Yukon or Siberia of today.
"But still, they would have had winters that lasted 6 months during which the ponds were frozen."
There would have been blizzards.
There would have been days that lasted 24 hours completely immersed in darkness.
So, how... How?
How is is possible that one of these stars from the Sahara could survive in this arctic environment?
Natalia and her colleagues think they have an answer.
And it's pretty great.
And if the characteristics that made the camel so well adapted to places like the Sahara had actually evolved to help it withstand the winter?
And if these wide feet were made, not for walking on sand, but in snow, like a pair of snowshoes?
And if this hump - which, by the way, big news for me, contains not water but fat - was there to help the camel withstand these six-month winters, when food is scarce?
And then, only later, after crossing the land bridge, he used these features to adapt them to the scorching deserts.
For example, the bump can be useful for camels in desert climates because having all their fat in one place, like a backpack of fat, means they don't have that insulating layer on the rest of their body.
So heat dissipates more easily.
This is the crazy idea that the attributes of the camel that prove, according to us, its desert nature might actually be the proof of its past in in the Arctic.
So, I'm not the first to tell this story.
Some have spoken about it to embellish the biology of evolution or to give an insight on the future of climate change.
"But I love it for another reason."
For me, it's a story about us, about how we see the world and how that changes.
I have a history degree.
And I've learned that many scientists are actually also historians.
They give meaning to the past.
They tell the story of our universe, our planet, and life on it.
And as a historian, we start with a certain idea of how history unfolds.
NR: We make stories and that's all, like the camel in the desert.
It's a great story! It fits well with the idea.
They apparently always lived there.
LN: But at any moment, we can discover a tiny little piece of evidence.
We can learn something small that will force us to rethink everything we thought we knew.
For instance, in this case, there's a scientist who finds this fragment thinking it to be a piece of wood, and due to this, science has a completely new and truly counterintuitive theory explaining why this creature, seeming to come out of Dr. Seuss's drawings, is as it is.
And for me, it completely changed the way I see the camel.
He went from being this ridiculous creature only adapted to a specific environment, to this great traveler just arrived in the Sahara, and who who could theoretically go anywhere.
Here is Azuri.
Azuri, hello, how are you?
Alright, here it is for you.
Azuri is on vacation, usually he is at his concerts at the Radio City Music Hall.
It's not even a joke.
Briefly -- Azuri is here as a living proof, to remind us that the story of our world is dynamic.
Only our will can help us adjust and reinvent it.
Is this not, Azuri?
And really, we are all at the tip of a bone to see the world differently.
Thank you very much.
