Hello.
My name is Matthew Williams, and I am a champion.
I have won medals in three different sports, national championships in Canada, played at an international level in basketball, and was proud to represent Canada on the global stage.
I train 5 days a week in basketball and speed skating, work with top-quality coaches and performance mental consultants to be the best in my sport.
Furthermore, I do all of this with the Special Olympic Games.
Does this change the way you perceive my person and my successes?
The world doesn't't see people like me as champions.
Not too long ago, people like me were shunned and hidden.
The Special Olympic Games have evolved a lot since their inception in 1968, but the intellectual disabled are often invisible to the general public.
People use the word 'R' with me, and they think it's not a big deal.
This is the offensive use of the words "delayed" or "behind".
They can't imagine how much this hurts us, me and my friends.
I don't want you to think that I'm here for charity.
I am here because there is always a significant issue with how many people perceive individuals with intellectual disabilities, or, too often, how they do not see them at all.
Did you know that the world championships took place this year?
I was among the over 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities coming from 165 countries competing in Los Angeles.
There were over 62,000 spectators at the opening ceremonies, and Tsn and espn were covering the event.
Did you know that this event took place?
What do you think when you meet someone like me?
I am here today to challenge you to consider us as equals.
The Special Olympic Games transform the identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perception of anyone watching the competition.
For those of you who may not know, the Special Olympic Games are aimed at athletes with intellectual disabilities.
The Special Olympic Games are separate from the Paralympic and Olympic Games.
We offer high-quality sporting programs all year round for people with intellectual disabilities, which changes lives and perceptions.
This movement has changed my life and that of so many others.
And it has changed how the world sees people with intellectual disabilities.
I was born with epilepsy and intellectual disability.
Growing up, I played hockey until I was 12 years old.
The longer I grew, the more I felt it was harder to keep up with others, and I was irritated and frustrated.
For a while, I didn't practice any sports, had no friends, and felt forgotten and sad.
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden from society.
No one thought they they could practice a sport, and even less be an important member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, studied the effects of regular exercise on the physical condition of children with intellectual disabilities.
Using rigorous scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers concluded that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that led to physical condition issues.
Many people doubted that people with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sporting competitions.
But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of the Special Olympic Games, persisted, and the athletes of the Special Olympic Games proved them right half a million times.
Before joining the Special Olympic Games, I was nervous because I was young, shy, and had little confidence in myself and I had not many friends.
When I arrived, however, everyone greatly encouraged me, supported me, and allowed me to be myself without being judged.
Now, I am a basketball player and a speed skater who competed in regional, national events, and this year finished at the Summer World Championships in Los Angeles, where I was part of the first ever Canadian basketball team to participate in the World Championships.
I am one of the over four and a half million athletes worldwide, and I have heard so many similar stories.
Being a Special Olympic Games athlete restores pride and dignity.
The Special Olympic Games also address significantable health needs.
Studies have shown that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities age 13 years younger than those without, and women with intellectual disabilities age 20 years younger than those without.
The Special Olympic Games keep us healthy, make us active, and involve us in sports.
Furthermore, our coaches teach us about nutrition and health.
The Special Olympic Games also provide free screening tests for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor or accessing medical care.
At the 2015 Summer World Championships, my Canadian teammates and I played against the Nigerian team.
The day before our game, the Nigerian basketball team had come for the screening of World Championship athletes. Free distribution was given to seven members on the 5th and they had the chance to hear clearly for the first time.
This change for them was was incredible.
They were very excited, happy, and confident, as their coaches could communicate orally with them.
And they were very moved because they could hear the sounds of the basketball, the whistle sounds, and the enthusiastic fans in the stands - sounds that we take for granted.
The Special Olympic Games do more than transform athletes in sports.
The Special Olympic Games transform their lives off the fields.
This year, a study showed that almost half of the adults in the US do not know a single person with an intellectual disability, and the 44% of Americans who do not have personal contact with intellectual disabilities are significantly less tolerant and positive.
And then there's the word "R" in "RE ", showing that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people.
People use it as a regular term or an insult.
It was tweeted over nine million times last year, and it deeply hurts me and my four and a half million million fellow athletes around the world.
People don't't imagine it's insulting, but it is.
As my fellow athlete and global spokesperson, John Franklin Stephens, wrote in an open letter to a political commentator who had used the word "retard" as an insult, "Come join us one day at the Special Olympic Games."
"YouSee if you return back with an unchanged heart."
This year, at the 2015 Summer World Championships, people lined up for hours before diving into the final night of weightlifting competition.
This evening was filled to capacity when my teammate Jackie Barrett, the Spirit of Newfoundland, lifted 297 kg and 277 kg in squats - setting enormous new records at the Special Olympic Games.
Jackie is one of the record holders among all weightliftersersers in Newfoundland - not only at the Special Olympic Games but all weightliftersersers.
Jackie was a huge celebrity in Los Angeles, and ESPN tweeted live as he set his new record and was impressed by his performance.
F5 years ago, few people imagined that intellectually disabled individuals could do something like this.
This year, 6,500 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of the World Championships and cheer for the athletes from 165 countries around the world.
Far from being hidden, we were applauded and celebrated.
The Special Olympic Games teach athletes to be confident and proud of themselves.
The Special Olympic Games teach the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and consideration.
Now, I have dreams and successes in my sport, amazing coaches, respect and dignity, better health, and I'm pursuing a career as a personal trainer.
I am no longer hidden, mocked, and here I am giving a TED talk.
The world is a different place thanks to the Special Olympic Games, but there is still work to be done.
So next time you see someone with intellectual disabilities, I hope you see their talent.
The next time someone uses the word "R" near you, I hope you will tell them how much it is hurts.
I hope you will consider getting involved in the Special Olympic Games.
I would like to leave with one final thought.
Nelson Mandela said: "Sport has the power to change the world."
The Special Olympic Games change the world by transforming four million and a half million million of athletes, giving us a place to have confidence, meet friends, not be judged, and feel and be champions.
Thank you very much.
