"At university, I specialized in Political Sciences so I had to write many dissertations."
"When a regular student writes a dissertation, they kind of spreads out the work like this."
"Youknow... You might start slowly, but but you write a bit during the first week and paired with more productive days, in the end, everything is done and everyone keeps their calm."
"And I would like to do it like this."
"That would be the goal. Everything would be prepared. But the dissertation comes and then, I do this."
"And that's how it is for every dissertation."
"Then came my final year thesis of 90 pages, a document on which you are supposed to work for a year."
"I knew that for such a dissertation, my usual rhythm wasn't viable."
"So I planned everything, and I decided that I had to aim for something like this."
"The year was going to unfold like this."
"So I was going to start light, and I was going to increase in the middle of the months, and at the end, I was going to put the top speed, like a little staircase."
"Going up stairs, where is the difficulty."
"It's not much, is it?"
"But then, something funny happened."
"Those first months?"
"They arrived and went by, and I couldn't really work."
"So we have a great revised plan."
"And then... But then, those middle months arrived and I didn't really write a word, so we were here."
"Then, two months turn into one month, which turns into two weeks."
"And one day, I woke up with three days before the deadline, having not written a single word yet. So I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours, with not one, but two sleepless nights. Humans are not made for two sleepless nights. I ran across the campus, dove into it headfirst, and submitted the dissertation just before the deadline."
"I thought it was the end of all of this."
"But a week later, I received a call from the university."
"And they say: 'Tim Urban?'"
"And I replied: 'Yes.' "
"We need to talk about your thesis."
"Alright."
"And they say: 'This is the best one we have ever seen.'"
"It's not true."
"It was was a very, very bad thesis."
"I just wanted to cherish this unique moment when you all thought: 'This guy is fantastic!'"
"No, it is very, very bad."
Today, I write a blog.
I write the blog Wait But Why.
A few years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.
My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me. I wanted to explain to the world what goes on in our head, why we are like this.
I had a hypothesis that the brain of procrastinators is actually different from the brain of other people.
"To test this, I found a lab with MRI that allowed me to scan my brain and that of a confirmed non-procrastinator, so I could compare them."
"I brought them here to show them to you today."
"I want you to look closely to identify a difference."
"I know that if you're not brain experts, this might not be as straightforward, but try anyway."
So here is the brain of a non-procrastinator.
"Now...
Here is my brain.
There is a difference.
Both brains have a Rational Decider in them, but the procrastinator's's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.
What does this mean for the procrastinator?
This means that everything is fine until this happens.
So the Rational Decider will make the rational decision to do something productive. But the Monkey doesn't't like this plan, so it takes the wheel and says: "Actually, let's read the whole Wikipedia page on the Nancy Kerrigan/Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered this. "
"So... So we're going to the fridge to see if there's anything new since the last 10 minutes."
After that, we get caught in a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman on magnets and ends much, much later with interviews of Justin Bieber's mother.
"All of this is going to take time so we won't have the time to work today. Sorry!"
"What is happening here?"
The Monkey doesn't seem like someone you want at the wheel.
He lives entirely in the present moment.
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he is interested in only two things: ease and amusement.
In the animal world, it works correctly.
If you're a dog and you spend your life doing only easy and fun things, you're fantastic!
For the Monkey, humans are just another animal species.
You need to sleep, eat, and create a new generation. This could work in prehistory.
"But if you haven't noticed, we don't live in prehistory."
"We live in an advanced civilization and the Monkey doesn't know what that is."
That's why we have another person in our brain, the Rational Decider, which gives us the ability to do things that no other animal can do.
One can project into the future.
"We can have an overview of the situation."
One can make long-term projects.
"And he wants to take all of this into account."
"And he wants us to just do what makes sense, here and now."
Sometimes it's logical to do easy and fun things, like when you eat or go to bed or enjoy well-deserved free time.
There is overlap. Sometimes they are in agreement.
"But there are other times when it's much more logical to do harder and less pleasant things, for the sake of the overall situation."
A conflict is then created.
For the procrastinator, this conflict tends to end in the same way each time, leaving them spending a lot of time in this orange zone, a comfortable and fun place, completely out of the Logic Circle.
I call it the Dark Playground.
The Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators know very well.
This is where one has leisure activities at times when they shouldn't be happening.
The enjoyment you have on the Dark Playground is actually not enjoyable, because it is unwarranted and the air is filled with guilt, fear, anxiety, self-loathing, all these feelings of a good procrastinator.
In this situation, with the Monkey at the wheel, the question is: how can the procrastinator have arrived here in the gray area, a less pleasant place, but one where truly important things happen?
It turns out that the procrastinator has a guardian angel. Someone who always watches over him during his anxious moments. Someone called the Panic Monster.
The Panic Monster sleeps most of the time but wakes up abruptly every time a deadline approaches too closely or there's a risk of public embarrassment, a career disaster, or any other terrible consequence.
And the most important thing, it's the only thing the Monkey is afraid of.
It became very relevant in my life recently, when people from TED contacted me six months ago and invited me to give a presentation.
Of course, I said yes.
It has always been my dream to have given a presentation for TED.
But in the midst of this excitement, the Rational Decider seemed to have something else on its mind.
He said: "Do you understand fully what you have accepted?"
Do you understand what is going to happen now?
"We must sit down and work on this now."
And the Monkey said: "Agreed, let's open Google Earth and look at the southern part of India, about 55 meters above the ground, and scroll the map for 2 to 3 hours, until we reach the northern part of the country, to better understand India."
That's what we did that day.
As the six months turned into four, then two, and finally one month, the TED people decided to publish the names of the speakers.
I opened the website and saw my face looking back at me.
And guess who woke up?
The Panic Monster starts to lose its mind, and a few seconds later, chaos reigns throughout the system.
And the Monkey, remember yourselves, is terrified by the Boom Panic Monster, there it is at the top of the tree!
And finally, the Rational Decider can take the wheel and I can start working on the presentation.
The Panic Monster explains much of the rather unsensible behavior of procrastinators, like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start a sentence of a dissertation and miraculously find the incredible work ethic to stay awake all night to write 8 pages.
This entire situation, with these three characters, is the system of the procrastinator.
It's not pretty, but at the end, it works.
This is what I decided to write about on the blog a few years ago.
When I did it, I was surprised by the responses.
Thousands of emails have arrived, from all around the world, from all sorts of people, doing all sorts of things.
There were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and many, many PhD students.
They were all writing to say the same thing: "I also have this problem."
But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the article and the heavy tone of these emails.
These people wrote with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives, about what the Monkey had made them do.
I thought about it and said: if the procrastinator's system works, where's the problem?
Why do these people feel so bad?
Apparently, there are two types of procrastinations.
The examples I gave today all have a deadline.
If there is a deadline, the effects of procrastination are contained in the short term due to the involvement of the Panic Monster.
However, there is a second type that arrives in situations without deadlines.
If you want a career as an independent, in arts or entrepreneurship, at the beginning, there's no deadline to these things because nothing happens before you start doing the hard work to gain momentum for things to move forward. Plenty of important things.
Beyond your career where there are no deadlines, like your family, your health, exercising, working on your romantic relationship or leaving when it's not working.
If the only mechanism the procrastinator uses to tackle difficult tasks is the Panic Monster, this is a problem because in all these situations without deadlines, he's not there, he has no reason to awaken. The effects of procrastination are not contained and spread infinitely.
This is the long-term type of procrastination that is much less visible and talked about than the more amusing, short-term one based on deadlines.
We often suffer in silence and in private.
It can be the source of a huge amount of pain and regret.
That was why these people were sending me these emails and that's why they felt so bad.
It's not that they they were working on certain projects.
Long-term procrastination has sometimes been like spectators in their own life.
The frustration isn't that they they cannot realize their dreams, it's that they they cannot even make the first step.
So I read these emails and had some sort of epiphany: I don't think non-procrastinators exist.
It's true. I think you're all procrastinators.
Perhaps not all of you are in as dire straits as some of us... and some here might have a healthy relationship with deadlines. But remember: the greatest trick the Monkey has is when there are no deadlines.
I want to show you one last thing.
I call this the Life Calendar.
AEnglish translation> A box for each week for a life of 93 years.
This doesn't amount to many boxes, especially when we've already used quite a few.
I think we should all look closely at this calendar.
We must reflect on the subjects on which we procrastinate because everyone procrastinates on something in their life.
We must remain aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey.
It's a task for each of us.
There aren't not many boxes so it's a job that should probably start today.
Actually, maybe not today...
You know...
Soon.
Thank you.
