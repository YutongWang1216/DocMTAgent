"We were were, souls and bodies piled up in a Texas church, during our last night of life."
"Stacked in a room like this one, but with old wooden benches draped in a worn red fabric, an organ to my left and a choir behind me, the baptismal fonts inset in the wall behind this one."
"A room like this one, nonetheless."
"With this same incredible sense of suspense, the same deep hopes for salvation, the same sweat on the palms, and the same people at the back not listening."
"We were on December 31, 1999, the night of Christ's's second coming, and the end of the world as I knew it."
"I had been 12 that year, and I had reached the age of responsibility."
"After I stopped complaining about the injustice of Jesus' return when I was was supposed to be held responsible for my actions, I realized it was better that I should get started quickly."
"I went to church as often as possible."
"I was waiting for silence with the anxiety of someone who would wait for noise, trying to make sure that the Lord had not played a trick on me and had decided to come back sooner."
"And in case He returned sooner, I had anticipated a survival plan, by reading the series of 'Left Behind' which were a hit at the time."
"I found in their pages that if I wasn't not taken at midnight, I had another chance."
"I just needed to avoid marking the beast's, fighting the demons, plagues, and even Antichrist himself."
"It would be difficult - but I knew I was capable."
"But it was no longer the time to organize."
"It was 11:50 pm."
"There were 10 minutes left, and my pastor called us to the altar, because he wanted to pray when midnight struck."
"Each faction of the congregation took its place."
"The choir remained in the choir loft, the deacons and their wives - or the Baptist Bourgeoisie, as I like to call them - took their place at the front row facing the altar."
"See, in the US, even the Second Coming of Christ has a VIP section."
"And just behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie were the elderly - these men and women whose backs had once bentled under the hot sun of the Texas East cotton fields, whose skins seemed marked with a smooth and noble brown, much like the clay of East Texas, whose hopes and dreams for their lives outside of East Texas East had sometimes been shattered,"
"Deeper than their backs."
"Yes, these men and these women were for me the stars of the show."
"They had waited for this moment all their lives, like their medieval predecessors had waited for the end of the world with eagerness, and like my grandmother awaited the Oprah Winfrey Show on Channel 8 every day at 4pm."
"And as she headed towards the altar, I hid behind her, for I was absolutely sure that my grandmother would go to Heaven."
"And I thought that if I held onto her hand tightly during the prayer, it was possible that I could go with her."
I therefore held her hand, and closed my eyes, to listen, to wait.
The prayers became stronger.
And the cries in response to the call to prayer rose even higher.
The organ joined the funeral atmosphere.
And the budding heat joined the sweat.
My hand strengthened its grip, not to be the one left behind.
I closed my eyes tighter, not wanting to see the separation of the good grain from the chaff.
Then a voice rose above us: "Amen."
"It was over."
"I looked at the clock."
"It was past midnight."
"I watched the older believers, whose savior had not come, who were too proud to show their disappointment, who had believed too much and for too long to start doubting now."
"But I was upset for them."
"They had been deceived, tricked, manipulated, and I had let myself be taken in with them."
"I had said their prayers, I hadn't not given in to the temptation as best I could."
"I had not dipped my head once, but twice, into these baptismal fonts which gave the measles."
"I had believed."
"And now what?"
I arrived home in time to turn on the TV and watch Peter Jennings announce the new millennium, as he traveled around the world.
I was struck by the peculiarity of the multiple returns of Jesus, based on different time zones.
And I felt even more ridiculous - hurt, really.
"But that night, I didn't stop believing."
"I just started to believe in something new: that it was possible not to believe."
"It was possible that the answers be false, that the questions themselves be false."
"Nowhere, where there had been a mountain of certainty, there was a rush towards its base, a source of doubt, a source promising rivers."
I can trace the root of the tragedy throughout my life, that night, in that church, when my Saviour didn not come for me; when what I truly believed turned out, not to be a lie, but at least, not fully the truth.
Although some may have prepared for the year 2000 in a very different way, I am convinced that you are here because part of you has done the same thing as me from the beginning of this new century, since my mother left, my father didn't return, and my Lord refused to come.
And I stretched out my hand in order to reach to something to believe in.
I held on, when I arrived at Yale at 18 years old, believing that my journey from Oak Cliff, Texas, was a chance to leave behind all the trials I had experienced, the dreams and broken bodies I had seen.
But when I found found myself at home during winter holidays, face on the ground, hands tied behind my back, and a robber's pistol on my head, I knew that even the best education could not save me.
I held on when I arrived at Lehman Brothers as an intern in 2008.
With so much hope - that I called my family to inform them that we would never be poor again.
"But when I saw this temple of finance crumble before my eyes, I knew that even the best job couldn't save me."
I held on when I arrived at Washington, as a young employee, who had heard a voice come from Illinois, saying: "We have waited for a long time, but with this election, change has arrived in the United States."
"But when Congress stood still, when the country tore apart, when hope and change rang like a joke, I realized that even a political second coming couldn't save me."
"I had faithfully knelt at the altar of the American Dream, praying to the gods of my era, gods of success, money, and power."
"But still and yet, midnight sounded, and I opened my eyes to see the death of all these gods."
From this cemetery, I began to search again, not out of courage, but because I knew that either I believed, or I died.
So I embarked on a pilgrimage, once more towards another Mecca, Harvard Business School - knowing this time that I could not simply accept the salvation she claimed to offer.
No, I knew there would be more work to do.
The work started late, in a dark corner of a crowded party, on the miserable and early winter night of Cambridge, when three friends and I wondered what young people seeking authenticity have been wondering for a long time: "And what if we hit the road?"
We didn't know where to go or how to get there, but we knew that we had to do it.
"All our lives, we yearned, as Jack Kerouac wrote, to 'slip into the night and disappear somewhere', and go see what everyone was doing all over the country."
Although other voices said that the risk was too high and the evidence too thin, we still went went.
In the summer of 2013, we traveled nearly 13,000 km across America, through the pastures of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit, through the swamps of New Orleans, where we found found men and women creating small businesses whose purpose defined the goals.
Having been formed at the extreme end of capitalism, this seemed to us like a revolutionary idea.
And this idea spread, growing into a non-profit organization, MBAs Across America, a movement that brought me to this stage, here today.
This idea grew as we realized that our generation craves purpose, meaning.
because we found countless entrepreneurs in all corners of America, who created jobs, changed lives, and who needed a little help.
But if I'm honest, it has also grown because I have fought for it.
I spared no effort in preaching this gospel, in enticing more people to believe that we could heal the wounds of a shattered country, one social enterprise at a time.
But it was the gospel journey that led me towards this somewhat different gospel that I came to share with you today.
This journey started one evening, almost a year ago, at the Natural History Museum in New York, during a gala for the alumni of the Harvard Business School.
Under a life-size whale replica, I sat with the titans of our era, as they celebrated their peers and good deeds.
There was was pride in a room where the value and net assets under management exceeded 500 billion dollars.
We examined everything we had done, and it was all right.
"But fate decided that, two days later, I had to go not too far from there, to Harlem. I found myself sitting in an urban farm that used to be a vacant lot, listening to a man named Tony talk about the children who came here every day."
They all lived below the poverty line.
Many of them carried their belongings in a backpack to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter.
Some of them were participating in Tony's program, called Harlem Grown, in order to get their only meal of the day.
Tony told me he had launched Harlem Grown with his retirement money, after 20 years being as a taxi driver.
He told me he didn't pay himself, because, despite his success, the program struggled to obtain resources.
He told me he would accept any help he could receive.
And I was there to help.
When I left Tony, I felt the burn and the salt of the tears rising in my eyes.
I felt the weight of the revelation that one evening I could sit in in a room where a few hundred people had $500 billion dollars and in another room, two days later, barely 5 kilometers away, where a man lived without salary so that a child could have his only meal of the day.
It wasn't not the glaring inequality that made me want to cry. It wasn't not the thought of these hungry children, without a home, it wasn't not the anger towards the 1% or the pity towards the 99%.
No, I was perturbed because I had finally realized that I was the dialysis of a country that needed a kidney transplant.
I realized that my story replaced all those of those we expected would take their own hands, even if they had nothing to grip for taking their own hands; that my body replaced all the structural, systemic aid that never went to Harlem, or the Appalachians, or basement 9, that my voice replaced all these voices that seemed too ignorant, too proletarian, too ill-fitted.
And this shame, this shame overwhelmed me, like the shame of sitting in front of the television watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium, again, and again, and again.
I had been deceived, tricked, manipulated.
But this time, the false Savior, it was me.
You see, I've come a long way from the altar, that night when I thought the world was going to end, from a world where people spoke different languages, considered suffering as a necessary act of God, and took a text as an unassailable truth.
Yes, I've come such a long way that I find myself exactly where I started.
Because it's simply false to say that we live in an era of disbelief - no, we believe today just as much as before.
Some of us may believe in the prophecy of Brené Brown or Tony Robbins.
"We can believe in the Bible of New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review."
We can deeply believe when we worship here, at the TED church, yet we desperately want to believe, we need to believe.
We speak the language of charismatic leaders who promise to solve all our problems.
We see suffering as a necessary act of capitalism, our god. We take the text of technological progress as being infallible truth.
And we barely realize the human cost we pay when we fail to question a single brick, fearing it might destroy all our foundations.
"But if you are disturbed by the unacceptable things we have come to accept, then it must be time for a rethink."
I don't have a gospel of disruption or innovation, or a triple line line of results.
In fact, I don't have a gospel of faith to share with you today.
I, and I offer, a gospel of doubt.
The gospel of doubt does not ask you to stop believing, but to believe in something new: that not believing is possible.
It is possible that the answers are false, that the questions themselves are false.
Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we, on this stage, in this room, are wrong.
Because it raises the question: "Why?"
With all the power we hold in our hands, why do people still suffer so much?
This doubt leads me to share that my organization, MBAs Across America, has ceased operations.
We have laid off our team and closed our doors, and we will freely share our model with anyone who grasps the power to do this work without waiting for our permission.
This doubt compels me to relinquish the role of savior that some expect from me, because there isn't not enough time and our chances are too slim to wait for seconds to come, when the truth is that there are no miracles here.
And this doubt, it rejuvenates me, it gives me hope, that when our problems overwhelm us, when the paths designed for us seem to lead us to our downfall, when our healersers brings no relief to our wounds, it won't be our blind faith - no, it will be our humble doubt that will illuminate a little bit of the darkness in our lives and our world, and allow us to raise our voices to whisper.
or to scream, or simply, very simply: "There must be another way."
Thank you.
