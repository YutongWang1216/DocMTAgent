Perhaps you are not familiar with Kenema in Sierra Leone or Arua in Nigeria.
For me, these are the two most extraordinary places on Earth.
In those hospitals, there is a community of nurses, doctors, and scientists who have quietly fought one of the deadliest threats to humanity for years: the Lassa virus.
The Lassa virus resembles the Ebola virus.
It can cause a strong fever and can often be fatal.
But these people risk their lives every day, to protect individuals within their communities, and ultimately, to protect us all.
One of the most extraordinary things I learned about them during one of my first visits, a long time ago, was that they start each morning - these tough mornings at the front lines - by singing.
They gather, and they show their joy and strength.
Over the years, we have visited each other. I could be among them, singing, and writing. It was extraordinary because it reminds us that we are not there solely for science, but that we are bound by a shared humanity.
You can imagine, it's extremely important, even vital, when things started to change.
The situation changed in March 2011, when the Ebola epidemic was declared in Guinea.
It was the first epidemic in West Africa, close to the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
It was terrifying... We were all terrified.
We had suspected for some time that the Lassa and Ebola viruses were more widespread than we thought, that they could reach Kenema.
Then, members of my team immediately joined Dr Humarr Khan and his team on the ground. We set up diagnostics to carry out molecular tests capable of detecting the arrival of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
We had already managed to control the Lassa virus. We knew how to do it, the team was exceptional.
"We simply had to give them the tools and the lab for Ebola."
Unfortunately, this day has arrived.
On May 23, 2014, a woman arrived at the maternity ward of the hospital. The team performed molecular tests and identified the first case of the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone.
This was an exceptional job.
They were able to diagnose the case immediately, treat the patient safely, and start to understand what was happening.
This could have prevented what happened.
"But on the day it happened, the epidemic had been spreading for several months."
There were already hundreds of cases, surpassing all previous outbreaks.
She entered Sierra Leone, not as this singular case, but as a tidal wave.
"We worked with the international community, the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to treat the cases. The following week there were 31, then 92, then 147 cases; they all came to Kenema, one of the only places in Sierra Leone that could handle this problem."
We worked tirelessly, trying everything possible to help each person and try to draw attention. We also did something else:
We didn't throw away the blood tests, used to detect Ebola, we put them in a chemical product to deactivate them. We packed them and shipped them across the ocean.
We sent them to Boston, where my team works.
We have also worked tirelessly, day after day. We rapidly generated 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
The genome is the blueprint of a virus.
We all have one.
It indicates what we are made of, and conveys so much information about us.
The results of this kind of work are simple and very useful.
We took these 99 different viruses, observed and compared them, and found to notice that, when compared to the three genomes that had been previously published in Guinea, the outbreak had emerged in Guinea several months earlier, and that, once in humans, it had been transmitted from human to human.
This is crucial when wanting to determine how to intervene, as detectingting contacts is paramount.
We also found that the virus mutated as it moved between humans.
Each mutation is important because the diagnostics, the vaccines, and our therapies are all based on the sequence of the genome. That's the guide.
World health experts need to react, develop, and re-calibrate all their work as a result.
However, science doesn't work like that. My position at the time was I had the data and could have worked in silence with them for months, carefully analyzing the data, slowly, submit an article for publication, make a few modifications, and finally publish my data after official publication.
Here is how the status quo works in science.
This time, there's no question of acting like that.
We had friends on the ground. For us, it was was obvious that we needed help, a lot of help...
The first thing we did, as soon as the machine spat out the first sequences, was been to publish them on the web.
We published them and launched a call for help.
The help has come!
Quickly, many people contacted us, surprised by the data we had published.
Some of the world's greatest infectious disease specialists were part of our community.
We worked together virtually, sharing regular calls, trying to track the virus minute by minute, to see how to stop it.
There are so many ways to form such communities.
Everyone, when the epidemic began to spread globally, wanted to learn, participate, and engage.
Everyone wanted to play a role.
The number of volunteers was incredible, and the Internet connected us all.
Can you imagine, instead of fearing each other, we said: "Okay, let's go, working together,
"We will conquer this virus."
The issue was that the data we were using, conducting research online, were too limited for our goal.
We miss a lot of opportunities in these cases.
Thus, when the epidemic struck Kenema, we had 106 clinical patient files, and we made them public.
In our lab, we demonstrated that, armed with these 106 files, we could teach our computers to predict Ebola with an accuracy of around 110%.
We have developed an application that provides access to this information for healthcare personnel on-site.
116 cases unfortunately are not enough to consolidate and validate the data.
So we were waiting for more data.
But we were still waiting for the data.
"We are still waiting, confined in our silos, instead of working together."
This situation is no longer tolerable.
"YouAll of you, you can't accept this anymore."
It's our lives on the line.
Many lives were lost, including that of healthcare workers, some of whom were dear to me. Five colleagues lost their lives: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Koroma, and Mohamed Fullah.
These are just five among many others in Kenema and beyond, dead while the world waited and we worked, quietly and separately.
Ebola, like all threats to humanity, is fueled by mistrust, confusion, and division.
As we build barriers between us, the virus grows.
Contrary to all other threats, in the face of Ebola, we are all equal.
"We are all on the same boat."
Ebola is at our doorstep for all of us.
"And so in this place, we share the same vulnerabilities, strengths, fears, and hopes, I wish that we could work together and with joy."
One of my former students was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and there she discovered that the term 'Kenema', the hospital where we work in Sierra Leone, comes from a Mende quote meaning 'clear like a river, translucent and open to the gaze'.
This had a particular significance for us, because, without knowing it, we had always believed that to honor individuals in Kenema, we needed to work openly and together.
"We must do it."
"WeWe must all demand of ourselves and others to be open to each other when an epidemic occurs, and to fight it together."
"Because it's neither the first Ebola epidemic nor the last one, and there are many other pathogens lurking around us, like the Lassa virus."
The next epidemic could hit a city with millions of inhabitants.
This could start here and spread through the air.
It could even be intentionally disseminated.
I know it's frightening, I understand... but I also know, this experience proves to us, that we have the technology and the capacity to conquer, to conquer and gain the upper hand over other viruses.
"But it is possible that if we collaborate in joy."
For Dr. Khan, and for all those who gave their lives, on the front lines, in this fight with us, let's stand alongside them in this struggle. Always.
Let's not leave the world marked by the destruction caused by a virus. Let's illuminate it with the glow of billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
Thank you.
