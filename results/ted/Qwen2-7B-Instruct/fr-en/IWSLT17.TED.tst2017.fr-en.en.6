Sometimes, I feel ashamed to be a European.
Last year, more than one million people in need of our help arrived in Europe and our response was been frankly pathetic.
There are so many contradictions.
We mourn the tragic death of Alan Kurdi, a two-year-old child, and yet, since then, over 200 children have drowned in the Mediterranean.
International treaties recognize that refugees are a collective responsibility, and yet we accept that tiny Lebanon hosts more Syrian refugees than all of Europe combined.
We lament the existence of smugglers, yet we make them the sole viable route for seeking asylum in Europe.
We are missing workforce, yet we prevent the people who match our economic and demographic needs from coming to Europe.
We proclaim our liberal values against fundamentalist Islam, yet - we have policies of repression that stop minor asylum seekers, that separate children from their family and that seize the belongings of refugees.
"What are we doing?"
"How did we get to this point where we adopt such inhuman responses to a humanitarian crisis?"
I don't believe it's due to a lack of interest, at least I don't want to believe that.
I believe it's because our politicians lack vision, they do not know how to adapt the international asylum rules, created over 50 years ago, to globalization.
"I want to take a step back and ask two fundamental questions, the two questions that we all must ask."
Firstly, why doesn't the current system work?
Secondly, how can we address this?
The current refugee regime was established following the consequences of World War II by these people.
The first is to ensure that when a state fails, or worse, turns against its people, people have a place to go, where to live safely and with dignity until they can return.
It was created precisely for situations like the current situation in Syria.
Through a international treaty signed by 148 governments, the 1951 Refugee Status Convention, and an international organization, the UNHCR, states have committed to reciprocally admit on their territory individuals fleeing conflict and persecution.
"But today, this system fails."
In theory, refugees have the right to claim asylum.
In practice, our immigration policies h barriers to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to integration or return to their country of origin.
But in practice, they remain stuck in eternal limbo.
Theoretically, refugees are a global shared responsibility.
Practically, geography means that countries near the conflict host the overwhelming majority of refugees.
The system isn't broken because the rules are bad.
yet because we do not apply them adequately to a changingable world, and this is what we need to reconsider.
I will explain how the current system works.
"How does the current refugee regime work?"
But not from an institutional perspective, rather from the viewpoint of a refugee.
Imagine a Syrian woman. Let's call her Amira.
For me, Amira represents
Many of the people I've met in the region.
Amira, like 25% of refugees worldwide, is a woman with children, and she cannot go back home because she comes from this city you see: Homs. A city that was once beautiful and historic and is now in ruins.
Amira cannot go back there.
But Amira has no hope of settling in a third country, because there's only a lottery available for less than 1% of refugees.
Amira and her family are confronted with an impossible choice.
They have three options.
The first option is for Amira to bring her family to a camp.
In the camp, she could be helped, but there is little prospect for Amira and her family.
The camps are located in austere and arid places, often in the desert.
In the Zaatari camp in Jordan, at night, you hear the bombings on the other side of the border.
The economic activity is limited.
Education is is often of poor quality.
In the world, approximately 80% of refugees who are in camps must remain there for at least 5 years.
It's a miserable life, and that's probably why, in reality, only 9% of Syrians choose this option.
An alternative for Amira is to head towards the urban area of a neighboring country, like Amman or Beirut.
This is an option chosen by about 85% of Syrian refugees.
But it also entails difficulties.
Refugees individuals in such urban areas often do not have the right to work.
They often don't have access to aid.
And so when Amira and her family have spent all their savings, they will have nothing left and will be in urban poverty.
There is is a third option that many Syrians increasingly opt for.
Amira might seek hope for her family by risking their lives in a dangerous and perilous journey to another country, which is what we see today in Europe.
We therefore offer refugees an almost impossible choice among three options: the camp, urban misery, or a perilous journey.
For refugees, this is the current refugee regime.
"But I believe it's a false choice."
"We can reconsider this choice."
The reason we limit these options is because we believe they are the only possible choices for refugees, but that's not the case.
The policies see this as a zero-sum game, if we benefit the refugees, the citizens pay the price.
"We tend to think of refugees as an inevitable cost or a burden for society."
But they don't have to be. They can contribute.
What I mean is, there are ways to increase the possibilities and that benefits everyone: the host countries and communities, our societies, and the refugees themselves.
And I want to suggest four ways to transform our view of refugees.
These four perspectives share one thing in common: they incorporate opportunities of globalization, mobility, and markets, and modernize our way of thinking about the refugee problem.
The first idea is about favorable environments. This starts with the fundamental recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but with extraordinary circumstances.
With my colleagues from Oxford, we embarked on a research project in Uganda, observing the economic life of refugees.
We chose Uganda, not because it represents all host countries.
It is exceptional.
Unlike most host countries, Uganda has provided an economic opportunity to refugees.
It gives them the right to work, the freedom to move.
And the results are extraordinary, for the refugees and for the host community.
In the capital, Kampala, we found discovered that 21% of refugees own a business employing people and 40% of these employees are nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees create jobs for the citizens of the host country.
Even within the camps, we have discovered examples of dynamic and thriving businesses.
For example, in a village called Nakivale, we have the example of a Congolese refugee leading a business of digital music sharing.
We found a Rwandan who leads a company to enable young people to play video games on recycled consoles and televisions.
Despite the difficulties of extreme constraints, refugees innovate, and the man you see is a Congolese named Demou-Kay.
Demou-Kay arriveded in the camp with very little belongings, but he wanted to become a director.
So, with friends and colleagues, he launched a community radio station, rented a camera, and directed films.
He has realized two documentaries with and for our team, and he is in the process of creating a thriving business with almost nothing.
These are the kinds of examples that should guide our response towards refugees.
Rather than seeing refugees inevitably dependent on humanitarian aid, we should provide them with the opportunity for human development.
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food are very important during the emergency phase, but we must go further.
We must offer the opportunity of connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, access to banks.
Everything that we consider as established, which integrates us into the global economy, can and should be offered to refugees.
The second idea I want to talk about is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all host countries worldwide have the approach that Uganda does.
Most host countries do not open their economies to refugees in this manner.
However, there are always pragmatic options that we can utilize.
In April, I went to Jordan with my colleague, the development economist, Paul Collier, and we contemplated an idea that we had there with the international community and the government, an idea to create jobs for Syrians while supporting Jordan's national development strategy.
This is the idea of an economic zone where we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees as well as the employment of the natives of the host country.
At 15 minutes from the Zaatari camp, which hosts 83,000 refugees, there is the King Hussein Bin Talal development zone.
The government has spent over $1 billion to connect it to the electrical grid and road network, but two things were missing: access to labor and foreign investment.
In order for refugees to be able to work there instead of being stuck in camps, support their families, develop skills through vocational training before returning to Syria.
We have recognized that Jordan would benefit, its development strategy requiring a step up from a middle-income country to an industrial country.
The refugees would benefit but it would also contribute to the reconstruction of Syria after the war, acknowledging that we must shoulder the burden of refugees as they are the best resource for rebuilding Syria.
We published this idea in the journal Foreign Affairs.
King Abdullah has taken up the idea.
This was announced at the London Syria conference, and a test will begin during the summer.
The third idea I want to present to you is the concept of preference between states and refugees leading to positive outcomes that you see in this selfie where Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee are depicted.
We rarely ask refugees what they want, where they want to go, but we can do it and it will be better for everyone.
The economist Alvin Roth has developed the concept of matching in, where the order of preference of the parties determines their potential correspondence.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym have sought ways to apply this idea to refugees, asking refugees to rank destinations, also allowing states to rank the type of refugee desired based on criteria such as skills or languages, then matching them.
Of course, we would need to implement quotas regarding diversity and vulnerability, but this is a way to increase the chances of matching.
The concept of matching is successfully applied, for example, in distributing students to universities, matching organ donors and patients, and the algorithm exists on dating sites.
Why not apply this to offer choice to refugees?
This could also be used at the national level where one of the biggest challenges is convincing local communities to accept refugees.
Currently, in my country for example, we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the city, which makes no sense.
Matching markets allow to gather these preferences and to hear the needs and requests of the host population and the refugees.
The fourth idea I want to discuss is the principle of humanitarian visa.
The tragedies and disorders observed in Europe could have been avoided.
They stem from a fundamental contradiction in European asylum policy: to seek asylum in Europe, you must embark on a dangerous journey, one that I've already discussed.
But why are these trips necessary in the age of low-cost airlines and modern consular means?
These trips are not necessary and last year they led to the death of over 3,000 people at the European borders and within European territory.
If refugees had the right to travel directly and request asylum in Europe, we would avoid this. And we can do this through humanitarian visas that allow people to obtain a visa from an embassy or consulate of a neighboring country, then paying for their journey by ferry or by plane to Europe.
It costs around 1,000 euros to pay a smuggler from Turkey to the Greek islands.
A low-cost flight from Bodrum to Frankfurt costs 200 euros.
If we allow refugees, it would have significant benefits.
It would save lives, reduce the demand for smugglers, and mark the end of the chaos observed at the first line of Europe in places like the Greek islands.
These are the laws that prevent us and not a rational solution.
This is an idea that has been implemented.
Brazil has adopted an innovative approach, and over 2,000 Syrians have obtained humanitarian visas, traveled to Brazil, and upon arrival, have sought refugee status.
In this setup, each Syrian who did this received the status of a refugee and was recognized as a refugee.
There is is a historical precedent.
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports were used as travel documents allowing 450,000 Assyrian, Turkish, and Chechen refugees to travel to Europe and seek refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
And the Nansen Refugee Agency received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this viable strategy.
Each of the four ideas I have presented to you are ways to expand Amira's choices.
These are means we have to increase the options for refugees beyond these three impossible options I've detailed, while benefitingting the others as well.
In conclusion, we need a new perspective, a vision that expands the options for refugees but acknowledges they are not a burden.
There is is nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost.
Yes, they are a humanitarian responsibility, but they are human beings with skills, talents, aspirations, and the ability to contribute, if we allow them to.
In the new world, migration will not stop.
What we have seen in Europe will continue for years.
People will still travel, populations will be displaced, and we must find rational and realistic ways to manage this, not based on the old logic of humanitarian aid, charity, but built on the opportunities offered by globalization, markets, and mobility.
I urge you to wake up and I urge our politicians to wake up to this challenge.
Thank you very much.
