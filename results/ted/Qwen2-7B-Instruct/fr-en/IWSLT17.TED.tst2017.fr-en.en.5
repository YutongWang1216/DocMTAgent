The food crisis
is in the news every day.
"But what is it?"
In certain parts of the world, there is either too little food, or perhaps too much.
Elsewhere, GMOss the world.
Perhaps GMOss the problem.
Too many agricultural runoff create toxic oceans, a drop in food supply.
And so on.
I find the current climate of this discussion incredibly discouraging.
"How can we bring this topic back to something we understand?"
"What does this apple tell us about the food crisis?"
"YouYou all ate an apple last week, I'm sure."
"What age do you think she was when she was picked?"
Two weeks.
Two months.
"Eleven months. That's the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the United States."
And I don't think it's very different in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
"We pick them, we put them in refrigerated warehouses, we gas the warehouses. In reality, there are documented evidence of workers trying to go into these environments to retrieve an apple, and who die because the atmosphere meant to slow down the apple's ripening is toxic for humans."
"How is it that none of you knew this?"
"Why didn't I know this?"
90% of this apple's quality, all the antioxidants, have left when it arrives at our place.
Actually, it's just a small ball of sugar.
"How little information do we have and how can we do better?"
I think what's missing is a platform.
I know the platforms. I know the computers. They stuck me in front of the internet when I was young.
I've done very strange things... on this platform.
"But I have met people, and I could express myself."
"How can one express oneself in the field of food?"
"If we had a platform, we could feel capable of asking: What if?
"How can one express oneself in the field of food?"
"Here is a map of the climate around the world."
The most productive areas in green, the least productive in red.
"They change, they replace each other, and now the California farmers are Mexican."
"China is acquiring land in Brazil to cultivate better food, and we are the slaves of the climate."
"And if each country had its own productive climate?"
"What would that change in the way we live?"
What would that change for the quality of life and nutrition?
The problem with the previous generation was having more food and having it cheaper.
"Welcome to your global farm."
"We have built a massive analog farm."
All these lines, these are the cars, the planes, the trains and transport.
It's a miracle that we feed seven billion people with only a few of us involved in food production.
"And what would happen if..."
"We were building a digital farm?"
A global digital farm.
"And if you could take this apple, digitize it somehow, send it as particles into the air, and reconstruct it on the other side?"
"What would happen?"
"Let's revisit some quotes. They inspire me in what I do."
The first: "Japanese agriculture has no childhood, no water, no land, and no future." That's what I discovered when I went to Minamisanriku, south of Fukushima, after the disaster.
"TheChildren have moved towards Sendai and Tokyo, the land is contaminated, they already import 77% of their own food."
"But this isn't just about Japan."
2% of the American population is involved in agriculture.
What good answer could come from just 2% of the population?
"By traveling around the world, 55% of the African population is under the age of 18."
80% of them don't want to become farmers.
Agriculture is is difficult.
The life of a small farmer entrepreneur is is miserable.
"They are moving towards the city."
"In India, farmers do not have access to basic services. There have been more farmer suicides this year than in the 10 previous years."
It makes one uneasy to talk about it.
"Where are they going?"
"In the city."
There are fewer young people, and everyone is leaving.
"So, how can we build a platform that would inspire the youth?"
Welcome to the new tractor.
This is my combine harvester.
A few years ago, I went to Bed Bath & Beyond, and Home Depot, and started hacking.
I've built stupid things, I made the plants dance, I connected them to my computer, and I killed them all; I've killed many.
I have finally managed to keep them alive.
And I created one of the most intimate relationships of my entire existence, because I was learning the language of the plant.
I wanted it to be bigger.
"They said to me: 'Enjoy yourself, young man!"
Here is an old electronics lab nobody wants.
"What can you do?"
With my team, we built a farm inside the Media Lab, a renowned place, not for biology, but rather for computer science.
Within these 6 square meters, we have produced enough food to feed around 3,000 people once a month. It's not much food.
There are plenty of interesting technologies in there.
But the most interesting thing?
Beautiful roots, white, green colors, deep, and a monthly harvest.
Is it a new cafeteria?
Is it a new retail shopping experience?
Is it a new grocery store?
I can assure you something: this is the first time someone in the Media Lab has dug up anything.
We have salad in packets, there's nothing wrong with that.
"But when you have an image processing expert, a data specialist, a roboticist, who dig out roots and think, 'I know a bit about this. I can do it, I want to try.' "
In this context, we would grow the plants and bring some back to the lab, because if you let them grow, you don't discard them, you become attached to them.
Now I have strange taste buds; I'm afraid to let anyone eat something without having tasted it myself, because I want it to be good.
I eat lacto every day and I can give its pH to 0,1 precision.
And I say: "No, its pH is 6.1, you cannot eat it today."
That lactate that day was exceptionally sweet.
It was exceptionally sweet because the plant was stressed and she had induced a chemical reaction within her to protect herself: "I'm not going to die!"
"And the plants that don't want to die, seem sweet to me."
The technologists are being overturned by plant physiology.
We thought that other people should be able to try.
"We wanted to see what people can create, so we designed a lab that can be shipped anywhere."
Then we built it.
On the facade of the Media Lab, there's my laboratory, which has around 30 detection points per plant.
"If you know about the genome or genetics, this is the phenotype, okay?"
The phenomena.
"When you say: 'I love Mexican strawberries,' you really love the climate that produced the expression you like."
So, if you code the climate - this amount of CO2 and this amount of oxygen creates a recipe - you're coding the expression of this plant, the nutrition of this plant, the size of this plant, the shape, the color, the texture.
We need data, so we've put a lot of sensors to tell us what's happening.
Consider your indoor plants! You're extremely sad because you're wondering, "Why are you dying? Why aren't you not talking to me?"
Farmersers reach they cross the 60 or 77 year mark, farmers gain a unique ability.
They can say when a plant dies it's due to a lack of nitrogen, a lack of calcium, or that it needs more water.
This unique ability does not get passed on.
These are the signs of the "farmer in the cloud".
"We follow these data over time."
We correlate them with specific plants.
These are all the broccoli in my laboratory, by IP address.
"Our broccoli are accessible by IP address."
And if that isn't not strange enough, you click once and get the profile of a plant.
And this gives you the downloadable evolution of this plant, but not as you think, not just when it's ready.
"When does she reach the nutrition I need?"
"When does she reach the desired taste?"
"Is she receiving too much water?"
Does she receive too much sunlight?
"Alert alerts."
She can talk to her, she dialogues, we have a language.
I think she is the first plant user on Facebook!
This is her plant profile and this plant is going to start making friends.
I believe: she will make friends with other plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, less potassium.
We will learn more about a complexity that we could only assume.
Perhaps they won't become our friends, perhaps they will, it depends on us.
This is my laboratory.
He is a bit more organized, my job is to design data centers for hospitals, so I know well the creation of controlled environments.
"And therefore, inside this environment, we experiment all sorts of things."
This aeroponic process was was developed by NASA for the Mir space station to reduce the amount of water sent into space.
This process gives exactly what the plant wants: water, minerals, and oxygen.
The roots aren't complicated. When you give them this, you get an astonishing result.
It's as if the plant has two hearts.
And because she has two hearts, it grows four times or five times faster.
It's a perfect world.
"We have advanced in tech and seeds for a hostile world and we will continue to do so, but we also have a new tool, which is a perfect world."
"We have grown all sorts of things."
These tomatoes hadn't been produced and sold for 155 years.
"Do you know that we have rare and old seed banks?
"Seed banks."
It's amazing.
They have genetic material, things you've never eaten.
I am the only person in this room who has eaten this kind of tomato.
It's a sauce tomato that we don't know how to cook. We ate this tomato. And it wasn't not great.
"We've done things with proteins, all sorts of things."
"We've grown humans. Maybe you could do it, but we didn't."
What we have achieved is... that the tool was too big, and too expensive.
I started distributing it around the world and it cost about $100,000.
Finding someone with $111,111 in their pocket isn't easy, so we looked to make it smaller.
This was the project of one of my first-year engineering student, Camille.
Camille, myself, and the whole team tried everything all summer to make it cheaper, to make it work better, so that others could do it too.
"We have placed them in schools, from sixth grade to high school."
And if you want to stay humble, try teaching children.
"I went to the school and said: 'Set the humidity to 65%.'"
"A middle school student asked me: 'What is is humidity?'"
"I replied: 'There is water in the air.'"
"He said: 'There isn't no water in the air, you're an idiot.'"
"And I replied: "Very well...
"Don't trust me."
"Set it to 110."
"He sets it to 111 and what happens?"
It starts to condense, create fog, and eventually, droplets.
"And he says: 'Oh. Humidity is is rain.'
"Why didn't you tell me?"
"We have created an interface like that of a game."
"They have a 3D environment, they can connect anywhere in the world from their smartphone or tablet."
They have the different parts of the bots, the sensors.
"They choose recipes created by other children all around the world."
"They select and activate this recipe, they sow a seed."
"As it grows, they make changes."
"Why does a plant need CO2?"
"Why is is CO2 bad? It's hurting people!"
Increase the CO2, the plant dies.
Decrease the CO2, the plant is doing very well.
Harvest the plant, you have just created a new digital recipe.
This is a design, an iterative development, and an exploration process.
They can download all the data on this new plant they have developed or the new digital recipe and what it did - was it better or worse?
Imagine this as the tiny hearts of the process.
"We are going to learn so much."
Here is one of our regular-foods items, as we call them, after three weeks in a school.
It's three weeks of growth.
"But more importantly, it was the first time this kid thought he could be a farmer - or that he might want to be a farmer."
"We have put everything in open source."
Everything is online; try building your first edible computer.
"It's going to be tough - I'm tellinging you."
"We are just at the beginning, but everything is is here."
It's very important to me that it be easily accessible.
"We are going to continue in this direction."
These are farmers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental scientists, computer scientists, plant scientists, economists, urban planners,
On a unique platform, doing what they are good at.
"But we had a bit too ambitious."
This is my new setup that we have just launched.
This warehouse could be anywhere.
That's why I chose it.
And inside this warehouse, we will going to build something like this.
Those already exist.
Look at this.
Those also exist.
One allows growing green, the other allows producing the Ebola vaccine.
It's cool that this factory, a big winner of the DARPA challenge, is one of the reasons for progress on Ebola.
The factories were producinging the protein that resists the Ebola virus.
From pharmaceutical products, nutaceuticals, to the simple milk product.
"But these two things are completely different, and that's where I am in my field."
Everything is different.
"We're at this strange stage of 'We're almost there.' It's a bit like 'Here's my black box.' -- No, buy mine."
"No, no - I have the intellectual property, perfectlyly valid."
"Don't buy his, buy mine."
"Actually, we're just at the beginning, at a time when society is is also changing."
As we ask for more food but cheaper, we are askinging for better food that respects the environment.
"When you have a McDonald's ad explaining what's inside the McNugs, - the most mysterious food product of all time - upon which their marketing campaign is founded, everything is in the process of changing."
From now on,
The edible personal computers, food servers, and food data centers operate on the open phenoome.
Think genome open, but we will add small climate recipes, like Wikipedia, that you can retrieve, update, and make grow.
What does it look like in reality?
Do you remember the planet connected by lines?
We are starting to have the tags.
We are starting to send information about food, rather than sending the food itself.
This is not only my dream, these are the places where we are already deploying.
Food computers, food servers, soon food data centers, connecting people to share information.
The future of food isn't't fighting against what isn't going wrong.
We know what is going wrong.
The future of food lies in networking the next billion farmers and empowering them with a platform to pose and answer the question, "What if?"
Thank you.
