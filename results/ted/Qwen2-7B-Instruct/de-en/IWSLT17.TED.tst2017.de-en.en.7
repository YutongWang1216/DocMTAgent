I am a neurosurgeon.
As most of my colleagues, I deal with human tragedies every day.
I know how your life can change from one moment to the next, after a severe stroke or a car accident.
For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity for self-healinging.
After a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.
This probably explains why I became a functional neurosurgeon.
What is a functional neurosurgeon?
A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical measures.
They must have heard of one of the most famous ones, called "Deep Brain Stimulation". In this procedure, an electrode is implanted deep within the brain to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved.
It is truly remarkable technology. It has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, who suffered severely from tremors and intense pain.
However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healinging.
The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.
In my opinion, we are getting closer to this dream.
I want to show you that we are very close to it.
With a little help, the brain can help itself.
The story began 15 years ago.
At the time, I was the leading senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.
Often, I treated patients with skull-head trauma.
Imagine, in cases of skull-head trauma, the brain swells and the intracranial pressure increases.
To save a life, one must reduce the intracranial pressure.
For that, one sometimes has to remove a part of the swollen brain mass.
Instead of discarding the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze it with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.
What do I mean by that?
We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.
This is not an easy task.
Growing cells from a tissue piece is comparable to having little kids taken out from your family.
One must find the right nutrition, temperature, humidity, and environment to allow them to thrive.
Exactly what we had to do with these cells.
After many trials, Jean-François succeeded.
He saw it under his microscope.
That was a big surprise for us.
"Why?"
It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. With large green cells surrounded by smaller, immature cells.
Perhaps you still remember from biology lessons that stem cells are immature cells that can transform into any cell type of the organism.
The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. They are hidden in deep, small nicheses of the brain.
It's surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the superficial tissue of the brain mass in surgery.
We made another fascinating observation: Normal stem cells are very active - they divide very quickly.
They never die, they are immortal.
But these cells behaved differently.
They divided slowly and even died after a few weeks.
We therefore observed a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.
It took us a long time to understand where they came from.
They originate from these cells.
These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.
We all have them in our brain.
They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.
These cells play a very important role in our development.
In the fetal stage, they are responsible for folding the brain.
But why do they remain with us?
We don't know that.
We believe they play a role in brain healing, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries.
However, this is not so certain.
However, one thing is clear -- these cells provided us with our stem cells.
We stand upon a potential cell source that enables brain healing.
We had to prove it.
We decided to develop an experiment.
"We wanted to take a piece of non-verbal brain tissue and cultivate the cells just as Jean-François did."
and then color them to track them in the brain.
In the final step, we reimplanted them at the site of removal from the same individual.
We call this autologous transplantation -- autotransplantation.
One of our first questions was: What happens if we implant these cells into normal brain tissue? And what will happen if we implant the same cells into damaged brain tissue?
Thanks to the assistance of Professor Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.
In the first scenario, we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks, they completely disappeared, as if they had been taken again, they go back home. The space is already occupied, they won't be needed there, so they disappear.
In the second scenario, we introduced damage and reimplanted exactly the same cells, and now the cells remained - they grew into mature neurons.
Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.
These are the cells that were reimplanted.
The proof she show are these small points. These are the cells we colored in vitro, in the culture.
Of course, we couldn't not stop here.
Do these cells also help a monkey recover from a brain injury?
Also we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.
They had to take feed pellets from a tray.
They did that very well.
When they achieved a stable level of dexterity, we deactivated the hand motor area in the motor cortex.
Following this, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.
Just like it would happen with humans, they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.
The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. They recover to a certain extent, just like the monkeys.
When we were sure that the monkey had reached its level of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.
On the left side, you see the monkey that recovered spontaneously.
He can achieve approximately 40% to 55% of his original performance before the injury.
He is not as precise and not as fast.
Now, see this when we reimplanted the cells: The same monkey, two months after reimplantation.
I can tell you, those were also very exciting results for us.
Since then, we have learned much more about these cells.
We can freeze them and use them later.
We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.
But our dream is still to implant them in humans.
I really hope that I will soon be able to show you how the human brain provides us with the means to heal ourselves.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Jocelyn, this is wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, are thinking: "I know someone who needs this."
I will definitely do that.
Of course, the biggest obstacles are the questions you must overcome before you can start clinical studies on humans.
Jocelyn Bloch: The biggest obstacles are the authorities. Starting from these great results, one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to conduct this type of study.
BG: That's understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.
JF: Yes, but it requires a long time, a lot of patience, and almost a professional team.
BG: Look into the future - you've completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. If you look further into the future, how many years will it take until someone can come to the hospital and receive this therapy.
JB: It's hard to say.
Firstly, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.
Will the authority allow us to start soon?
Then one must conduct this study with a small group of patients.
It takes a long time to select the patients to undergo treatments and evaluate whether it is beneficial to perform this kind of treatment.
Afterwards, one must apply this to a multicenter study.
One must first prove that it is beneficial before offering this treatment to anyone.
BG: And that it is safe, of course. JB: Of course.
BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit at TED and for telling us about it.
BG: Thank you.
