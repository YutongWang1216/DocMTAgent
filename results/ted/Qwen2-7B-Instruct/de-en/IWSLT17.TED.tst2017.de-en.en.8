Democracy.
"We in the West make a big mistake by considering them as self-evident."
"We see democracy not as the fragile plant it really is, but as part of our society's's inventory."
"We tend to see them as unchangeable facts."
"We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy."
"That is not true."
"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his major imitators in Beijing have undoubtedly shown that it is possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remain completely undemocratic."
Actually, democracy is fading in Europe.
At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece - the newly elected Greek government - it was made abundantly clear to me as the Finance Minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country - our elections - should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece.
"At this moment, I thought that there could hardly be a better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or perhaps some of my more vocal friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if anything were changed."
"At this point, I would like to present you with an economic model for a genuine democracy."
I ask you to believe, alongside me, that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup fall prey to a delusion, we could save democracy, but rather, that we need a true and robust democracy.
"Because without democracy, our societies will become meaner, our future bleak, and our magnificent, new technologies wasted."
"Regarding the topic of waste, I would like to draw your attention to an interesting contradiction that is currently plaguing our economies."
I call it the "twin summit paradox ".
A summit is known to you. You recognize and identify it as the debt mountain casting its long shadow over the USA, Europe, and the entire world.
"We all recognize the debt mountain,"
yet only few recognize his twin.
A mountain of unused liquidity, owned by the wealthy saversers and corporations, but they are too fearful to invest it where it would be productive and generate income, which could be used to chip away at the debt mountain and produce all the things humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.
I will give you two numbers for that.
In the past three months, a total of $3.4 trillion has been invested in the US, UK, and Eurozone combined, in all the goods that generate wealth, such as industrial facilities, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on and so forth.
$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion that was swirling around in the same countries and our financial institutions at the same time, and doing absolutely nothing except puff up the stock markets and drive up property prices.
So, debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that cannot be balanced out through regular market mechanisms.
The outcome is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan, and Europe being unemployed, and consequently low overall economic demand, which, like in a vicious cycle, amplifies the pessimismism of investors fearing low demand and thus contributing to it by not investing. Just like Oedipus' father, who out of fear that the prophecy of the oracle could come true, that his son would kill him when he grows up,
Unintentionally, the circumstances lead to Oedipus killing his father.
This is my criticism of capitalism --
His extraordinarily wasteful manner. All this non-productive capital should be put to use, improving our lives, further developing human talents, and especially funding all these technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for saving the Earth.
Is democracy the solution?
I believe so. But before we continue: What do we understand by democracy?
Aristotle defined democracy as the societal form where the free and the poor control the government as the majority.
The Athenian democracy, of course, excluded many --
Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.
It would, however, be a mistake to underestimate the significance of the Athenian democracy due to these exclusions.
The crucial aspect of the Athenian democracy was, and still is, that it included the working poor, not only granting them the right to freee speech, but more importantly and decisively, it granted them the right to political co-determination with equal voting weight in matters of state affairs.
The Athenian democracy may not have lasted long --
Like a candle that shines very brightly, it is also quickly burnt out.
However, our contemporary liberal democracies do not stem from ancient Athens,
but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.
While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and empowered the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, ultimately a charter for the rulers.
Because liberal democracy only came into existence when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible, and the democratic process was confined to politics, while the economy - that the world of corporations - became a non-democratic zone.
In our current democracies, since the point at which this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle has taken place between the two, with the economy gradually undermining and disempowering politics.
Are you surprised why politicians are not like they used to be?
It's not due to a degeneration of their DNA.
It is due to the fact that one can be in government today and yet not hold power, because the power of politics has shifted to the economy and the sectors have been separated.
This is my criticism of capitalism.
When you think about it, it's somewhat like a herd of predators that have so sustainably decimated the prey they feeds on, that they end up starving themselves at the end.
Similarly, this is with the economy, which the politics has cannibalized to such extent that it hurts itself through the self-induced economic crisis. The might of corporations grows, political qualities are devalued, inequality rises, overall demand falls, and the CEOs of corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.
The more successfully capitalism expels the "Demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher the twin summits, and the greater the waste of human labor power and the prosperity of mankind.
If that be the case, it is obvious that we need to bring together the politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the "Demos" keeps control, just as in in ancient Athens, apart from excluding the slaves, women, and foreigners.
This is not a new idea.
The Marxist left had this idea already over 100 years ago and it didn't go particularly well.
The lesson from the turmoil of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position akin to ancient Athens through through a miracle, without creating new forms of brutality and waste.
"But there is a solution: Abolish the working poor!"
Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workersers with automation and robots.
The issue here is, as long as economy and politics remain separate fields, automation makes the twin summits rise higher, the waste becomes more exalted, and the social conflicts deepen, just as I believe it will soon come to be in countries like China.
We must also reshape the economy and reunite the sectors of economics and politics, and pay attention to democratizing the reunited field, or else we'll end up in a sickening surveillance-hyper-autocracy that makes the movie "Matrix" look like a documentary.
The question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has fostered.
The more intriguing question is whether capitalism will be replaced by a dystopia akin to "Matrix", or something resembling what society in "Star Trek" offers, where machines serve people and humanity invests their energy into exploring the universe, or a high-tech version of ancient Athenian "Agora", where people revel in long discussions about the meaning of life.
I believe we should be optimistic.
What would it take, how could it look, this "Star Trek"-like utopia instead of the "Matrix"-like dystopia?
In practical implementation, I would like to briefly provide you with some examples.
In the realm of businesses: imagine a capital market where you earn money while working, and where your capital follows you from job to job, from company to company, and the company - regardless of which one you're currently working at - belongs to those who are currently working in the company.
Then all incomes stem from capital and gains, and the concept of wage labor is entirely outdated.
No more distinction between those who belong to the companies but don't work there, and employees who do work there, but the company doesn't belong to them. No more drawing of threads between capital and labor, no large gaps between investment and saving, and ultimately no towering twin summits.
In the field of global political economics: please, imagine that our national currencies had a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of the 22 largest middle-income countries] for the benefit of humanity as a whole.
Continue to envision that the entire world trade is conducted in this currency - let's call it "Cosmos" in units of "Cosmos" - and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or surplus of the respective country into a common fund.
Imagine as well that this fund is invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment resources are scarce.
This is not a new idea.
It is fundamentally what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.
The problem was that one did not have the technical means to implement it at the time.
Today, we have them, particularly in the context of reunited politics and economics.
The world I describe is libertarian, preferring privileged individuals, and Marxist, as it will bury the separation of capital and labor in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian.
But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.
Will we awaken in such a world?
or will we sink into a "Matrix"-like dystopia?
The answer depends on how we collectively make political decisions together.
It lies in our hands, and we do it better democratically.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Yanis...
You portray yourself in your biography as a libertarian Marxist.
How relevant is Marx' analysis today?
Yanis Varoufakis: If anything I've said is here matters, then Marx matters.
The reason for reunifying politics and economics is... If we don't, technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall economic demand, as Larry Summers refers to as "long-term stagnation".
Through the transfer of this crisis from one part of the earth to the next, as we currently experience it, not only our democracies will be destabilized, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.
If this analysis is correct, then Marx is indeed relevant.
Just like Hayek, hence I am a libertarian Marxist, and just like Keynes, hence I am also completely absurd.
BG: In fact, and now it's us.
<English translation> YV: If one is not absurd, one doesn't think precisely.
BG: This is a very Greek, sort of philosophical explanation - 
Do you want me to repeat it here?
YV: There is a great deal of hypocrisy.
In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.
As I stated in my lecture, we have confined democracy to politics, while the sector where most of the action takes place - the economic sector - is a completely democrafreie zone.
In a certain way, if I may say provocatively, China today resembles England in the 19th century.
Because - remember - we tend to associate liberalism with democracy - that's a historical mistake.
Liberalism, Liberal, as in John Stuart Mill --
He was particularly skeptical when it comes to democratic development.
What is being observed in China now is very reminiscent of the development we had in England during the Industrial Revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second stage.
Accusing China of doing what the West did itself in the 19th century smells strongly of hypocrisy.
BG: I am certain that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.
YV: I knew this was coming.
BG: Yes...
How do you look back on the first half of the year six months later?
YV: Very exciting, personally, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start anew with the Eurozone,
not just Greece, but the Eurozone,
namely to bid farewell to our arrogance, and the continuous deception that a massive rejection line ran through the Eurozone and continues to run, threatening the development of the entire European Union.
We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal - in you see, the first proposal revealed this deception -
To do it right. Unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the Eurogroup, have continued to choose deception.
"But you know, it's coming."
This is the experience from the Soviet Union --
When one tries to keep a non-viable economic system alive through political will and authoritarianism, perhaps one can delay it for a while, yet when the change comes, it does so abruptly and destructively.
BG: What changes do you foresee?
YV: There is is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we don't change its construction.
BG: Have you made any mistakes during your time as Finance Minister?
YV: Every day.
BG: For example? YV: Anyone who looks back -- seriously...
If there is a Finance Minister, or any Minister, who claims after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, that they he has made no mistakes, then that is a dangerous person.
Of course, I have made mistakes.
The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.
I believed that there was a genuine interest on the part of the creditors for a joint solution to be found.
But that didn't exist.
They merely wanted to bring down our government, just because they they didn't want to deal with the degradations that were flowing from the Eurozone.
They didn't want to admit that they had been conducting a disastrous program in Greece for five years.
We lost one third of our nominal GDP.
That's worse than during the "Great Depression".
None of the Troika's money lenders, who imposed this policy upon us, admitted: "That was a colossal mistake."
BG: Despite all of this, and despite the aggressive tone of the discussions, you seem to still be quite pro-European.
YV: Absolutely.
My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from someone who lives and breathes Europe.
My biggest fear is that the Eurozone will survive.
For if they do not survive, the releaseded forces will be diabolical and will destroy the European Union.
This will not only have catastrophic consequences for Europe, but for the entire world economy.
We are probablyly the strongest economy in the world.
If we allow ourselves to take the path of postmodernism in 1930, as it seems to me, it will be equally detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.
BG: We hope very much that you are wrong on this point.
Yanis, thank you for being at TED.
YV: Thank you.
