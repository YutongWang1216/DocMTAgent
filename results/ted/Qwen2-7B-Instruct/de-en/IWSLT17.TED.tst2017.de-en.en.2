This is the story of how I was once almost kidnapped and would have ended up in the trunk of a red Mazda.
A day after I had completed my design studies, I held a backyard sale.
A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.
He bought one of my artworks.
He was alone in the city and was just on a road trip through the whole country. Afterwards, he would go to the peace corps.
I invited him for a beer. He enthusiastically told me how he wanted to change the world.
It got late. I got tired.
While we were paying the bill, I made the mistake of asking him: "Where are you sleeping tonight?"
He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know it yet."
And I thought: "Oh, man!
What am I doing now?
Who doesn't't know the situation?
Do I have to offer a place to sleep now?
But I just met him! He says he's going to the peace corps, but I don't really know if he plans that. I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazda!
This is a small trunk!
Then I heard myself say: "I have an air mattress. You can sleep in my living room."
A voice in my head said: "Um, what?"
At night, I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling and thinking: "Oh man! What have I gotten myself into?
A stranger is sleeping in my living room.
"What if he's crazy?"
I got so scared that I got out of bed, tiptoed to the door, and locked my bedroom door.
But he wasn't not crazy at all.
We are still in contact.
The artwork he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. He is now a teacher.
That was my first experience as a host. It completely transformed my perspective.
Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends waiting to be discovered?
Hosting people on my air mattress became normal for me. When I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with me.
Let's skip ahead in time, two years later...
I am unemployed, nearly broke, my roommate moved out, and the rent is being increased.
I found out that there was a design conference in the city at that time. All hotels were booked out.
I believe creativity can turn fear into fun.
I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I've been thinking about how we could make some money. Our apartment will become a designer Bed and Breakfast. Young designers can stay with us, with WiFi and a desk included, plus a mattress and breakfast every morning."
"Wow!"
We created a website and thus founded "AirMatress and Breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].
Three lucky guests were able to sleep on our wooden floor on the air mattress for $20.
They found it great, and so did we.
I'm sure that our cheese ham omelets tasted completely differently because we made them for our guests.
We toured the city with them. When we said goodbye to our last guest and the door closed, Brian and I looked at each other.
Did we just realize that we could find new friends and pay our rent at the same time?
The things started rolling.
My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.
We wanted to find out if it could be turned into a business concept.
So we presented ourselves to the investors: "We want to create a website where people can post publicly pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms - the kind of rooms whose doors you close when guests leave.
They can then invite total strangers over the internet to stay with them.
That's going to be the next big thing!
We waited for the rocket to ignite.
She didn't.
No one who is still in a state of mind would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in other people's apartments.
Why?
Because we all learned as children that strangers are dangerous.
When you have a problem, you think about the things you're good at. We could design.
At the art academy, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and tactility - it's the overall experience.
We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before, through design.
Can design do something like that?
Can design create trust?
I want to give you a sample of the level of trust we aimed for.
It's a 30-second experiment. It will force you out of your comfort zone.
Thumb up if you're ready.
Take your phone in hand.
Now I would like you to unlock your phone.
Give your unlocked phone to your left seat companion.
This subtle surge of panic that you're experiencing now - this is exactly what hosts feel when they first open the door.
Because the only thing more personal than your phone is your home.
Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your bathroom.
How does it feel to hold the unlocked phone of a stranger in your hands?
Most feel the responsibility.
Most guests also feel this way when they stay somewhere else.
Only for this reason can our company exist.
Just to clarify, who does Al Gore actually have his phone with now?
Could you please announce on Twitter that he is running for the office of President?
You can give the phone back now.
You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some of our discoveries.
What if we had altered a small detail in this experiment?
What if your neighbor had introduced himself by name first; if he had told you where he comes from, what his dog or children's names are?
Imagine if you had 155 reviews all saying: "He can really hold an unlocked phone very well!"
How would you then feel if you had to hand in your phone?
Because a well thought-out feedback system strongly reinforces trust.
At the beginning, we still made some things wrong.
It was difficult for people to give negative evaluations.
In the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their evaluations before posting them online.
Last week, we discovered something new.
We conducted a study with Stanford. We investigated how likely it is for people to trust each other, depending on how similar they are in terms of age and place of residence.
Surprisingly, we tend to trust those most who are most similar to us.
The more differences we find, the less we trust.
This is a natural social bias.
Excitingly, when adding the reputation of a person - in our case through reviews.
If you have less than three reviews, nothing changes.
But if you have more than ten, everything changes.
A good reputation highlights similarities.
The right design can thus help us overcome some of our deeply ingrained preferences.
Furthermore, we learned that trust depends on how much one is willing to reveal about oneself.
Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.
If one doesn't tell enough, for example "Hi!", one gets rather no response.
If one tells too much, for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is not accepted either.
There is exists an optimal degree of openness, for example, "Great artworks in your apartment! I'm on vacation with my family."
How can design achieve this optimal degree of openness?
We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. We also provide tips on what topics one should write about.
Our entire business is based on the hope that the right design can help us overcome our prejudices towards strangers.
What we hadn't anticipated was the large number of people willing to set aside these prejudices.
Here you see how many people are taking advantage of our offer.
One can recognize three things.
Firstly: incredibly good luck.
Secondly: the tireless work of our team.
Thirdly: a need that had not been covered before.
Our business is runningning very smoothly at the moment.
Of course, there are also times when everything doesn't run smoothly.
There were guests who threw unauthorized parties or trashed apartments.
Hostsers have left guests in the rain.
At the beginning of the project, I worked in customer service. All calls went directly to my phone.
I was at the forefront when trust was broken.
There is nothing worse than these calls. It already hurts just to think about them.
The disappointment one hears in the callers' voices has always been and will continue to be our biggest motivation to keep improving.
Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million mediated overnight stays had any issues.
Because people do trust each other rightfully.
When trust works, wonderful things can happen.
One of our guests went on vacation in Uruguay. There he suffered a heart attack.
His host drove him to the hospital.
He even donated blood for the necessary operation!
Here is his evaluation.
"Perfect house for travelers prone to heart attacks due to sitting tasks."
The area is beautiful and well-equipped with sufficient hospitals.
Javier and Alejandra are true angels of protection, saving lives even though they don't know you properly.
They drive you to the hospital in their own car if you die, and wait while you get a bypass.
Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books over.
They even let you stay longer without calculating the extra nights.
I can only recommend it!
Of course, every stay doesn't run smoothly.
But these relationships behind the pure financial transaction are exactly what one aims to achieve with the Sharing Economy.
When I first stumbled upon this term, I wondered...
How does the concept of sharing fit with monetary transactions?
It's about a financial transaction.
But simply calling it "the rental industry" now won't do justice to the matter.
Sharing Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.
People open up a part of themselves, and that changes everything.
"When traveling these days, it's comparable to fast food. It's efficient and reliable, but less authentic."
What if if, if travels would be a rich buffet of local impressions?
What if if at every place one visits, there would be a group of locals waiting there to thoroughly debrief one after a bar tour showing one quarter of which one has never heard of;
or if one could learn to cook from a five-star chef?
Today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.
What if we designed apartments from scratch for sharing?
What would that look like?
What if cities embraced the idea of shared participation?
I envision cities that provide company and connections instead of loneliness and isolation.
In South Korea's capital city, Seoul, this project has already begun. Many parking spaces that belonged to the government,
were now being offered to residents. Students who were looking for a place to stay,
were offered to people whose children had moved out. Incubator programs were started,
to be able to finance new startups in the Sharing Economy. Alone through our platform, 855,000 people are guests in a stranger's home or host themselves tonight in 191 countries.
The idea doesn't seem quite as crazy as we've been taught.
"We haven not reinvented the wheel."
Hospitality existed before as well.
There were already similar websites before us.
"Why is did our function just now?"
Apart from luck and timing, we realized that one can find the right design with the components of trust.
Design can help us overcome deeply entrenched prejudices.
I find that astonishing,
Absolutely overwhelming.
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.
We of course know that design cannot solve every problem.
But if it could help us when it had this large impact, I wonder what we can first use design for.
Thank you.
