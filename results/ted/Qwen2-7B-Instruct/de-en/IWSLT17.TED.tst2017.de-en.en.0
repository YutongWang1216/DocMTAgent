This is James Risen.
They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.
Before anyone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he spectacularly published that the NSA had illegally eavesdropped on Americans' phones.
But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.
In it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation where the CIA literally handed over blueprints for an atomic bomb to Iran.
If it sounds crazy, read it.
It's an incredible story.
But do you know who didn't like this chapter at all?
The US government.
Almost 10 years the government has been investigating against Risen and urging him to name his alleged sources.
In this move, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, to condemn whistleblowers and spy on journalists.
According to the First Amendment, the media have the right to publish secret information.
But it is impossible to exercise this right if the media do not obtain these information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones who they disclose.
Also when the government knocked at Risen's door, he did something that many brave reporters had done before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail.
From 2000 to 2015, Risen lived also with the risk of going to jail.
But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.
Suddenly, although they had claimed for years that it was essential for their case, the demands of the government towards Risen were dropped.
The reason: in times of electronic surveillance, reporters and sources can hide less and less.
Instead of failing and getting Risen to confess, this could also take care of his digital footprint for him.
And so, the investigators, without his consent, have gradually secured his phone calls in secret.
Just like his email data, financial and bank information, credit report, and even travel records including a list of his flights.
In the midst of these information, they found evidence which they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source.
Unfortunately, this is just one of many cases.
President Obama promised during his inauguration to protect whistleblowers. But instead, the justice system has convicted more people than all previous US governments combined.
Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially since the government classifies too much of its work as secret.
Since September 11th, almost every article about national security was the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.
We thus put the press work at risk, which is supposed to be protected by the first amendment, because the government has more and more ways to find out everything.
But just like technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.
And this can happen starting from the moment they come into contact, rather than retrospectively, in the witness stand.
Today there is communication software available that did not exist when Risen wrote his book, and it is significantly safer than regular emails or telephone calls.
Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open-source submission system for whistleblowers originally developed by the internet celebrity, the late Aaron Swartz, and is now further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work.
Instead of sending an email, you go to a news website like this one, the Washington Post.
In this place, you can upload documents or send information, just like with any regular contact form.
These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access.
Therefore, the government can no longer secretly amass information, and many of the information it would request would be unavailable from the start.
SecureDrop is but only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.
Unfortunately, governments around the world are constantly developing new espionage technologies that threaten us all.
It is our responsibility to ensure that not only technology experts like Edward Snowden have the means to expose wrongdoing. It is equally important that we protect the next whistleblower.
The next whistleblower who wants to report about malfunctions in the provision for soldiers and overcrowded hospitals. Or the next environmental activist who alerts us about contaminated water in Flint. Or a Wall Street insider warning us about the next financial crisis.
These technologies were not only made for those who wish to uncover crimes, but also to safeguard the constitutional rights of us all.
Thank you.
