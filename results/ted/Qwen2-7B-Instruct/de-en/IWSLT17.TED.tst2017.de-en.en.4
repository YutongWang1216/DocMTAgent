What started as a platform for tinkerers is about to become a billion-dollar business.
Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film, and journalism - these are just some of the potential applications areas for commercial drones. This is being made possible in research institutions worldwide.
Before air parcel delivery became part of our societal awareness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the FRac Centre in France built a six-meter tall tower out of 1,500 bricks live in front of an audience. A few years ago, they began flying with ropes.
By connecting them sequentially, the flying devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest space.
They can also construct self-loadable structures independently.
They have learned to bear loads, cope with turbulence, and generally react to natural laws.
Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.
Our goal is to transcend the limits of what is possible in autonomous flight.
In order for a system to function autonomously, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in space.
In our lab at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. This then allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.
For today's's demonstrations, we're usinging a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our lab.
There are no external cameras.
Each flying vehicle has internal sensors to determine its position in space, computations on board dictate what the vehicle should do.
External commands exist at the highest level. For example, "start" and "land".
This is a so-called rear starter.
an aircraft trying to hit two birds with one stone
Like other fixed-wing aircraft, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.
In contrast to most fixed-wing aircraft, it can hover, giving it significant advantages during takeoff and landing, and is very versatile.
However, there is always a flip side.
A limitation of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.
We are developing new controls and algorithms to improve this.
The idea behind it is that the flying device can regain the optimal position regardless of its location and performance can be improved through practice.
Okay.
During our research, we often pose fundamental abstract questions that get right to the heart of the matter.
Such a question might be: What is the smallest number of movable parts for controlled flights?
There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.
Drones are roughly known as machines with a thousand moving parts that come together to harm you.
Decades ago, trained pilots could control aircraft with only two movable parts: a propeller and a rudder.
Recently, we discovered that flying with just one part works.
This is the monoplane, the mechanically simplest remotely controlled flying device. It was recently invented.
It has only one movable part, a propeller,
no flaps, hinges, and rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, just one propeller.
Although it is mechanically simple, a lot happens internally for it to fly stably and move anywhere in space.
Despite this, it doesn't have the elegant algorithm of a rear starter. To get it flying, I have to throw it just right.
The probability of throwing it just right when everyone is watching is low, hence I am showing you a video that was filmed last night.
If the monoplane is a lesson in frugance, then this machine here, the omnicopter with its eight propellers, is a lesson in excess.
What do we do with all this excess?
You see that it is extremely symmetric.
That's why he is ambivalent in his orientation.
Through this, he gains the extraordinarily special ability,
move in all directions in space, regardless of which direction it is turned or even how it is rotated.
Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive flows from the eight propellers.
Some aspects can be depicted in models, the rest is is learned directly while flying.
Let's look at this.
When drones are to become part of our daily lives, they must become extremely safe and reliable.
This machine here consists of two separate two-propeller drones.
This rotates clockwise.
and the other counter-clockwise.
When they are assembled together, they behave like a high-performance quadcopter.
However, if something goes wrong - a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or battery - the machine can still fly, albeit restricted.
We will now demonstrate this by rendering half of it flightless.
The final demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.
The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows for a range of aesthetic expression.
We used commercially available Micro-Quadcopters each weighing less than a slice of bread, and equipped them with localization technology and algorithms.
Each unit knows its position in space and is self-driven. That's why there is no upper limit.
Hopefully, these demonstrations inspire you to come up with new revolutionary ideas.
The particularly safe machine over there wants to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.
Of course, it's difficult to predict the impact of this technology beforehand.
For people like us, the reward lies in the development and the creative act.
It serves as a reminder of how wonderfully and enchantingly our universe is, and that it allows creative, wise beings to shape it in such spectacular ways.
The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the cherry on top of the icing.
Thank you.
