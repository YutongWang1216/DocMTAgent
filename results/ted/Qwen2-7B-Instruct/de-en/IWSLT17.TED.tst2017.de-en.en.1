[On April 3, 2016, the largest data leak in history was published.] [The "Panama Papers" reveal that wealthy and powerful individuals] [have hidden enormous amounts of money in tax havens.] [What does this mean?] [We asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week, we were informed about a leak of 11 million documents from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.
The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secretive world of tax havens.
We get a sense of how clients, banks, and lawyers approach firms like Mossack Fonseca and say: "Okay, we need a secretive company. Can you set that up?"
We do actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, how it operates.
This has already led to first very direct consequences.
The Prime Minister of the island has resigned.
There are also reports that a confidant of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has company postbox firms in tax havens.
It is claimed that a trail of $2 billion USD leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, through a close childhood friend, a famous cellist.
Now there will be many richer people out there and others who will be nervous waiting for the next publication and the next revealed documents.
Now, it sounds like the plot of an espionage thriller or a John Grisham novel.
It seems to cry far away from you, to me, ordinary people.
Why should this concern us?
But the truth is: If the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services like healthcare, education, roads.
And it concerns all of us.
For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.
Media and leading politicians worldwide are discussing how certain secret tax havens are used by a few to hide and obfuscate their wealth - something we've been discussing and revealing for ten years.
I think that many people find this whole world very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.
I always imagine it as a nesting doll.
So one has a company within another company, within yet another company, making it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these facades.
It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society, to really understand what is going on.
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US.
Probably, because so far no prominent Americans have appeared in these revelations, this scandal.
Now it's not true that there are no wealthy Americans hiding their wealth in tax havens countries.
However, due to the principle on which these tax havenss operate, Mossack Fonseca had fewer American clients.
If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming, or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples with connections to the USA.
Indeed, it's true that in some US states, one needs less information, or has to provide less information, to set up a company than to get a library card.
This kind of opacity in the US has allowed school district employees to defraud students.
It has allowed fraudsters to prey on, particularly vulnerable investors.
This kind of behavior affects us all.
Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all of this looked in practice.
How does that actually work?
Also we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.
Our investigator pretended to be an African minister bringing suspicious funds to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.
It really shocked us that everyone except one lawyer made suggestions on how our investigator could transfer his money.
These were all pre-meetings. None of these lawyers took us on as clients, and of course, no money was given to anyone. But it shows the problem with this system.
It is also important not to view this as individual cases.
It's not about a single lawyer who has been making suggestions to our covert investigator.
It's not about a single high-profile politician embroiled in a scandal.
It's about how the system works to perpetuate corruption, tax evasion, poverty, and instability.
And to address this, we must change the rules.
We must change the rules to make such behavior harder.
That might all sound rather gloomy, as though there's nothing we could do about it; as though nothing has ever changed; as though there will always be the rich and the powerful.
But as a born optimist, I do see that quite a bit has started to change.
In the last few years, we have seen advances towards more transparency, particularly concerning company owners.
The topic gained political attention at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013, led by British Prime Minister David Cameron.
Since then, the EU has been capturing on national levels in central registers who really lies behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.
One of the unpleasant facts is that the US lags behind in this regard.
Representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in both parliamentary chambers, yet this does not make the progress we would like to see.
We would really like to see how these Panama disclosures, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, can be used as a tool to promote more transparency in the USA and globally.
For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.
We need ordinary people who become furious when they see others hide their true identities behind shell companies.
We need business leaders who stand up and say: "Lack of transparency is not good for business."
We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and work to end this kind of lack of transparency through laws.
Together, we can finally put an end to the opacity that currently enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption, and money laundering.
