"What do you think when you look at me?"
"A believer? An expert?"
"Perhaps even a sister."
"Or suppressed, under brainwashing, a terrorist?"
"Or simply a delay during security check at the airport."
"ThisThis is actually true."
"I am not blaming you for your negative impressions."
"So do the media portray people who look like me."
"A study found that 80% of the reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative."
Studies show that Americans believe most would not know any Muslims.
Probably people don't speak with their Uber drivers.
"For all those who have never met a Muslim: It's great to get to know you."
"I tell you who I am."
"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with extra cream."
"I am introverted,"
"a wannabe fitness fanatic,"
"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim woman."
"But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born like that."
"I have decided to do so."
"When I was 17 years old, I made the decision to come out."
"NoNo, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim woman. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head covering."
My feminist friends were horrified: "Why are you suppressing yourself?"
The funny thing was: at the time, it was my feminist declaration of independence, against the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old to conform to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.
I did not merely passively adopt the faith of my parents.
I've struggled with the Quran.
I read it, thought about it, questioned it, doubted it, and ultimately believed.
My relationship with God was not love at first sight.
She was trust and slow surrender, deepening with each reading of the Quran.
The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.
I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.
Have you ever felt that someone perceives you, fully understands you, yet somehow loves you?
It feels like this.
Later, I got married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.
"I had a child later, after my marriage, and lived essentially the 'Egyptian-American dream'."
Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.
Many of you probably remember exactly where you were.
I was sitting in my kitchen, had just finished breakfast, looked at the screen, and saw the word "urgent news".
There was smoke, planes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.
"What was?"
An accident?
"A technical malfunction?"
My shock turned quickly into indignation.
Why should one do such a thing?
I switched the TV channel and heard: "... Muslim terrorist(s)...", "... in the name of Islam...","... of Near Eastern descent...", "...Jihad...","... bombed Mecca!"
Oh, my God.
It wasn't not just my country that was attacked, but within moments, the actions of others transformed me from a citizen into a suspect.
On the same day, we had to drive through the central west of the USA to move into a new city and start our rebuilding studies.
I remember how, as we drove silently, I sank as low as I could into my seat, and for the first time I feared being recognized as a Muslim.
We moved into our apartment that night in a new city that felt like a completely different world.
And then, I heard, saw, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations, which said: "Be vigilant", "Be cautious", "Stay in well-lit areas", "Gather not".
I stayed inside the whole week.
Then it was Friday that week -- the day Muslims gather for prayer.
And again the warnings were: "Do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a target."
I looked through the extensive reporting.
The feelings were naturally unfiltered, and I also heard about attacks on Muslims or people mistaken for Muslims being dragged outside and beaten.
There were really arson attacks on mosques.
I thought: We should stay at home.
But something didn't feel right.
Because the people who attacked this country had attacked our country.
I have taken the anger of the people towards the terrorists.
Imagine! I was also angry.
It's not easy to constantly have to explain oneself.
I have nothing against questions, I love questions.
The accusations are the hard ones.
Today, we can actually hear people say: "There is is a problem in this country -- it's called Muslims."
"When are we going to get rid of them?"
Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.
They speak of my community as if it were a tumor in the body of the USA.
The only question is: Are we evil or good?
You know: a malignant tumor is one removes entirely and a benign tumor one only monitors.
The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrongly formulated.
Muslims are, like all other Americans, not a tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.
Thank you!
Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic athletes.
Will closing mosques make America safer?
It might perhaps keep a few parking spaces free, but it won't stop the terror.
Regular mosque attendance leads to a more tolerant view of people of other faithss and greater civic participation.
And as a police officer in the area of Washington, DC recently told me: People are actually not radicalized in mosques.
They will be radicalizeded in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.
During the radicalization process, it has been observed that it starts online. Firstly, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, allowing the extremist group to brainwash them. This leads the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who disapproves of their behavior and ideology is a traitor or has fallen away from the faith.
If we want to prevent radicalization, we need to encourage people to attend the mosque.
Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.
Finally, a group like ISIS justifies their brutality with the Quran.
As a Muslim woman, as a mother, as a human being, I believe we must do everything to stop a group like ISIS.
But we would be caving into their worldview if we accepted them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.
Thank you!
ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan does with Christianity.
Both groups claim that their ideology's foundations lie in their "Holy Book".
But if one looks at them, it doesn't urge them to read her "Holy Book".
It's their brutality that allows them to interpret these things into their Holy Book.
A prominent Imam recently told me an amazing story.
A girl came to him because she intended to join ISIS.
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.
He said, the problem was exactly the opposite. Every clergyman she had spoken to had silenced her and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only get her into trouble.
Inspired by nothing and something that gave meaning to her anger, she was a prime target for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.
This Imam helped to reconnect her with God and her community.
Instead of blaming her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.
What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining ISIS.
That was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.
But how does it affect ordinary Americans?
How does it affect everyone else?
How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy, our freedom of thought every day?
A study - actually more several neuroscientific studies - show: when we fear, at least three things happen.
We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity, and prejudices.
A study shows: When presenting test subjects news where negatively about Muslims, they tend to justify military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the restriction of rights of American Muslims.
This is not just an academic issue.
When you look at when the sentiment against Muslims spiked -- between 2001 and 2an13 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.
It occurred before the Iraq War and during two election periods.
So, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terrorism, as I had expected.
It can indeed be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has sensible and well-informed citizens.
Dealinging with Muslims is an early warning sign.
We might feel it first, but the toxic air of fear does harm us all.
Assigning collective guilt is is not just about having to justify oneself.
Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both had attended school.
Deah was an athlete.
He was talented and promising at the dental faculty...
His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.
She visited him there and he showed her his resume. She was surprised and said,
"When did my little brother become such a knowledgeable young man?"
Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, killed her in their apartment, just like Razan, Yusor's sister, who had visited in the afternoon. He did it during what resembled a execution, after he had posted anti-Muslim statements on his Facebook page.
He shot Deah eight times.
Fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also deadly.
So back to the beginning.
What happened after the 9/11 attacks?
Did we go to the mosque or stay safe at home?
We discussed it and for us, it was no easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can practice our religion freely.
We decided to go to the mosque.
With our son in the child seat, we drove silently, under pressure, to the mosque.
I took him out, removed my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and when I saw, I let myself be stopped.
The hall was full to the brim.
Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked everyone, and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers, and non-believers, who came here not to attack us, but to support us.
In this moment, I collapsed.
These people were there because they preferred courage and compassion over panic and prejudices.
What will you choose?
What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?
Will you ensure safety on number?
Or will you join those who say: We are better than them.
Thank you.
Thank you!
Helen Walters: So Dalia, it seems like you've hit a nerve.
But I wonder what you would say to those who might claim that you deliver a TED Talk, that you're a thinker with depth working in a noble think tank, thus being an exception and not the norm.
What would you say to those people?
Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't mistake me. I am completely normal.
I am not an exception.
My story is not extraordinary.
I am as ordinary as it allows.
When one looks at Muslims around the world, and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims worldwide, people want normal things.
They want prosperity for the family, they want work, and they want to live in peace.
I am in no way an exception.
When people seem like an exception, it often means that the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.
HW: Thank you. Dalia Mogahed.
