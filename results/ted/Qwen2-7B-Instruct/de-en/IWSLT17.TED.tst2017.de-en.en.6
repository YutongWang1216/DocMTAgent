Recently, I tried an experiment.
For a year, I would say "Yes!" to everything that scared me.
Regardless of whether it made me nervous, led me into uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say "yes".
Did I want to speak in public?
No, but yes!
Did I want to be live on TV?
No, but yes!
Did I want to start acting?
No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.
And a crazy thing happened - doing exactly what I was afraid of, got rid of my fear.
My fear of speaking, of social anxiety - poof, gone.
The power of a word is impressive.
"Yes" has changed my life.
"Yes" has changed me.
But there was was a specific 'yes', which profoundly changed my life in an unexpected way. It started with a question from my youngest.
I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett, and Emerson. And Emerson, the youngest, for inexplicable reasons, calls everyone "sweetheart".
as if she were a Southern waitress.
"Sweetheart, I need milk for my birdie cup."
She once asked me if I could play with her when I was just about to jump. And I said: "Yes".
This 'yes' was the beginning.
A new lease on life in my family. From then on, I vowed to always play with them whenever they asked. Regardless of what I'm doing, or where I am, I always say yes - every single time.
Almost. I'm not perfect, but I strive very much.
It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.
But it also has a surprising side effect effect: Only recently did I fully understand that saying "yes" to playing with my children actually saved my career.
I have a dream job.
I am the author. I come up with ideas, bringing them to life.
Dream job.
No.
I am a titan.
Dream job.
I create television. I produce television.
I make television, in grand style.
In this TV season, it is my responsibility to bring 70 hours of programming into the world.
Four television programs, 70 hours of television. Three to four shows productions are happening simultaneously.
Each show offers hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.
The budget for an episode of a television series can range between three and six million dollars.
Let's say five.
A new episode every nine days for four shows productions, so every nine days 20 million dollars worth of television, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows productions happening simultaneously, multiplied by four, 16 episodes at once: 24 episodes of Grey's, 21 episodes of Scandal, 15 episodes of How To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes of The Catch, 70 hours of television.
350 million dollars for a season.
In America, my TV series air one after another on Thursday nights.
My series air worldwide in 256 regions across 63 languages for 33 million viewers.
My mind is global, and out of these 60 TV hours, 44 are showsings of programs that I've personally created, not just produced. So, I still need to find time for truly quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.
Four television series, 77 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows productions at the same time, $351 million, campfires burning around the world.
Do you know who it's done?
No one, that's why I am a titan.
Dream job.
I do not want to impress you with this.
I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.
I tell you this, so that all of you, whether you run a company, a country, or a classroom; manage a business or a household, take me seriously when I talk about work. So that you understand that I'm not just mindlessly typing on a computer and fantasizing. And it is true when I say: I understand that a dream job is not just about dreaming.
It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat - no tears.
I work a lot, hard, and I love it.
When I am deeply engrossed in the work, there is no other feeling.
My work always creates a country out of nothing.
It's as if I were deploying troops, or painting on a canvas.
So as to run a marathon, one would have to maintain a high pace.
One feels like Beyoncé.
And all that at the same time.
I love to work.
She is creative, mechanical, demanding and exhilarating, funny and disturbing, clinical and nurturing, cruel and reasonable. And the best part is the humming.
There's such a change in me when the work is going well.
A buzzing starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a lively street, I could drive on it forever.
Many people assume, when I explain to them about the humming, that I'm talking about writing, that it gives me pleasure.
Don't misunderstand me, she do them.
But the humming -- when I started with TV production, when I began working and working and making things, building up, creating and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this humming, this energy. The humming!
The humming is more than the writing.
The buzzing is action and activity. The buzzing is a drug.
The buzzing is music. The buzzing is light and air.
The buzzing is God's voice in my ear.
And if you have such a buzzing, then you cannot help but aim for greatness.
The feeling of not being able to do anything other than strive for greatness, regardless of the cost.
That's what they call the buzzing.
Or perhaps it means being a workaholic.
Perhaps it means being a genius.
Perhaps it means Ego.
Perhaps it's the fear of failure.
I don't know.
I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the humming.
I just want to say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I do not want to question that.
To clarify: The more successful I become, the more episodes, the more overcome boundaries, the more work there is, the more things happening simultaneously, the more people watching observing me, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.
The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.
And what did I say about work?
I love work, right?
The land I create, the marathon I run, the army on the canvas, the high pitch, the humming, the humming, the humming.
I enjoy this humming. I love the humming.
I need the humming. I am the humming.
Am I just this humming?
And then the humming stopped.
Overworked, overstressed, overdone, burnt out.
The humming stopped.
Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mother is a single working titan.
Harper tells people: "My mom won't be here, but you can write to my nanny."
And Emerson says: "Honey, I want to go to Shonda-Land."
They are the children of a titan.
You are Baby Titans.
They were 12, 3, and 1 when the buzzing stopped.
The hum of the motor ceased.
I no longer loved my work. The engine was out.
The buzzing did not return back.
My humming was broken.
I did the same things as always: the same Titan's work, 15-hour days, overworked weekends, no rest, nothing delegated, a Titan doesn't sleep, doesn't give up, wholeheartedly, clearly-eyed, all the time.
But there was no buzzing.
In me was silence.
Four television programs, 67 hours, three productions at once, sometimes four.
Four television programs, 67 hours, three productions at once ...
I was the perfect Titan.
I was a model Titan,
Everything was gray, I just didn't have any fun anymore.
And that was my life.
Everything, what I did.
I was the buzzing and the buzzing was I.
What do you do when what you're doing, the work you're pursuing, suddenly fades away?
I know, some might think: "Get over yourself, stupid author Titan."
But you know, you do it, you make it happen, you work at it, you love it, just like being a teacher, a banker, a mother, an artist, being Bill Gates, you just love doing something else and that gives you the buzz. If you know the buzz, and how it feels, if you've experienced the buzz before, when the buzz stops, who are you then?
Who are you?
Who am I?
Am I still a Titan?
If the song of my heart stops, can I survive in the silence?
And then my "Südstaaten-Kellnerin" asks me a question.
I am heading outside, late and she says: "Mom, do you want to play?"
And I would already say No, when two things become apparent to me.
Firstly, I have to say Yes to everything, and secondly, she didn't call me "Honey".
She no longer calls anyone "Honey".
When did this happen?
I miss being a Titan and indulging in my buzzing, and everything changes right of my own eyes.
"And so she says: "Mom, do you want to play?"
"And I say: 'Yes'."
There is nothing special about it.
"We play and her sisters join in, we laugh a lot, and I read dramatically from the book 'Everybody Poops'."
Nothing extraordinary.
But it's remarkable because in the solitude and absence of the buzzing, my pain and panic, I can do nothing except to take care.
I am focused.
I am focused.
The land I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high pitch - they no longer exist.
Everything that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons, and the song about letting go, or whatever the girl in "Frozen" lets go.
Everywhere is peace and simplicity.
The air in this place is so thin that I barely can breathe.
I can hardly believe that I am breathing.
Playing is the opposite of working.
"And I am happy."
Something inside me dissolves.
A mental door opens and an energy surge comes in.
"And not immediately, but it happens, it does happen."
I feel it.
The buzzing is slowly coming back.
No full volume, barely there, it's subtle, barely audible, but it's there.
Not the buzzing, but a buzzing.
And now I feel as though I know a magical secret.
"But let's stay on track."
It's love. That's all.
No magic. No secret. Just love.
It's something we've forgotten.
The buzzing, the work buzzing, the titan buzzing, that's just the replacement.
When I ask you who you are, when I tell you who I am, when I describe myself using showsings and TV hours and how proficient my brain functions, then I have forgotten what the actual buzzing is.
The buzzing is not a force and it is not work-specific.
It is dependent on freedom.
The real buzzing is dependent on love.
The buzzing is is the stream from the zest for life.
The real buzzing is is self-confidence and peace.
The real buzzing ignores the pressure of history, the mundane tasks, expectations, and pressure.
The real buzzing is simple and original.
The real buzzing is God's's voice in my ear, but maybe God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me that I am a Titan?
It's simply just love.
We all need a bit more love, a lot more love.
As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.
I make this a firm rule so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.
It's law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice, if I want to hear the buzzing again.
I wish it were that simple. I'm not good at playing, I don't like it.
Playing doesn't appeal to me at all, like working.
The truth hurts,
but I don't like to play.
I work always because I love it.
I would rather be at work than at home.
This admission is painful, because for a person would rather work than be at home?
Well, me.
Frankly, I call myself "Titan" --
I must be having problems.
That I'm too relaxed is none of that.
We run around the garden back and forth, up and down.
We have little dance parties,
We sing and play ball.
We pop the soap bubbles.
During this, I mostly feel stiff, absent-minded, and confused.
I always reach out for my phone.
But it's okay.
My children show me how to live, and the 'summing' of the universe fills me.
I play and play until I wonder: Why did we ever stop playing?
They can do it too! Say yes every time your child wants to play with you.
Perhaps you see me as naive, as a dreamer.
You're probably right there, but you can do it too!
You have time!
And do you know why? You're not Rihanna or a Muppet-show character.
Your child finds you less interesting than you think.
It's just 15 minutes.
My kids want to play with me for at most 15 minutes before they remember they want to do something else.
These are wonderful 15 minutes, but they are just 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, a ladybug or cookie replaces me.
And if my teenage daughter talks to me for the whole 15 minutes, I'm the Mother of the Year.
It's just 15 minutes, no more is needed.
Everyone can find 15 minutes straight, even on a bad mood day!
Straight for 15 minutes!
No phone, no laundry, no distractions.
The day is short: dinner, getting the kids ready for bed.
But those 15 minutes are there!
My children are my oasis of well-being, my world. It doesn't have to be the children. It's about feeling the 'summing', having a place for one's soul peace.
It's not about playing with one's own children. It's about joy,
about "playinging" in general.
Treasure the 15 minutes!
Find out what helps you.
Find out and keep it for yourself.
I'm not perfect at it. I stumble and I triumph. Meeting friends, reading books, enjoy the day --
"Want to play?" encapsulates everything I gave up when I got my first TV show, when I became a Titan in training, when I increasingly wanted to surpass myself.
Why not indulge in full 15 minutes straight?
What could possibly be wrong? Nothing!
The buzzing came back in my free time. The buzzing then seems to return when I'm not working.
Working doesn't function without playing.
It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens, energy flows in, and I find myself back in my office. I hear an unfamiliar melody, it fills me and my soul. It leads me to new ideas. The buzzing has found its way back. I fully utilize it and love my work again.
I like the buzzing, but I don't love it.
I don't need it.
I am not the buzzing, buzzing is not me... no longer.
Foam bubbles and sticky fingers, evening meal with friends.
This is now my buzzing.
The buzzing of life.
The buzzing of love.
The buzzing of work is a part of me, but just one part. And for that, I am so grateful.
It doesn't bother me that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan play a journey to Jerusalem.
I said yes to less work and more playing.
And yet, I have everything under control. My brain still functions. My campfires are still burning.
The more I play, the happier I and my children become.
The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.
The more I play, the clearer my head becomes.
The more I play, the better I work.
The more I play, the more I hear the buzzing. The land I create, the marathon I run, the troops, the canvases, the high tone, the buzzing, the buzzing, the other, the right buzzing: the buzzing of life.
The more I feel this buzzing, the more this unusual, trembling, naked and new feeling of life spreads within me. Less Titan - more me!
The more I feel exactly this buzzing, the more I know who I am.
I am the author. I think things up, I bring them to life.
This is part of the job, meaning living one's dream.
This is the dream of this job,
because a dream job should be a little dreamy.
I said "yes" to less work and more playing.
Titans don't stand a chance here.
"Do you want to play?"
Thank you very much.
