Most haven't heard of Roy Price, although he's probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.
Most likely also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.
This goes back to the decision Roy made three years ago.
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,
the TV production company of Amazon.
He is 42 years old, fit, has a spiky hairdo, and describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, tech, tacos".
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce.
Of course, this is a very fiercely contested industry.
There are already so many TV series that Roy can't just pick any one.
He has to find shows concepts that are extremely good.
In other words, he has to find shows concepts that are at the very top of this curve.
This curve represents the distribution of over 2500 TV series' ratings on the website IMDB. The rating ranges from 1 to 10, and the height indicates how many shows received this rating.
If your show is rated nine or higher, it's a winner.
Then one has a successful show.
These are shows like "Breaking Bad", "Game of Thrones", "The Wire" - all the shows that make you addicted, where after watching a season, your mind asks: "Where can I find more of these episodes?"
This kind of show.
On the left side, at this end, there are shows like "Toddller and Tiaras" -- this should give you enough indication of where they are on this curve's end.
Roy Price doesn't worry about getting to the wrong side of the curve because I believe one needs special intelligence to underestimate "Toddler and Tiara".
He worries more about the middle bulge, the average TV - the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't excite him.
So he has to make sure that he is really on the right side.
The pressure is present, and of course, it is also the first time for Amazon to do something like this, therefore, Roy Price wants to avoid taking any risks.
He wants to create successes.
He needs guaranteed success, so he initiates a competition.
He considers numerous ideas for TV shows concepts, selects eight candidates through an evaluation, then produces the first episode of each of these shows, and uploads them online where anyone can watch them for free.
And if Amazon gives things away for free, don't people just take advantage of that, right?
Millions of viewers watch these episodes.
However, they do not know that they are being watched while viewing these shows.
They are being watched by Roy and his team, who capture everything.
They track when the show starts, when breaks are taken, which parts are skipped or replayed.
They gather millions of data points to then make decisions on which show to produce.
In fact, they gather the data, process these, and from this, the answer emerges, and it goes like this: "Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican US senators."
They made this show.
Does anyone know the name of this show?
Yes, "Alpha House", but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't not that good.
It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 3.4, and Alpha House lands at 3.4 -- so slightly above the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team were aiming for.
Around the same time at another company, another manager placed a top show using data analysis. His name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the programming manager at Netflix. Just like Roy, he's always on the hunt for that one super show and uses data for it, but he does it a bit differently.
Instead of organizing a competition, he and his team reviewed looked at the existing data about Netflix viewers, namely the ratings they give to shows, the course the shows progresses, which shows they like, etc.
Then they use these data to uncover these small details about the viewers: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.
When they had all the parts, they took a risk and decided to make a drama series about a senator instead of a sitcom about four senators.
Do you know this show?
Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix hit a home run with it, at least for the first two seasons.
"House of Cards" receives a 9.1 rating on this curve. So precisely where they wanted to go.
Of course, the question now is: What happened here?
Two very competitive, data-savvy companies have been mentioned.
They combine these many data points and it works superbly for one of them, but not for the other company.
What is it based on?
Because the logic somehow suggests that it should work everywhere.
When you collect millions of data points for a decision, then you should be able to make a good decision.
One has 200 years of statistics as backup.
One optimizes it through very capable computers.
The bare minimum one can expect is good television, or?
If data analysis doesn't work, then that's somewhat alarming, because we live in a time where we increasingly rely on statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond just television.
Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems here?
No one. Okay, that's even good.
Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. If you do come into contact with it, you'll end up in prison.
If someone here in the USA is in prison and requests release, it's likely that the data analysis of this company will be used to determine whether a release will take place or not.
Just like at Amazon and Netflix. But instead of deciding if a show will will be good or bad, it's decided if a person will be good or bad.
Average television, 22 minutes, that can really be bad, but more years in prison are even worse.
Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite all the data,
Not always the best results. This is not due to a company like Multi-Health Systems not knowing how to use data.
Even the most data-savvy companies can sometimes get it wrong.
Yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes.
In 2009, Google announced that they could predict outbreaks of severe flu through data analysis of Google searches.
It worked perfectly and was a big news sensation. The success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature".
It worked flawlessly, year after year, until suddenly it no longer worked.
And nobody could say why.
It simply didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the retraction of the publication in the magazine "Nature".
Even data-savvy companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.
Despite all these mistakes, data is flowing increasingly into decision-making in life - at the workplace, in the enforcement of law, in medicine.
Also, let's rather ensure that data is helpful.
Even I have many issues with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics - an area where some very smart people use unbelievably large amounts of data to make serious decisions, such as choosing cancer treatments.
or the development of a medication. Over the years, I've recognized some patterns regarding the difference between successful decisions based on data and unsuccessful ones. This pattern should be disseminated.
If you ever need to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things.
Firstly, break this problem down into its components so that you can analyze each part; secondly, put the parts back together to make a decision.
Sometimes you have to do this multiple times, but there are always two things: breaking apart and putting together again.
And now the most important thing: Data and data analysis are only good for the first part.
Data and data analysis, regardless of how powerful, can only help in breaking down a problem and understanding its parts.
They are not suited to put the pieces together again and then come to a decision.
For this, there is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.
When it comes to something, the brain excels at putting pieces and parts back together, even with incomplete information, to make a good decision - particularly when it's the brain of an expert.
That's why, I believe, Netflix was so successful, because they used data and intelligence where they also belong in the process.
They use data to better understand their audience, something they would otherwise not be capable of. But the decision on how to take all these pieces, put them back together, and create a show like "House of Cards", that cannot be found in the data.
Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, meaning they took a significant large personal risk with this decision.
Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.
They used data to steer all their decisions, first when they competed for TV ideas, then when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.
It was a safe decision, because they could always say: "That's what the data tells us."
It did not lead to the desired result.
Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things start going wrong when data begins to steer our decisions.
Regardless of how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to remember this, this device is quite useful.
Many of you will...
Before there were data, this was the device for decisions.
Many know it.
It's also called the "Magic 8 Ball". It's astonishing. For decisions using a yes or no question, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "Most likely" - precisely in this moment.
I will fight it out with a technology demo later.
I have made several decisions in my life so far, where I should have listened to the ball afterwards.
"But, as you naturally know, when you have the data available, you would like to replace something much more sophisticated with data analysis, in order to make better decisions."
But this does not change the foundational structure.
Perhaps the ball will become smarter and smarter and smarter. Ultimately, it lies in our hands to make decisions if we want to reach up to something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.
And I find this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data, it still pays off to make decisions, being an expert in doing so, and taking risks.
Because at the end of the day, it's not the data, but the risks, that you end up facing at the right end of the curve.
Thank you.
