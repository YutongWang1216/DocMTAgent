"At university, since I specialized in politics, I had to write a lot of reports."
"It would be something like this distribution of workload when a regular student writes a report."
"When you do it this way - starting slowly but thoroughly in the first week, then even if the latter half becomes somewhat high in load, an orderly state is maintained."
"I myself would also want to do it that way."
"Plan-wise,"
"I intend to start right away, but in reality when it comes to doing the report, it ends up happening like this in my case."
"It always ends up like this."
"After that, I have to write a 90-page thesis. It's something that should be written over the course of a year."
"I knew that the usual way wouldn't work."
"The scale is too large."
"So I made plans to proceed in this manner."
"It's a plan for a year."
"It starts off lightly, rises slightly in the middle, and then accelerates towards the end, similar to climbing a gentle staircase."
"Going up this staircase is"
"It shouldn't not be difficult."
However, something strange happened.
The first few months were...
"It was passed, but nothing could be done."
Therefore, the plan will be changed accordingly.
"After that - the middle period also passed, but I couldn't write, resulting in this situation."
"Furthermore, two months turn into one month, and that becomes two weeks."
"Waking up one morning, there were only three days left until the deadline. Not having written a single word yet, there was was no choice but. Suddenly, the task became to write a 90-page paper within 7 hours. I stayed up for two nights continuously. Humans aren't not built to do things like that. But I raced through the campus, time slowed down, and submitted just before the deadline."
I thought that was was was all over.
A call came one week later, from the university.
"Is it Tim Urban?"
"Yes",
"Regarding the submitted thesis, there is something to discuss."
"Ah"
"The thing I was told was 'I have never seen such a wonderful thesis.'"
Nothing like that happened.
It was a terribly bad paper.
"I just wanted everyone to think, 'This person is a genius,' for even a moment."
It is a terribly bad paper.
Currently, I am engaged in writing.
I write a blog called 'Wait But Why'.
I decided to write about "procrastination" about two years ago.
My behavior always confused those around me, so I wonder what's going on inside the mind of a procrastinator and why we act this way.
I wanted to explain it to people who are not procrastinators. I believe there must be differences between the brains of procrastinators and those who aren't not.
To verify this, I found out a place that could provide me with an MRI scan of my brain and a non-procrastinator's brain, and decided to compare them.
This result is what I've brought here today.
I think you should pay attention to see if there are differences.
Even though I'm not an expert in the brain, there might be subtle differences that are hard to understand. Anyway, please take a look.
This is the brain of someone who is not a procrastinator.
[Reason-based decision makers] In contrast,
"My brain here —"
[Someone who wants immediate rewards like a greedy monkey] This is the difference between the two.
Both brains have a 'reason-based decision maker,' but however in the procrastinator's brain, in addition to that, there is a 'greedy monkey wanting immediate rewards.'
How does that relate to procrastination?
Everything was smoothly until it doesn't.
"The better reason-based decision-maker thinks, 'I should do a bit more work,' but 'nope.' The reason-based decision-maker makes a rational decision to do something productive, but the greedy monkey doesn't like that. So, it takes the steering wheel and says, 'You know what, let's read the Wikipedia article about the Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding incident. I just remembered that.'"
Then - I need to check the fridge to see if anything has changed since ten minutes ago.
Afterwards, there's a YouTube spiral waiting. It starts with a video where Richard Feyn talks about magnets and goes all the way to an interview with Justin Bieber's mom much later.
So I'll be busy for a while, so sorry, but today's all.
"There's no room for leisure in work, you know."
"What is happening?"
Greedy monkeys are not the ones you want to take the lead.
Living only in this moment.
Considering nothing else but just two things, they being easy and enjoyable activities, even with no past memories or knowledge about the future.
In the animal world, that would be fine.
If it were a dog, living by doing only easy and enjoyable things would be a huge success.
For the greedy monkey, humans are also just another species of animal.
"EEat well, sleep well, and just produce the next generation. Perhaps it was would have been alright during primitive life, but..."
We are not living in a primitive life anymore.
Despite living in our advanced civilization, the greedy monkey doesn't't understand what this means.
That's why another 'reason-based decision-maker' also exists in the brain, providing them with abilities that other animals don't have.
We imagine the future.
The ability to see the big picture.
Establishing long-term plans.
The rational decision-maker considers everything.
"I am going to make myself do what I should be doing."
Engaging in easy and enjoyable activities is alignss with reason at times, such as during dinner, when sleeping, or during leisure time.
There are overlapping parts between the two.
There are times when opinions align.
However, making difficult but not particularly enjoyable judgments in the interest of overall considerations can also be reasonable.
"When such situations occur, conflicts arise."
In the case of procrastinators, this conflict tends to always result in a situation where most of the time is spent on the orange section, making it unreasonable, easy, and enjoyable.
I refer to this area as 'Playground of Darkness'.
The Playground of Darkness is - a place that all procrastinators are familiar with.
It's a place where you end up playing when it's not the time to be playing.
The joys found that one experiences in the Playground of Darkness actually aren't not enjoyable. They're unwarranted pleasures filled with guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-loathing - all the familiar feelings associated with procrastination.
The issue lies in how the greedy monkey, in control of the situation, enables the procrastinator to move from the blue area, where comfort is subpar but truly important things occur, to a place of action.
Actually, procrastinators have guardian angels who always watch over them, even at the worst times; these are also referred to as the 'Panic Monster'.
The Panic Monster: The Panic Monster usually sleeps most of the time, but when there's a looming deadline, a loss of face, or an occupational crisis with a scary impending conclusion, it suddenly wakes up.
The important thing is that it's the only thing the greedy monkey fears.
Recently, I found found had to deal with this. Six months ago, people from TED contacted me and invited me to give a TED talk.
Of course, I answered "I will do it."
The goal was to be able to say that I gave a TED talk in the past, which has been a lifelong dream of mine.
[Have given a TED talk before] Amidst this excitement, the rational decision-maker is preoccupied with something else.
"Are you aware of what you've taken on?"
Do you know what will wake you up someday?
"Get focused right now! Don't procrastinate!"
The monkey would reply, "I'm totally for it, but let's open Google Earth, zoom in to 61 meters above the southern tip of India, scroll for about 2.5 hours, and then we might be able to get a good grasp of the image of India."
So, on that day, I kept doing that.
Six months turned into four months, then two months, and finally one month. TED published the list of speakers.
When I opened that page, my own face looking back at me was was there.
So, who woke up?
The Panic Monster became frantic, and soon the entire system was thrown into chaos.
Remember that the monkey fears the Panic Monster, so it will escape to the tree.
With this, the rational will-maker was finally able to take the helm, and I began preparing for the lecture.
The actions resulting from procrastination under the influence of the Panic Monster can also be explained. There have been instances where, despite having two weeks to write the first line of a report, one found'ts manage to write even that. This sudden awakening to extremely strong work ethics, working through the night to complete eight pages, is not uncommon either.
This is the overall situation involving three characters, the procrastination system.
It's not pretty, but it ultimately works.
This was what I decided to write on my blog two years ago.
When I wrote it up, I was惊 at the reaction on the blog.
Tens of thousands of emails were sent from all around the world, from a truly diverse array of people.
Nurse, bank clerk, painter, engineer, and a myriad of graduate students.
What everyone was writing about was the same thing, "I also have the same problem".
However, the lightness of the blog post and the weight of the received emails were contrasting.
It was written with strong irritation about the significant impact procrastination has on their life, due to the monkey's.
Looking at it, I thought about how the procrastination system can function, what's happening?
"Why are they in such a bleak state?"
The realization was that there are two types of procrastination.
In my discussed examples, there was a deadline.
"When there's a deadline, the impact of procrastination is limited to a short period, and the Panic Monster appears."
However, there is another type of procrastination where there is no deadline.
In cases of entrepreneurial or artistic work, like those of individual entrepreneurs or artists, there are no deadlines at the beginning. Nothing happens until you go out and do something, getting into a groove and starting to run, because to nothing happens until then.
Furthermore, there are numerous important tasks outside of work that don't have deadlines, such as visiting family, exercising to maintain health, building relationships, or resolving dysfunctional relationships.
If it were the case that procrastinators only had the Panic Monster as the mechanism for doing difficult things, there would be a problem. In situations without deadlines, the Panic Monster wouldn't appear.
Without anything to wake them up, the impact of procrastination is not limited, and it becomes a continuous act of putting things off indefinitely.
Such kinds of long-term procrastination are often overlooked and not talked about much compared to humorous, short-term procrastination with deadlines. They usually attract criticism quietly.
Long-term and significant misfortunes or regrets.
It could be the source, that being the reason why those people wrote the emails, and I thought that was the reason for such terrible circumstances.
It is not as if they're stuck in a project.
Long-term procrastination makes one feel like a bystander in their own life.
Their frustration lies not in not being able to realize dreams, but in not even being able to start chasing them.
There have been times when reading such emails, I've had a thought: there aren't no non-procrastinators.
Everyone is a procrastinator.
"Even for someone like me, who isn't completely insane, you might be able to maintain a healthy relationship with deadlines. But be aware that the problem with the greedy monkey is seems to be most pronounced when there are no deadlines."
Finally, I would like to show you one last thing.
It's the "Life Calendar".
Each box corresponds to a week in a 90-year life.
There aren't not that many, besides, we've been using them quite a bit already.
We all should take our time to look at this calendar.
Everyone, or anyone, is likely procrastinating about something. They are likely wondering what exactly they they are procrastinating about themselves.
You need to be aware of the greedy monkey wanting immediate rewards.
This is our job for all of us.
Considering there aren't not so many boxes, this task should be started today.
Well, even if not today...
If possible,
Before it's too late.
Thank you.
