Have you ever heard of places like Kenema in Sierra Leone or Al-Ara in Nigeria?
That place is the most unique to me.
In that hospital, nurses, doctors, and scientists have quietly fought for years against one of humanity's most fearsome foes - the Lassa virus.
The Lassa virus is similar to the Ebola virus.
It causes high fever, sometimes taking lives.
But they protect us all by putting their lives at risk every day while guarding the people of the community there.
But what surprised me when I visited there years ago was, they would start their extremely harsh daily routine in the front lines every morning by singing songs.
Everyone gathers to express joy.
They show their vitality.
For many years, we visit each other, gather together with everyone, sing, create songs, and it really is enjoyable because we're not just there for the pursuit of science, but we're connected through our human affection.
It can be imagined that it becomes indispensable as something that becomes very important as the situation changes.
In March 2014, it changed significantly; it was when the major outbreak of Ebola was declared in Guinea.
This was the first outbreak in West Africa that occurred near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia in West Africa.
"We are afraid of..."
Actually, for a while, I thought that Lassa and Ebola were spreading more than considered, possibly reaching even Kenema someday.
So my team members immediately took action and joined Dr. Fuma Khan's team. There, they prepared high-sensitivity viral RNA detection devices in anticipation of Ebola crossing the border and reaching Sierra Leone, so that it could be detected.
Since such devices had already been used for Lassa virus对策, the methods were known, and the team was exceptionally proficient.
All they needed is to provide them with the tools to test for Ebola and the place.
However, unfortunately, that day came came.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to the obstetrics ward of a hospital, where the team conducted a test for viral RNA, confirming the first case of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Sierra Leone.
Their work was was extremely commendable.
This case was identified promptly identified, handle the patient safely, and start contact tracing investigation to grasp the situation.
This may have helped to curb the infection spread early on.
However, the outbreak had already been ongoing for several months by that time.
Hundreds of cases occurred, surpassing the previous outbreak.
When it reached Sierra Leone, it wasn't no longer just one case, but like a tsunami, it swept in.
We worked together with international communities, the Ministry of Health, and local government in Kenema to combat this infectious disease. By the following week, we had 31 cases, then 92, and then 147 cases – all patients flowed into Kenema. This is due to the limited facilities available in Sierra Leone to handle this illness.
We have been doing our utmost for 24 hours a day to save the patients, alerting attention, and also performed one more simple task.
The samples of blood taken for Ebola detection, of course course, were naturally disposed of, which was good.
Instead, we inactivated the virus with chemicals, packed the blood samples into boxes, crossed the sea, and sent them to other research facilities.
My team sent it to Boston.
They continued working day and night, conducting shifts, and rapidly analyzed the genomes of 99 Ebola viruses.
The genome of the virus is this blueprint.
The genome is something everyone has.
It embodies all the qualities that constitute us and contains vast amounts of information.
The results of such work are simple yet incredibly powerful.
By observing, comparing, and contrasting these 99 viruses with the three genomes previously released in Guinea, we were able to elucidate that the outbreak started in Guinea months prior. It involved initial human infection followed by transmission from person to person.
This is crucial for understanding how to intervene, but what follows is vital is contact tracing.
As the virus spreads among humans, we confirmed that it is mutating.
Observing each mutation is extremely important because all diagnostic equipment, vaccines, treatment - everything fundamentally relies on genomic sequencing.
International health experts must respond to this, re-adjusting all previous achievements.
At that time, as a scientist, what I did was, first, accumulate data at hand and then spend months locked in the laboratory, carefully and meticulously analyzing the data. This process was repeated several times until the research paper was finally published. And then, the data would be made public.
This is the current flow of scientists' research.
But there was was no way you could have done such a thing?
The friends who were on the front lines clearly needed help, and they needed a lot of help.
So, what we did first was to immediately publish it on the website after the genome sequence was read.
We simply sent out the data to the world and said, "Please lend us your strength."
And the help came.
In an instant, upon seeing that data had been published, I was surprised. Messages started coming in from people all over the world.
A world-renowned virus tracking team suddenly became our ally.
We began to cooperate virtually, continuing phone and email exchanges, tracking and investigating the virus minute by minute, devising methods to halt the spread of infection.
In times of crisis, there are various ways to build a community.
Especially when the outbreak started spreading globally, everyone actively sought to investigate, engage, and lend their strength.
Everyone wanted to be involved.
The abilities of such people all around the world are truly amazing, and the internet connects us all.
Imagine this: instead of avoiding each other as threats, everyone saying "let's do this."
"Let's work together to solve this."
The problem was was that the data we all used was very limited and insufficient because it was just what we searched for on the net.
In such cases, many opportunities and possibilities are lost.
During the early stages of the infectious disease outbreak in Kenema, 106 records were collected. We decided to publish them globally.
And at our institute, we have proven that we can predict the prognosis of Ebola patients with almost 99% accuracy by teaching computers from those 116 cases, which we can then provide to medical professionals working on-site.
We created an app for providing [the service], but however, to fully demonstrate its effectiveness,
In the 116 cases, it wasn't enough, and we were waiting for more data to come in until release.
But the data just wouldn't come.
Everyone was conducting their own research and pondering, waiting, but they weren't all hiling in their silos, not utilizing the power of collaboration.
But such-a, such-a thing couldn't exist, right?
Don't you think so? I reckon you all would think the same.
Our lives are at stake.
Actually, many lives were lost. The healthcare workers colleagues who were so important to me, five of them - Bar Fonnie, Alex Mogboi, Dr. Fuma Khan, Alice Kowoma, and Mohamed Flower.
They were five of the many healthcare professionals who had passed away in and around Kenema. During the time when the world was waiting, we were quietly handling things separately.
Just as with other threats to humanity, Ebola hemorrhagic fever grows due to suspicion and hesitation, discord.
When we build walls between each other and fight, the virus grows stronger.
But unlike other natural threats, the fight against Ebola involves all of us equally.
"We are fighting together."
If one person gets Ebola, it might soon infect someone else.
In this situation, where our lives are similarly fragile, possess the same vitality, and carry the same fears and hopes, I hope we could cooperate and share our joy.
One of the graduate students I supervised read a book about Sierra Leone and discovered that the name of the city where our hospital is located, "Kenema", actually comes from the Krio language spoken in Sierra Leone, meaning "a river so clear that it appears transparent to everyone's eyes".
I felt a profound meaning in it. Before knowing this, we have always respected the people of Kenema, strived to share information in an open environment, and worked together.
"It is something important."
When an outbreak occurs, it is required that we openly share information with ourselves and those around us, in order to fight it together.
This is not the first nor the last major Ebola outbreak. There are still many other microorganisms lurking, such as the Lassa virus, among.
And next, when another pandemic strikes, it could happen in megacities housing millions.
It might be an airborne virus.
"It might be possible for viruses to be intentionally dispersed."
"This is is indeed frightening, as one would expect. But at the same time, what this experience has taught us is that we also possess the technologies and adaptability to overcome it. We can win against viral infections and stand on favorable ground."
But within that, where, we can achieve by working together, let's do so with joy.
In the battle against infectious diseases, like Dr. Khan and those who lost their lives on the front lines, they have always been fighting alongside us. Let's continue this fight together with them.
Let us shine the world with the warmth of billions of hearts and compassion, cooperating to prevent the world from being swayed by a single virus's destruction.
Thank you.
