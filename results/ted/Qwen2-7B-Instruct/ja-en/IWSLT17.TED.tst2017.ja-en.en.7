"I have been longing for the sea since I was a child."
"That is a wonderful place overflowing with colors and life, a habitat for strange creatures akin to aliens."
"I used to imagine a great shark dominating the food chain or a graceful sea turtle swimming through a coral reef."
"I have devoted most of my work to searching for magical places like those I dreamed of when I was a child, after shifting from being an ocean biologist to a photographer."
"I have been exploring underwater quite early on, as you can see."
"But it was when I was around 10 years old that I first really dove underwater."
"I still vividly remember diving strongly, trying to touch an old cannon on a shallow coral."
"And finally grasping it, looking up, I was immediately surrounded by colorful fish. That was was the day I fell in love with the sea."
"Thomas Peschak, a conservation photographer, has had the valuable opportunity over the past 40 years of living on Earth to seek out the magnificent forms of the sea for National Geographic and the Save Our Seas Foundation."
"I have photographed everything, from incredibly large sharks to cute things that can fit in the palm of your hand."
"I encountered a very pungent breath of a humpback whale feeding just 30cm away in the Great Bear Rainforest off the cold Canadian coast."
"I have also been present at the mating grounds of green turtles in the Mozambique Channel."
"Earth and all people on it have influenced each other."
"And the untouched seas that I dreamed of as a child are becoming increasingly difficult to find."
"YouWe are being relentlessly pushed towards a corner."
"We humans have continued to be the primary predators on Earth, but I have been directly witnessing and photographing the growing impact of this."
"I have been thinking for a long time that I should get people's's attention by showing them shocking photos."
"There are advantages to this endeavor, but I have returned to the basics."
"The way to cause change, I thought, is to appeal to love."
"I might be considered one of the pack. As a photographer, I have been fortunate enough to have opportunities to reveal the whole picture of animals and ecosystems hidden beneath the sea surface."
"YouWe cannot cherish or protect something we are unaware of its existence."
"The power of a photo in conservation efforts lies in revealing their hidden forms."
"I have visited hundreds of marine areas, but there are several that particularly struck me."
"The excitement of such experiences was first felt 10 years ago, out in the uncharted coastal waters of rocky South Africa."
"Every June and July, large schools of sardines migrate northward in what is known as the Sardine Run."
"There is a good reason for this."
It's because a quick hunter with an empty stomach is stealthily pursuing at a great speed.
Generally, dolphins hunt in groups, pulling some sardines out of the school to create a bait ball, a spherical group.
"He is driving the fish all the way up to the sea surface to reach this living feast."
"There is a shark right behind me."
"Many people believe that dolphins and sharks are natural enemies, but during sardine runs, they actually coexist."
"Dolphins assist sharks in efficiently hunting for food."
Without dolphins, bait balls would become more dispersed, and sharks would fall into what we call the sardine donut, filling their mouths with water and getting nothing in return.
"Now I understand that during sardine runs, they experience intense moments with sharks, and they do not see me as prey."
However, in this rough party, I bump into or get hit by other fish like them.
"Moving eastward from the African coast, one will eventually come across the Maldive Islands, which are made up of corals, in the vast Indian Ocean."
During the intense southwest monsoon period, numerous Oniitomakii (a type of clam, arrive from all over the islands to a very small area near Honeyfall, a reef ring. They usually come in massive numbers, far exceeding the size of human eyes, and serve as the primary diet for Oniitomakii.
If there are fluctuations in the distribution of phytoplankton, the Oniitomakii will feed alone and repeatedly perform aerial flips, resembling a puppy chasing its own tail.
However, when phytoplankton aggregates in one place, oysters form a line, creating a long chain for feeding. The oyster at the front might occasionally let some plankton slip away, but surely the following oysters will consume it.
As the amount of phytoplankton increases, oysters swim closer to each other. This unique behavior is referred to as cyclone feeding.
Oysters, forming a sturdy chain, spin while becoming multi-level cylinders, swirling plankton into a vortex and guiding it towards their cave-like mouths.
The experience of diving surrounded by hundreds of oysters is truly unforgettable.
When I first photographed Honeyfall, it was not protected and was threatened by development.
Working with NGOs like Manta Trust, my photographs eventually helped Honeyfall become an marine protected area.
Neighboring island fishermen used to catch oysters for making traditional drums out of their shells.
Currently, they are the most active in conservation efforts, and thanks to the oyster, in Morubu, they now earn $8 million more annually.
I always wanted to go back to the time when maps were mostly blank or had "Dragons here" written on them.
The place where I came closest to such an era's sea was the lagoons on the west side of the Indian Ocean.
When diving far away from shipping lanes and fishing fleets, one can intensely feel the character of the past sea.
Most people haven't heard about Basa d'India, a small coral reef in the Mozambique Channel.
The coral reef serves as a barrier, with the inner lagoon functioning as a breeding ground for Galapagos sharks.
This shark is, even during the day, cannot be considered timid.
I had a feeling that perhaps I might become more daring at night and see more.
Have I ever encountered so many sharks in one coral exposure before?
By capturing and sharing these moments, I reflect on why I chose this path.
This year, I have already worked for National Geographic in Baja California Peninsula.
Approximately halfway along the peninsula's Pacific side, there is the San Ignacio Lagoon, which is important for gray whale breeding grounds.
This coastline was the site where, for over a century, thousands of gray whales were killed, resulting in the death of over 20,000 whales with only a few hundred surviving.
Currently, their descendants play with their children by gently pushing them onto the sea surface or even engage in interactions with us.
This species has truly achieved an amazing revival.
On the other side of the peninsula, there is the quiet fishing town of Cabo Pulmo.
It was on the verge of collapse due to decades of over-exploitation.
In 1995, local fishermen advocated for designatinging that sea as a marine reserve.
What happened afterwards was nothing short of a miracle.
In just over a decade since starting conservation efforts in 2005, fish populations have achieved unprecedented recovery.
"But see it with your own eyes, let's go."
Breathe in and dive deep into the depths where we will explore the largest, most crowded school of fish I encountered.
Everyone can cultivate hope.
Through my photographs, I want to convey that it's not too late to protect our sea.
I particularly want to focus on nature's resilience in the face of 73 billion people.
My wish is, in the future, if I don't thoroughly search, such photos will no longer be able to be taken, to continue capturing photos that serve as examples of coexistence with the sea.
I simply hope that it becomes a commonplace occurrence.
I must be an unmanageably optimistic person to survive and progress in my profession.
I always work under a temporary tent. I think there might be wonderful photos that could provoke change around the next corner, or beyond that coral, in that lagoon, or even further ahead.
