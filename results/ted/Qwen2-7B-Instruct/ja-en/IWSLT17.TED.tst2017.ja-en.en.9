I would like you to raise your hand if you have unfriended someone on Facebook. The reason is that person made some unpleasant remarks about politics, religion, parenting, or food.
"Are there at least one person who is avoiding talking because they don't want to?"
"Once, politely, to engage in conversation, following Professor Higgins' words from 'My Fair Lady', it was sufficient to talk about the weather or health."
Recently, topics like climate change or anti-vaccine have come up - they're no longer safe topics to discuss.
In the world we live in, any conversation has a risk of escalating into an argument, so politicians can't communicate with each other. There are people who passionately debate even on trivial issues, agreeing or disagreeing just for the sake of it, which is not usual.
According to a survey by the Pew Research Center on 10,000 American adults, it has been found that people are polarizing and opposing to an unprecedented extent compared to history.
Everyone refuses to compromise and doesn't have an ear to listen.
And we are already making decisions based on what we believe about where we live, whom we marry, and whom we become friends with.
This is also about not having an ear to listen.
There needs to be a balance between speaking and listening in conversation, but we seem to have lost that balance somewhere.
The development of technology is also a factor.
Cell phones should still be either in your hand or within reach.
According to the Pew Research Center, one-third of young people aged 16 to 24 send over 100 messages per day.
Probably most of them communicate more by messaging than speaking face-to-face.
In the magazine "Atlantic"
There is an interesting article written by a high school teacher named Paul Burnwell.
He gave students communication problems.
I wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific topic without using of notes.
He writes, "I realized—"
"Speaking skills are the most overlooked skill that teachers are failing to teach, according to this."
Students spend hours every day interacting through screens but rarely get opportunities to hone their interpersonal skills.
"It might sound strange, but we should perhaps consider whether, in the 21st century, there is something more important than the ability to confidently and logically converse."
"I am working on speaking. Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, head of state, plumber."
I talk to people I like and those I don't like.
Personally, I also talk to people whose opinions are completely different from mine.
Even so, we can still have wonderful conversations with those people.
In the next ten minutes, I will teach you how to speak and how to listen.
You've probably heard various tips about the art of conversation - things like maintaining eye contact, thinking about interesting topics beforehand, showing attentiveness by nodding or looking directly at the speaker, clapping in rhythm with their speech, smiling, repeating their words, or summarizing what they said.
Please forget all of that.
It won't do any good.
There's no need to learn how to appear as if you're paying attention. If you're actually paying attention,
(Applause) I use my professional interviewer skills in my everyday life.
I will teach you interviewing techniques, but they are useful for improving conversation skills, learn methods to make conversations meaningful, not wasteful or boring, and avoid hurting each other in your interactions.
Everyone has had great conversations.
"YouWhat do you know about it?"
These are conversations where you feel like you've drawn your opponent in, encouraged them, truly connected with them, and come to understand them thoroughly before parting ways.
There's no reason why most conversations can't be like that.
Let's go through the 10 basic rules of conversation together. Mastering even one of these will enable you to enjoy conversations more.
"One: Don't do 'while'"
Not only should we stop fiddling with things like cell phones, tablets, or car keys,
It means being present in body and mind.
It means being there in that moment.
Please don't think about arguments with superiors.
Please don't think about what to have for dinner.
"If you want to withdraw from the conversation, please do so. But refrain from half-hearted participation."
The second one 'Avoid one-sided talking'
If you want to assert your opinion without any response, discussion, rebuttal or opportunity for growth, then writing a blog.
The reason I don't invite people who speak independently on my show is because they're boring.
If you're conservative, you might dislike Obama, food stamps, or abortion.
If you're liberal, you probably dislike big banks, oil companies, or Dick Cheney.
You understand what to say.
You won't become like that, I don't think.
You should approach conversations with the attitude that there is something to learn.
Frenowned therapist M·Scott Peck says, "To really listen, you need to put yourself aside."
This is about sometimes needing to put your own opinion aside.
"When speakers feel accepted, they no longer feel vulnerable and will show their innermost selves to listeners."
Let's repeat it. Approach it with a learning attitude.
Bill N said, "Everyone we meet knows something we don't."
I would say, "Everyone is some kind of expert."
The third one 'Ask open-ended questions'.
Learn from journalists.
"What/where/who/what/how/why" type of questions should start.
Even if you ask complicated questions, you only get simple answers back.
If you ask "Were you scared?"
In response to the most impactful words in the question, in this case '怖かった', the answer would be 'yes' or 'no'.
" Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."
Let's explain it to the other person. They know what they know after all.
This is the kind of question "What was the situation like?"
"How did you feel?"
If so, the other person will be forced to stop and think, resulting in much more interesting answers coming back.
The fourth one 'Go with the flow'.
The thoughts that come to mind must be allowed to leave.
You've probably heard interviews like these before where, after a guest has spoken for several minutes, the host's question bears no relation to what they has just said or repeats something they has already answered.
The host must have stopped to ask two minutes ago, coming up with a clever question and deciding that they absolutely had to ask it.
We are doing exactly the same thing.
"When sitting and chatting with someone, I suddenly recall bumping into actor Hugh Jackman at a cafe."
"And stop asking."
Thoughts and ideas emerge in one's's mind, but.
"Just let them float and fade away."
"That's five: 'If you don't know, say you don't know.'"
People who appear on radio, particularly NPR, are aware that what they said is recorded, so when they claims to be an expert or knows something definitely, they tends to be cautious.
Please do the same, it's okay to be overly cautious.
"Don't dumb down the conversation."
"That sixth point: You must not see the other person's's experience as identical to your own."
It is not to bring up a story about losing a family member when the other person is talking about having lost theirs.
It is not to start talking about how much you hate your job when the other person is discussing problems at work.
The experiences of the other person and oneself are completely different.
All experiences are individual.
What's crucial is that you're not the one speaking.
There is no need to show how splendid or how troubled you are when trying to show the opportunity.
According to the story, Stephen Hawking responded to being asked about his IQ with, "Well then, boasting about IQ is is for losers."
Conversation is not a platform for self-promotion.
"Today's mood? Check out the blog! Episode 7 'Don't say the same thing multiple times.'"
It's annoying when people push their luck too much, but everyone tends to do it.
Especially in workplace conversations or talks with children, one tries to demonstrate the correctness of their own assertions by changing words and repeating them.
"Don't do that."
"That eighth point: Don't fuss over small things."
Frankly, the other person doesn't mind about small details, like dates, names, or year numbers. You might be struggling to recall these when trying to remember something.
The other person isn't interested. The interest is in you.
"What kind of person are you and what common points do you have?"
So let's forget about details. They're not necessary.
This nine: this is not the end but it is the most important thing.
"Listening."
The greatness of how many prominent figures have spoken on this point is unknown, but listening is the most important skill that anyone can improve.
The saying comes from Buddha, albeit slightly rephrased: "When your mouth is open, you learn nothing."
According to the famously silent President Calvin Coolidge, "No one has ever lost their job for listening."
Why don't we try to listen to each other?
One reason is that people often want to speak rather than listen.
When speaking, you have control over yourself.
There is no need to listen when there's no interest.
Gain attention
You can strengthen your identity.
However, there are other reasons as well - to divert attention.
The average person speaks at a rate of 225 words per minute, but we can comprehend up to 550 words per minute.
Our consciousness tries to fill the remaining 225 words.
Certainly, it requires effort and energy to direct attention towards the other person, but without this, conversation does not take place.
The two people are just shouting unrelated words at each other in the same place.
We must listen to each other.
Stephen Covey, the author, appropriately expresses.
"Many people do not actually try to understand when they listen."
"Listening to answer."
There is another rule: number 10 is 'briefly'.
[According to my sister, "a good conversation is like a mini skirt - it should be short enough to attract interest, but long enough to cover the important points."] ( Applause) Everything I've said so far boils down to one thing - "having interest in the other person".
I was raised at my very famous grandfather's place. It was something that was always done in my home.
Grandparents would have various people come to talk, and after the guests left, my mother would ask, "Do you know this person?"
She became almost Miss America.
That person is the mayor of Sacramento.
She
So I believe that everyone has something hidden, something really great within them.
I have started believing in this. I think it's what makes me a good host.
I strive to listen more than speak, keep my mind open, and be impressed. I have never been disappointed with this approach.
Please do the same thing too.
Going out to talk to people, listening to them, and most importantly, expecting to be impressed.
Thank you for your kind attention.
