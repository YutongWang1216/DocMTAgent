This is about how we acquire knowledge.
The protagonist of the story is this woman, Natalia Lipinsky.
As a paleontologist, my specialty is excavating ancient remains.
Natalia Lipinsky: They used to call me the 'Osteology Doctor'.
Latif Nassar: What particularly caught my interest was that the excavation site was was in the far north of the Arctic Circle, in Canada's tundra region, far from civilization.
In the summer of 2006, one day, she was at the excavation site called Filezleafbed. It's not even 10 degrees latitude away from the magnetic North Pole.
Natalia: You might think it's boring. Lugging around a backpack with a GPS and a notebook, just walking around all day picking up things that look like fossils.
Latif: At some point, she noticed something.
Natalia: A large, reddish-brown object, roughly the size of a hand.
It was falling on the ground.
Latif: I initially thought it was just a piece of wood because in the Files Rift Bed, remnants of ancient plants are frequently found.
However, when they night came and they returned to the camp --
Natalia: I took out the magnifying glass and looked at it more closely, but there aren't no growth rings.
It might be due to its preservation state, but the more you look at it, the more...
It was bones.
Latif: She visited this spot over four years, multiple times, gathering a total of 30 identical bone fragments. Most of them are extremely small.
Natalia: There aren't not many of them, they can fit into a small plastic bag.
Latif: I tried to assemble the fragments like puzzle pieces,
It was really a tough job.
Natalia: Since it had shattered into dust, I tried using sand and putty, but it didn't work well.
So, in the end, they used a 3D scanner.
Latif, amazing! Natalia, right?
Latif: It's much easier to work on the screen.
Natalia, when they put all together, I felt a little moved.
Latif, how confident were you about the assembly method?
What would it become if assembled differently? Actually, it was a chicken or something?
Natalia: No, it's correct.
Latif: What she found was a femur, a leg bone, and it was from a cloven-hoofed animal, belonging to the group of cows or sheep.
Just this bone was not supposed to be from cows or sheep.
It was too big.
Natalia, it was a huge size. It is such a big animal.
Latif: What kind of animal was this?
She, who had reached a dead end, showed one of the bone fragments to her colleague in Colorado. That's when she had an idea.
Natalia, when we made a cut on the edge of the bone with a knife, there was a distinctive smell.
Latif, it smelled like charred meat.
In the eerie anatomy room, the smell Natalia detected when she cut the skull was the same as collagen.
Collagen plays a role in maintaining the structure of bones.
As time passes, normally it decomposes.
In this case, the Arctic Circle's climate acts as a natural refrigerator, preserving them.
After one to two years, when Natalia attended a conference in Bristol, a scholar named Mike Backley demonstrated a new procedure called "Collagen Analysis".
The animals have their own unique structure of collagen, and if we come to understand the characteristics of the collagen in the unknown bone, we can compare it with the ones already known, and perhaps even identify it specifically.
So I sent one of the bone pieces by courier.
Natalia, I wanted to follow up on it because because it's important.
Latif, he processed the bone fragment and compared it to three modern mammals.
We found a matching animal.
The owner of the 3.5 million-year-old bone that Natalia unearthed in the high northern latitudes of the Arctic, was none other than
It was a llama.
Natalia thought, 'Really?' This would be incredible if true.
Latif: He tested many bone pieces, but all the results were the same.
However, considering the size of the found bone, this llama was about 30 larger than the current ones.
The height was approximately 2.5m - the weight was around 1 ton.
"Yes."
What Natalia discovered was a 'Giant Arctic Llama'.
When you think of a llama, you might picture the two-humped Bactagor llama that inhabits East and Central Asia,
The image in your head, probably, is this dromedary camel. When you think of desert creatures, this is it. It lives in hot deserts like the Middle East or the Sahara Desert. It stores water in its large hump, useful for long desert journeys, and moves forward by toding the sand dunes with its broad feet.
Why did such an animal reach the Arctic Circle in northern Canada?
Actually, scientists had known something before Natalia's discovery. Specifically, the original habitat of the llama was America.
This is where it was born.
Since the appearance of llamas, approximately 45 million years have passed. Among these, there were about 20 species, probably more, distributed solely in North America for almost 40 million years.
Latif, can you tell the differences if we arrange everything?
Natalia, yes, the sizes vary.
There were also very long-necked types, something similar to a giraffe's neck.
Latif, there was a creature with a crocodile-like face.
Natalia: The early, primitive llamas were incredibly small, about the size of rabbits.
Latif: What? A rabbit-sized llama?
Natalia: It's an early species.
It's hard to tell just by looking, isn't it?
Latif: I might consider keeping a rabbit-lama.
Natalia: Yes, definitely the best.
Latif, after that, a herd of llamas descended from South America about 3-4.5 million years ago, became alpacas and camels. Different breeds crossed the Bering Land Bridge and went to Asia or Africa.
At the end of the last ice age, the North American llama had gone extinct.
This much is is already known, yet it cannot fully explain the discovery made that far north.
For example, in terms of temperature, it is the opposite of the Sahara Desert.
Indeed, the temperatures 3.5 million years ago were on average 22 degrees higher than today.
So, it may have resembled the current Yukon river basin and Siberia with its widespread coniferous forest.
But still, winter lasted for six months, the pond would have frozen over.
There were also blizzards.
There must have been times when the darkness of night lasted for 24 hours.
"What exactly is this?"
How did this superstar of the Sahara Desert survive in the Arctic climate?
Natalia and her fellow scholars believe they have found the answer.
And it's a wonderful answer.
If the features we've attributed to the llama's adaptation to places like the Sahara Desert were actually evolved to help it survive winter?
If the wide feet were not for walking on sand, but designed for walking like a kangaroo on snow?
The hump on its back - I was surprised because didn't know - is filled with fat instead of water. If that hump helped it survive the winter, which lasted several months during food scarcity?
If, after crossing the land bridge, it took some time and then used the winter-oriented features in the hot desert environment?
For example, the hump might be useful even in hot climates, because by storing the body's fat in one place like a backpack, insulation can be achieved without needing to cover the entire body.
Then it would become easier to dissipate heat.
This seemingly absurd notion could serve as evidence of adaptation to desert conditions, potentially turning out to be proof of its past habitation in high latitude Arctic regions.
This is not the first time I've told this story.
Through this narrative, others have recounted the marvels of evolutionary biology and used it as a clue to decipher future climate changes.
But the reason I like this story is different.
For me, this is my own story, about my worldview and how it changes.
As a historian, I have received education.
The realization was that most scientists are also historians.
They too, try to understand the past.
I will speak about the history of life on Earth, and planets or the universe.
And as a historian, I start by imagining the unfolding of the story.
Natalia, we create stories and stick to them, like the story of the desert llama.
It's a well-made story; the llama is perfectlylly adapted.
They're always in the desert.
Latif, but maybe one day we'll find that small evidence.
Perhaps by understanding the small things, everything you believed may need to be rebuilt.
In this case too, a single scientist's discovery of a fossil fragment, akin to a piece of wood, became the catalyst for a novel hypothesis that transcends conventional wisdom, much like a creature appearing in Dr. Seuss's picture books. Science has arrived at this entirely new explanation for why this animal takes such a peculiar form.
My view on the llama has changed.
From viewing it as an extremely specialized animal that can only adapt to a specific environment like the desert, it shifted to seeing it as an animal capable of surviving anywhere in the world, even in the Sahara Desert where it just happens to be found, rather than just being adapted to its own particular habitat.
(The applause) This is Azur.
Hello Azur, nice to meet you.
"EHere, have some food."
Azur usually performs at Radio City Music Hall.
It's no joke.
Now, this Azur serves as living evidence of just how dynamic our story about the world is.
We must reassemble the story and rethink it.
Aren't we right? Azur.
There lies a new way of seeing the world behind even a single fragment of bone.
Thank you.
