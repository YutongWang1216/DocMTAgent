In 1990, when I moved to Harare, social justice was at the core of Zimbabwe's health policy.
At the end of a long independence war, a new government emerged and immediately declared socialist policies, resulting in medical services and primary education becoming essentially free.
We significantly increased the number of local healthcare facilities, achieving remarkable results where almost 80% of the population can access healthcare facilities within a two-hour walk.
In 1980, when Zimbabwe gained independence, the rate of childhood vaccinations within the country was was only 25%.
In just 10 years, by 1990, it reached 80%.
I was truly proud of being involved in this great reform.
The enthusiasm and solidarity were visible.
I marched shoulder-to-shoulder with highly capable scientists, doctors, and activists, feeling like I was part of not only the African independence movement but also a leading public health campaign on a global scale.
However, there was was a terrible problem.
When I arrived in 1982, Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS case.
During my residency training at the Hetty General Hospital in the early 1980s, I had treated several AIDS patients - but had no idea what was approaching Africa was.
The HIV infection rate during the early period of my stay was around 2%.
That had sharply risen, with one in four adults infected, which was the situation when I left Harare after 15 years.
By the mid-90s, I had informed hundreds of productive individuals that they were HIV-positive.
I experienced the deaths of colleagues and friends, and also witnessed the deaths of students and patients.
In response to this, I set up a clinic with my colleagues.
Demonstrating how to use condoms.
I started sexual education in schools or workplaces.
Conducting case investigations or instructing infected individuals' partners on preventive methods.
I was working hard, and at that time, I felt like I was doing my best.
I thought I was giving good treatment, looking back now, it was rather rough.
However, I did not engage in activities seeking structural reforms.
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan candidly admitted that his misjudgment led Rwanda to genocide.
He said he was the UN PKO Chief of Mission when the genocide occurred in 1994.
At the memorial service for the 10 year of the genocide, reflectinging back to that time, "I was convinced that that we were doing our best, but realized the genocide happened. There were more things that could have been done, things that should have been done. I realized that there were things that needed to be done, to sound the alarm and to seek cooperation."
The AIDS pandemic caught the medical community off guard, and it's not just me who regrets not acting sooner, given the 39 million lives already lost to AIDS according to the World Health Organization's estimates.
However, during my stay in Zimbabwe, I did not place myself in the position of advocating for change or political positions.
In order to utilize my professional skills, I was here as a clinical doctor and also as an epidemiological researcher.
In my heart, I believed that my duty was to care for patients and conduct investigations to deepen understanding of the infection patterns in the community. If I could do that, I thought I could contain the spread of this virus.
I was aware of the higher risk of AIDS onset and death for socially disadvantaged groups.
In sugar cane plantations, akin to feudal era manors more so than any modern corporate organization, 60% of pregnant women were HIV positive.
I taught them that just because someone is infected doesn't mean they person is shameless, rather, it's the product of male-dominated culture, forced seasonal labor, and colonization.
The white population suffered little to no harm.
As healthcare professionals, we felt powerless to the extent of pain. We could only plead for changes in individual behavior, urging people to use condoms, and reducing the number of sexual partners they had.
The infection rate kept rising. While medicines for treatment were developed in the West - the most effective effective AIDS treatment currently available - they remained out of reach for all public sectors across Africa.
I remained silent. I did not speak about the fact that life-saving drugs were not equally accessible, nor about the political and economic systems underlying the AIDS pandemic - the mechanisms that had caused such a massive outbreak.
I justified my silence to myself. "I am not a citizen of this country, so if I were to sound the alarm, I might be deported, lose my job, unable to treat patients, and unable to carry out the necessary research."
So I remained silent, not expressing any opinions on the government's then-policy towards AIDS.
I did not sufficiently assert my concerns.
Many doctors and healthcare workers probably didn't think I made a mistake.
It is a promise between a physician and a patient - the Hippocratic Oath, or its various editions, established the sanctity of the relationship between a doctor and a patient.
I did everything I could for myself, and I gave my best to each of my patients.
However, I recognized that such a massive outbreak reflected the distortion of society. It was not merely due to biological factors, rather, it originated from practices that excluded and marginalized the weak, promoting discrimination based on ethnicity, gender, sexuality, social class, and so forth.
AIDS fits into this.
The Ebola of recent times was too.
Medical anthropologists who have carried out anti-AIDS activities in Haiti, such as Paul Farmer, refer to this as "structural violence". By calling it "structural", it means that inequality is embedded in our society's political and economic structures, and often, those with privilege and power do not see it. By referring to it as "violence", it means that this phenomenon results in - death and suffering at a young age, and illness - which are violent.
If you wish to be of any help to the patient, you must not neglect the recognition of such societal inequalities.
Calling attention to the issue is the first step to get public health functioning. By doing so, we gather supporters, carve out paths together, and bring about genuine change.
Therefore, recently, I also do not remain silent.
I speak on many things, even when it makes listeners uncomfortable or feels awkward for me to say.
In most cases, such as regarding racial disparities or institutionalized racial discrimination, this should not be happening in this country - let alone in healthcare settings or public health, where such occurrences are absolutely unacceptable - when it comes to matters.
That is the cost people are paying in shortened lives for the existence of such disparities.
Therefore, the alarm bells must ring - the racism present in American healthcare, and the ongoing systemic, interpersonal violence - the violence inflicted upon people of color - something America carries as a painful legacy from the 25-year era of slavery, the 90 years of Jim Crow laws, and the 6 decades of incomplete equality, all of which contributed to escalating violence. It is my duty as the Commissioner of Health in New York City to sound these alarms.
In New York City, the under-65 mortality rate for black men is 55% higher than that for white men.
In 2012, the maternal mortality rate for black women women was over 10 times that of white women.
Infant survival rates have dramatically improved, but black infants still face a risk of dying within their first year that is nearly three times higher than that of white infants.
It is not just New York that is special.
Similar statistics can be found found seen in anywhere in America.
According to a recent analysis in the New York Times, it seems that 1.5 million American men are lacking.
According to the article, it seems that more than one out of every 22 black men aged 25 to 54 has disappeared from daily life, either incarcerated or deceased.
Significant injustices exist, targeting young black men with what is happening to them as wrongful violence, the kind of violence that is the subject of protests under the banner of #BlackLivesMatter.
However, what should be remembered is that despite the different occurrence rates, the continuous occurrence and outcomes of common diseases - heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or AIDS, etc., diseases that lead to a slow and quiet death - among young people dying from these diseases, black people are losing even more lives.
When the #BlackLivesMatter movement started, I felt frustration and anger. This was because in the medical community, it has been avoided to use the word 'racism' even in research or work.
Every time I use this word, do you all also think of something?
Most members of the medical community stood idly by as the medical students, dressed in white coats and protesting, ignored the ongoing discrimination that continues to affect diseases and mortality rates. The concern I have is...
In the contemporary trend towards personalized medicine and precision medicine, where we seek tailored treatments for individuals and delve into biological and genetic research, there's a risk of overlooking the bigger picture. It is the everyday environment - the place where people live, grow, work, and love - that has the greatest impact on people's health, and is harming far too many people's health.
As healthcare professionals, we encounter tremendous injustice in our daily work, whether in a clinic or in research. Homeless individuals struggle to follow doctors' instructions because there are more pressing priorities. Transgender youths contemplate suicide due to the heartless society. Single mothers bear the responsibility for their children's health.
The role of a physician as a healthcare provider goes beyond just treating patients; it involves calling attention and advocating for change.
Doctors, regardless of their justifications, carry significant weight in their social status, so it would be a waste not to utilize it.
I regret not raising my voice in in Zimbabwe and have sworn to myself. As Commissioner of Health in New York City, I will utilize all opportunities to the fullest, call for attention, and advocate for collaboration towards the improvement of health disparities.
We also stand against racism. Please lend a hand. When you face gender discrimination, I'll support you. For any other form of inequality, I'll assist.
Now is the time for us to rise up and collectively raise our voices against structural inequality.
There is no need to know all the answers to call for reform.
It's just a matter of courage.
The health of our patients, and our own health, is at stake.
