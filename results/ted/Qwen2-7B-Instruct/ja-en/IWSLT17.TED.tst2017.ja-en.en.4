"At that moment, I was trembling with fear, waiting for the last moment of my life in a Texas church filled with my soul and body."
"Truly in such a venue, sitting somewhat on a chair made of a broken wooden frame covered by a red traggy cloth on the left was an organ, behind which the choir waited, and further back, there were a baptismal tub prepared."
"There is no change."
"Rising tension, earnest desire for salvation, sweaty palms, and those seated at the back who seem not much interested."
"OnOn December 31, 1999, on the night of Christ's supposed return, when I believed the world would end."
"That year, I turned 12 years old. It's the age where one is officially recognized as a 'grown-up' in terms of baptism."
"Yet, it feels unjust that the world should end like this. I wanted to complain, but, it's too late now. I am being compelled to reconsider the future."
"Change my heart and visit the church as much as possible."
"I prayed sincerely, as if to forget the passage of time. I was desperate, hoping that God would notice my lack of faith and that His impending arrival wouldn't be sooner than planned."
"Furthermore, out of utmost concern, I was scouring books like 'Please save me', which were popular at the time."
"One day, I found it within a sentence. If one's's faith is lacking, there lies a greater tragedy awaiting them should fate strike."
"Regardless, the task imposed upon me is to control all desires, triumph over the devil and laziness, and conquer my own lack of faith."
"At 12, it's tough, let's believe we can do it."
"It is getting close to that time."
"11:50 PM"
"Left with 10 minutes, the priest gathered us at the altar, inviting us to meet the time when the clock's would point to the fateful moment, accompanied by deep prayer."
"All denominations will gather together."
The choir remained seated at their seats, taking positions at the front row right before the altar - one could say, the bourgeoisie churchgoers's, stood in front of the altar.
"As you know, even in America, VIP seats are prepared for the Second Coming of Christ.
The applause echoed. Those just behind the VIPs seats are the elderly. In the glaring sunlight of East Texas, they makes me think of their backs, tirelessly working in the cotton fields during their prime years. Their sunburnt, wrinkle-free skin seems like the earth itself. They've had their hopes dashed several times, dreaming of walking a different life if they could. These are the ones I'm talking about.
They are truly the main actors for me.
"They have dedicated their entire lives to this moment, living for the talk show that starts at four every day, much like their medieval predecessors eagerly awaited the coming of the end times."
Like my grandmother, so too will this grandmother head towards the altar. I quietly followed her back, certain that she would surely go to heaven.
While holding her hand during the prayer, I was thought, maybe we could both go to heaven, if fate allows.
"I gripped their hand, closed my eyes, listened intently, and prayed."
The牧師's voice was was rough.
The prayers in response echo as cries, reverberating throughout the church.
The keyboard melody increased in intensity.
The accompanying heat enveloped the church.
To ensure she doesn't get left behind, I'll hold my grandmother's hand again.
In front of the horror of destiny, I escaped into the darkness behind my eyes.
And that voice pours down, 'Amen.'
"It's over."
"The hands of the clock were"
"It's already past the fateful hour."
"The savior didn't appear, and I stared, trying not to let on their efforts to hide their disappointment, too deeply and for too long, that I missed noticing new possibilities."
I felt my heart ache at their presence.
They were being deceived, victims of deception, and I was was one of them.
"I have continued to pray, making no effort to succumb to temptation."
I am the one who experienced that trial baptism twice, not once but twice. I believed.
Until then, it was certainly true.
Upon returning home and turning on the TV, Peter Jennings was celebrating the dawn of the new millennium, and the news was spreading worldwide.
At that moment, a strange thought occurred to me; perhaps God visits repeatedly, taking into account the time difference.
This flash was was so foolish and cruel.
However, I did not stop believing.
And I embrace a new faith. The answer is not one, but is a faith.
My answer was wrong; the problem itself was wrong. It is my faith in facing that awkwardness.
A new ray of faith, like melting snowwater filled with possibilities, begins to flow towards unseen landscapes, thawing the frozen, motionless winter mountain called "belief".
I often look back on that night when the savior didn't come. Even if what collapsed in that fleeting moment when what I believed in shattered wasn't a lie, I realized it wasn't not the truth at that instant.
In the midst of many people celebrating the year 2000 in entirely different ways, there might also be those who have reached the same process of being here, after I went through something similar afterwards. Starting with the dawn of the new millennium, my mother left, never contacting my father, and even God rejected me from that very day.
I reached out my hand, this time to grasp something believable.
At 18, I enrolled in Yale University. It was a perfect opportunity for me to sever ties with all the dark past I saw in Oak Cliff, Texas - the shattered dreams and lost hopes. I believed it was the best chance to break away from everything.
However, during one of my winter vacations, I found found lying face down on the floor of my house with both hands tightly bound behind me. A robber held a gun to my head. That was when I finally realized that education would not save me.
In 2008, I reached out my hand once again, this time for the next salvation, it was Lehman Brothers.
Looking to the future with hope, I hurriedly called home, determined that money would no longer cause suffering.
However, even in the heart of finance, it crumbled right before my eyes, making a loud noise. Even in business, I was left behind.
Persistently reaching in Washington, I reach reaching out as a youth staff for the next hope. The voices echoing from Illinois shout loudly, "The time has come," "Change is brought to America."
However, the legislature faltered; the nation tore apart the hope, and 'Change' became an unamusing joke. Even with politics returning, nothing happened; they were not saved.
I solemnly swore allegiance at the altar named American Dream, kneeling to the god of capitalism. I pledged for success, wealth, and power.
Regardless, when the new day breaks, I am awake. Was there really no God?
I decided to face that night again, not because I was brave, but rather between dying or believing, there was nothing else left for me to choose.
And I moved forward towards the next holy land, Harvard Business School. This time, I did not yield to the tempting salvation offered, because I knew the price it came with.
I'm still lacking in my efforts.
As the harsh Cambridge winter had just begun, one evening, three friends and I brought up a common topic that young people often experience - the usual subject of "let's go on a trip". This conversation took place in a quiet corner of an enthusiastic party.
I didn't know where to go or how to go about it.
However, I was possessed by Jack Kerouac's novel, "On the Road". We set out, wanting to know what is happening in this country, "to get out at night and quietly disappear."
Of course, there were many opposing voices, and more importantly, the voices were coherent, but I still took that step forward.
In the summer of 2013, a 8000-mile journey around America began. It traversed through through Montana's grasslands, Detroit's ruins, and the swamps of New Orleans. The scenes of meeting people along the way, who earn a living by doing business and living day-to-day, are depicted.
To me, who had been refined at the pinnacle of capitalism, it was rather innovative.
This idea has grown and transformed into the "MBAs Across America" initiative. It was also what led to me being placed on the TED stage.
How voracious our generation is when it comes to goals and meaning.
We realized the signs of that wave. We needed to provide a little more support for those many entrepreneurs creating jobs out of nowhere, shouldering reforms, and vital to society.
We finally realized it, and to be honest, another important thing is that I also made an effort to cause a wave.
Certainly, once there were thoughts that each social enterprise could heal and comfort the wounds of this country on the verge of collapse, inspiring many people to believe they could rise again.
However, this mission has led me to a new gospel, and that is what brings me here today.
Approximately one year ago, on a certain afternoon, I was at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, at the reunion of Harvard Business School alumni.
Under the life-size whale replica hanging from the ceiling, we shared a table with the contemporaries of our time, praising the achievements of our alumni and the spirit of social contribution.
The gathering there, and their assets, were filled with pride in a space that exceeded 550 billion dollars.
Upon looking back at what we have accomplished, everything is beautiful.
However, this is not the end. Two days later, I had a purpose in Harlem district. Sitting in a corner of the farm built on the place that used to be an empty lot, I listened to stories about the children that visit the farm every day from a man named Tony.
This is the story of children living below the poverty line.
Even when they sleeping, they must hold their belongings, for fear of them being stolen at homeless shelters.
The program named 'Harlem Grown', that's what Tony's program is, these kids bring one meal a day for these children.
After a 20-year career as a taxi driver, Tony began the program by cutting his pension.
They didn't pay him; they were struggling for funds as their activities expanded.
He said he was going to cling to anything like straws.
And I resolve to cling to that straw.
The way back, a dull sound echoed in my heart, and all I could do was let tears flow down.
It was simply due to ignorance. Under one roof, a whale replica floated, while people moving millions of dollars gathered there. Two days later, under the sky just 55 blocks north, a man was tirelessly running around, preparing a child's meal for free.
I did not weep out of inequality. Not out of pity for the hungry or homeless children. Not out of anger towards the wealth of the 1%, nor sympathy for the poverty of the 99%.
I was just reeling here, faced with the fact that I am the country with kidney disease, that I am the dialysis machine.
I realized that my story was was for those who must keep walking even if they have no shoes, for the sake of such people. For the organizations and voices that had been overlooked up until now - in haremsms, Appalachia, and the disaster-stricken areas of New Orleans - to deliver effective effective assistance, there existed my organization and my voice. That was precisely what they were meant to reach to - all the unheard voices that had been regarded as illiterate and innocent.
That spark made me utterly ashamed, and reminded me of how Peter Jennings' announced new millennium had repeatedly deceived and betrayed me with its endless cycle of injustice.
I was being misled.
However, this time, I myself was the false savior. Having believed that the world would end that night on that altar, I ended up going around quite a bit. It is the suffering that is repayment to God, and that all of God's words are truth, and that the holy scriptures are the truth.
Having believed in that world for so long, I've come back to the starting point after traveling a long way.
Our time to live now is is not an age of disbelief, rather, we firmly believe that it is an age that we do not fall short of the past.
Brene Brown, perhaps there are those who believe in her words, maybe Tony Robbins.
"The New Yorker", "Harvard Business Review"
There must be those who believe in them too. After all, aren't we offering prayers in this TED church right now? We want to believe, it's necessary for us to believe.
We are all longing for such a leader who can solve every problem.
I believe that suffering is necessary evil in the religion of capitalism. I believe that the absolute sanctity of technological progress is the sacred scripture in this god.
However, fearing the摇晃 of things I believe in from their base, I become too hesitant to doubt even a single element of the base, overlooking the human sacrifices that occur as a result.
If there's something you can't avoid, then it's time to stop and reevaluate when it's hindering you.
The gospel of creativity and innovation, bearing witness to responsibilities towards society, environment, and economy, is not my domain.
Actually, I'm not trying to spread any doctrines here.
I am here for the gospel of skepticism.
This gospel is is not about telling you to stop believing; it simply asks for a new attitude - the thinking that there is isn't not just one answer.
Leaving room to acknowledge the awkwardness that even questioning itself might be wrong, and accepting past mistakes.
The gospel of skepticism, which I am here for, is suggesting that all could be wrong in this place and this space.
"Why" is the gospel itself.
Where is is the necessity for people to suffer aimlessly, simply because we've been given the power to question?
From this belief in questioning, I made a decision regarding my own activities. I transformed 'MBAs Across America' into a non-profit organization.
Reduced the number of organization's staff, stopped new hires, and opened-source our business model so that anyone needing it can freely utilize it.
The question "why" demanded from me was the relinquishment of the role of savior that people had tasked me with. In the face of the truth that miracles do not occur, there's no reason to wait for Christ's return again, as our lives are simply too short for that.
The gospel of doubt, even when it seems like a path to despair and nowhere to go, should give you courage and hope, shining a light ahead for you. Even in difficult and painful times, don't drown yourself in blind faith - deliberately question that inner voice that, though small and faint, becomes an irreplaceable light that illuminates the darkness. Whisper it if you must.
Shout it out, simply put it into words, "There is must be another way."
Thank you.
