"My hometown is the most free, tolerant, and progressive place in the United States - Seattle, Washington."
"I grew up in a family of wonderful Seattle natives."
"My mother is an artist and my father is a university professor. I am very grateful for the environment I was brought up in. That's because I was always able to decide my own way of living without worrying about anything, as I could do whatever I wanted."
"I did not actually follow the path that my parents had envisioned."
"At 19, I dropped out of university - whether it was dropping out or withdrawing, it doesn't matter to me."
"And I started touring as a professional horn player, fulfilling a lifelong dream."
While engaging in chamber music performances, I traveled around the United States and Europe for several years, performing with excellent jazz guitarist Charlie Bird.
"And by the end of my 20s's, I became a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain."
"What a wonderful life it must be."
"My parents never complained."
"They have always supported me."
"It wasn't not their ideal, you know."
"It seems he was telling people in the neighborhood and to friends, 'My son is in gap year - about 10 years now.'"
"But - there was was one awkward conversation about my way of living, so let's talk about it."
"I was 21 years old when I was on a visit home from Barcelona. During Christmas vacation, I was returning to my family home, cooking together with my mother in the kitchen, just the two of us."
"My mother became silent, too silent."
"I thought something was wrong."
"When I asked 'Mother, what are you thinking?', she would respond..."
"My mother said, 'We're really worried about you.'"
"What's going on?" I wondered, even though it was too late now.
"Please answer me honestly—have you not voted for the Republican party?"
"Well, the truth is, I was just a simple horn player who didn't have much interest in politics."
"My parents were a bit taken aback by something I realized, and they seemed to have noticed it."
"I was a fervent supporter of capitalism. I will explain how I came to be like that."
The interest in a certain matter that I've had since long ago originates from this. Surprisingly, it is "poverty".
I remember seeing genuine poverty for the first time during my childhood in Seattle.
My family was of the lower middle class, but naturally, it is not true poverty.
It was a long way off.
The first time I saw poverty or the appearance of poverty was in the early 70s, when I was six or seven years old.
It was an ordinary experience that everyone has experienced.
The photographs featured in National Geographic, showing East African children around my age, their faces covered in flies and their bellies swollen.
"It was obvious that there was nothing could be done for them anymore, but there was nothing I could do for them."
There may be people who remember such a photo. Not the exact same one, but something similar.
The photographs exposed the suffering caused by poverty to the Western world.
The image stuck in my mind, even as I grew up, attended school, dropped out or went back to school, and even after I got married, I couldn't forget it.
I wondered about that child's fate.
I wonder how those people all over the world, like that one, turned out.
I began to investigate there. Although I was not at the university then, I was sought the answer: what happened to the people at the extreme of global poverty?
Has it worsened? Has it improved? What has happened to it?
And when the answer was found, my life changed. I will tell you all about it.
Now— most Americans believe that poverty has worsened. When they were children - they believe it was have worsened compared to when they saw that photograph.
If asked by Americans if global poverty has worsened or improved, 77% would answer that hunger has worsened since the early 70s.
Let me teach you the truth.
The enlightenment that changed my worldview changed is this.
From 1972 to today, the proportion of people in the world who have been living in famine conditions - those living on less than one dollar a day - naturally accounting for inflation rate adjustments - the share of such people has decreased by 80 percent.
Compared to when I was a child, the worst poverty in the world has decreased by 80 percent.
"I didn't know such things."
This is a miracle, everyone.
It is something to be happy about.
As a measure against poverty, it is the greatest achievement in human history, and it happened in our generation.
(A applause) When I found this, I couldn't help but wonder, what made this possible?
Why did it happen? I can't recreate it if I don't understand why.
In order to replicate this success and save another 2 billion people from poverty - which is the main topic here - my siblings and I, being "the little ones" as mentioned in the scriptures, have managed to escape poverty so far from my childhood till now.
In order to save another 2 billion people, I want to know.
So, I started looking for the answer.
The answer had nothing to do with politics; it didn't matter to me.
There is still no interest.
What I wanted was the best answer from mainstream economists, regardless of whether they were right-wing, left-wing, or centrist.
Let's give that answer.
The success factors are five.
Saving our brothers and sisters around the world, 2 billion people, from poverty up until now has been...
The first is globalization.
The second is free trade.
The third is property rights.
The fourth is rule of law.
The fifth is entrepreneurship.
It became possible after the 1970s when the whole world was corporatized under free enterprise system.
Just, I'm not simple.
I know that free enterprise isn't perfect, and I also understand that there are other things needed besides free enterprise to build a better world.
But it's amazing, you know.
It's an issue beyond politics.
"What I've learned and what I've realized"
The significance of capitalism does not merely lie in the accumulation of wealth.
The best thing about capitalism is is ambition. Many people talk about it on this stage, you see. That is, ambition born from desire, deeply connected to a free enterprise system.
We must expand this ambition.
Let me tell you about the second enlightenment here. It's related to the first one, bringing progress not just to the world but also to this city we're in right now. Not just to the world, but also to this city we're in right now.
Among all the words I've heard from people, the way I explained poverty alleviation just now seems to be the most coherent. "There is no system in human history that has created wealth more than a free market.
"That's because it's lifted billions out of poverty."
Who said those words?
The tone sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
"No."
The President Barack Obama.
Why can we say that there?
That's because I was told directly.
You'll find it hard to believe.
What came out of my mouth was "Hip-Hip-Hooray!"
In addition, I thought, "What a wonderful opportunity."
You can probably guess what I was thinking.
In May 2015, during an event on this topic, it was regarding George Washington University.
This is what I thought was the solution to America's biggest problem. What do you think?
It's about reaching to those who need us most under the idea that the free market solves poverty, regardless of whether you're liberal or conservative.
Everyone knows that crises are happening everywhere in America and around the world, due to political polarization.
We are now at a critical situation.
It's an unpleasant situation. This won't do.
Last year, a paper was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the most authoritative scientific academic journal published in the Western world.
In the 2014 paper, the theme was "Asymmetric political motives".
This refers to, in the psychological scholar's definition, that one's own ideology comes from love, but but deciding that the worldview of the enemy comes from hatred.
It's common in conflicts around the world.
For example, phenomena observed between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the authors of this paper have uncovered is that in today's America, both the Republicans and Democrats have majority in 'asymmetric political motives'.
In today's America, the majority of politically fervent people believe that they move due to love, while they think their opponents act out of hatred.
Please consider this.
Most people think like this: "My ideology is based on very fundamental tolerance, I just want to help others, but they're trying to trap me as the evil ones."
As long as there is asymmetry of this sort, we cannot progress as a society.
It is not possible.
What is the solution then?
Let us be honest first, differences are natural after all.
Do not underestimate the differences, it is not that simple.
There are many excellent studies on this.
Veteran TED speaker and friend Jonathan Haidt is
Teaches psychology at New York University.
The author conducts research on various differences in ideologies, values systems, and moral perspectives among different people.
According to him, for example, conservatives and liberals seem to prioritize very differently what is important.
According to Haidt, within liberals, those who focus on poverty issues tend to prioritize economic freedom over those who do not by 59%.
According to the source, within conservatives, those who prioritize economic freedom tend to be 28% more likely to focus on poverty issues.
This difference doesn't seem to be narrowing, does it?
Absolutely incompatible? That's a mistake.
This lies in diversity, where our strength lies.
Are you wondering what it was that has lifted the poor out of poverty?
The determination towards poverty issues led to the spread of free economy as a means worldwide.
In other words, we need each other. If we want to save the next 2 billion people from poverty,
There is is no other way.
"Well then,"
How can it be achieved?
It's hard, isn't it?
Innovative thinking is is required.
There are many on this stage.
Social entrepreneurship - that's right, there's no mistake. Absolutely top-notch.
Sustainable, ethical, and responsible overseas investment is is required.
"Exactly! But what is the really necessary thing?"
A new world with flexible ideologies.
More unpredictability is needed.
Well?
Have you ever felt that your ideology has conformed to a type?
Isn't it a bit cliché, you know?
Are you ever thinking that you're just listening to people who share your opinion?
"Why is is this dangerous?"
"Because when we talk about economics in this country, the right side is occupied by conservatives, constantly talking about taxes, regulations, big government."
On the left side, there are liberals, and whenever we talk about economics, it's always about income inequality.
Both are important things. Something truly important for both of us.
When we talk about rescuing people from poverty who are suffering from hunger today and in need of assistance, this gets in the way.
We should cooperate under the best methods for alleviating poverty, utilizing the highest level tools available to us within our freedom. This is possible only when conservatives recognize the dedication of liberals towards poverty issues, and liberals acknowledge the commitment of conservatives towards free markets.
This diversity, once accepted, will become one of America's strengths going forward.
"How can we together achieve this?"
"We need a list of activities, not just for everyone but for myself as well."
"Number 1 - Please keep in mind that merely accepting differing opinions is not enough."
"That's insufficient."
"We should remember that there are those who do not agree with us, and they are necessary. There are people still waiting for these tools provided by our diversity."
"What should we do? How should we communicate?"
Where does it start? Here.
"We are all blessed to be in this room together."
We are blessed to have people who listen to us.
"We are also blessed in terms of success and leadership."
Even discussing ideologies that I never thought about before, they might listen attentively.
Progress might start from there.
"That's the first one. And the second one is..."
"I want you to become someone like that, and there's also a type of person I aspire to be myself. Someone who can make boundaries ambiguous. It's hard for me to fit into types of people who are ambiguous and indecisive."
To the conservative, speak of the moral obligation to always discuss poverty and fight for the poor, as a conservative would.
For liberals, we need someone who constantly talks about the goodness of the free market when utilized responsibly in solving our problems.
By doing so, two things will be realized.
Firstly, I can tackle the relief for the next 2 billion people, just like what I've done with many in the past, taking on the necessary solutions for the future.
Secondly, we can transform the horrifically ideological battle we experience under this country into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect. We can turn it into a competition of ideas grounded in solidarity and mutual respect.
Then, you might realize that perhaps the big difference we think exists might not be that large after all.
"Thank you."
