Food crisis
It has been in the news every day.
What does it mean?
In the world, food shortages or over-supply is happening depending on the location.
On the other hand, GMOs is saving the world.
There may be drawbacks to GMO as well.
Excessive agricultural runoff is polluting the sea, introducing toxins, and reducing nutrient value.
This sort of thing continues endlessly.
I am very discouraged by today's's discussion on the environment.
How can we work towards solving issues with our current knowledge?
Let's look at the apple food problem.
Everyone ate an apple last week, right?
How much do you think has passed since that apple was picked?
"Two weeks?"
"Two months?"
11 months - This is the average for apples in American grocery stores.
I don't think there's much difference in Europe or other countries around the world.
Picking apples, storing them in the refrigerator, and sealing them with a preservation gas is recorded. There are also records of workers deaths when trying to retrieve apples from this preservation chamber, due to the toxic nature of the air that slows down apple spoilage for humans.
Why was no one knew about this?
"Why didn't I know about this?"
Ninety percent of the antioxidant components in apples are lost by the time they are eaten.
This is just a lump of sugar.
"Why are we so lacking in information? What measures can be taken for improvement?"
It's because the platform is missing.
Speaking of platforms, think of computers. Back then, there were really dangerous things happening online.
Did it  on this platform, you know.
However, I was able to meet people and express myself.
The methods of expressing oneself using food?
If there were a platform, asking "what if..." would become more freely askable.
My question was was, if climate were equal for everyone?
This is the world's climate map.
Productive areas are shown in green, and low areas in red.
The color changes and moves. The agricultural center that was in California is now moved to Mexico.
Brazil is where China grows better food. We are adapting to the climate.
If each country had a climate suitable for production?
How will that change people's's lives?
Will it change the quality of life and nutrition?
The problem for the previous generations was was to obtain more food - affordably.
Welcome to the world of global farms.
Humans have built a massive analog farm.
The lines depicted here represent food transportation connected by vehicles, aircraft, and railways.
It's miraculous that food to sustain 7 billion people is produced by such a small fraction of the population.
If only...
If we could build digital farms?
It refers to a worldwide digital farm.
If we could extract this apple, digitize it, transmit it as particles through the air, and reconstruct it at another location?
If only...
I started this research being stimulated by the sentences written here.
Firstly - There's no future for young labor, water, or land in Japanese agriculture. Seeing this, at that moment, I headed towards [South Sendai], directly north of [F Fukushim], which had been hit by the earthquake.
Due to the contamination of the land, the children moved to places like Sendai and Tokyo. Japan already relies on imports for about 7 to 7% of its food.
Food shortages are not exclusive to Japan.
In America, only 2% of the population is involved in agriculture.
No matter which country, at such a small scale, there are limited things that can be done.
Looking at other countries - 50% of Africa's population is under 18.
Their 84% do not want to become farmers.
Agriculture is is heavy labor.
The life of farmers who run small-scale agriculture is is miserable.
Flow towards the urban area.
In India, where farmers are not even receiving supplies of water and electricity, the number of farmers who committed suicide this year was the highest in the past decade.
It's really a nasty story.
Where are the farmers going?
In the urban area.
Youth do not remain in the local areas; they all flow to the urban areas.
"How can we build platforms that motivate the youth?"
Introducing our new tractor!
This is the combine I created.
A few years ago, I started doing handicraftss when I went to local stores or DIY shops.
I started creating unusual things, trying to make plants dance. When I connected them to a computer, they all died. It was a huge number.
It has been made to not die.
I have constructed something that becomes one of the closest relationships in my life. That is, I started to understand the language of plants.
When you wish to grow them bigger.
They said, "Do it thoroughly!"
There's just an old electrical laboratory nobody wants to enter here.
"What do you think can be done?"
We built a farm together with our colleagues at MIT Media Lab. This place, until now, was known as a research institute for digital life rather than biology.
In this approximately 6 square meter space, we produced enough food for 300 people every month... It may not be a large amount...
There are many fascinating technologies being invested there, but.
What is the most intriguing among all that?
Beautiful white roots, vibrant green vegetables, and monthly harvesting.
Is this a new type of cafeteria?
New retail experience?
New grocery store?
There is is something I can say with certainty: this is the first time we've plucked something from the ground at the media lab.
The salad is in the bag, no problem there.
However, there are image processing experts, data scientists, robotics researchers who, while picking something from the root, "thinking 'I can do this with my knowledge', 'let's try it'". What would happen then?
We plan to keep the plants here in the lab before taking them outside. That's because we don't want to discard what we've grown; they're precious to us.
My taste buds are different - I'll taste it first myself. I won't let it to others until I'm sure it's a proper food.
So, I eat lettuce every day. The pH of lettuce can be determined within an error of 0.1.
"Oh, it's pH 6.1 today, I can't eat it."
The lettuce of the day was extremely sweet.
"When plants are stressed, they try to protect themselves, so chemical reactions occur internally, making them very sweet. 'I don't want to die.'"
That sweetness, like the cry of such plants, appeals to my preference for very sweet taste.
Scientists and technologists who have shifted to plant physiology...
The desire was to make others also able to perform this experiment.
What gets created is fascinating. So, I've been thinking about a lab that can deliver deliveries anywhere.
Firstly, I made it.
My lab is located on the front side of the Media Lab. About 30 sensors are attached to each plant.
If you're familiar with genomes or genetics, this is what we call the phenome.
The term "phenomenon" originates from this word.
For instance, if you say 'I prefer Mexican strawberries', it actually means you prefer strawberries that have grown in the climate where they taste the way you like them.
So, by, in essence, creating that climate in a program - concocting combinations of things like carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations into recipes to program plant flavors, nutrients, size, shape, color color, and texture.
This requires data, so I've attached numerous sensors to know the situation. Thinking about indoor gardening plants, it becomes very sad when you look at them. "Why are you dying? Talk to me."
Farmersers develop their most incredible predictive vision for plant growth, enhancing it from late 60s to early 70s.
When plants are dying, they understand the reasons - it's because of nitrogen deficiency, calcium deficiency, or they need moisture, etc.
This wonderful vision cannot be inherited.
This is data that one farmer has saved on the cloud.
Pursue the temporal changes of the data.
These data and the correlations with individual plants.
These are representations of broccoli in the laboratory on a particular day, depicted by IP addresses.
These are broccoli that can be assigned IP addresses.
(The applause) If you think it's still not strange enough, please click here to take a look at the profile of the plant.
These are downloadable data regarding the growth of plants mentioned earlier. They are likely more than what everyone imagines, not just when they can be eaten.
The times when they can obtain the nutrients they need.
Predict until the time it becomes to one's liking.
Are you watering too much?
Are you taking in too much sunlight?
It also emits warnings.
He speaks to me, he's intelligent, he shares a common language with me.
(The applause) I sometimes think of myself as the first Facebook user of the plant world.
That was about a plant's profile, and then that plant starts making friends.
Consuming less nitrogen, more phosphorus, and less potassium compared to other plants.
I believe it should work well. At present, all I can do is speculate. I've also learned about the complexity of relationships between plants.
Plants might not accept us as friends - but then again, it's possible. It depends on our actions.
This is my current lab.
I have slightly more order than before. I have experience in organizing data centers in various hospitals and know a bit about creating managed environments.
Then, I am trying all kinds of experiments under this environment.
This method, aeroponics, was was developed by NASA to transport water reduction for the meal space station into space.
Here, we provide plants with just the right amount of what they needs - water, minerals, and oxygen.
Root growth is simple, thriving beautifully when provided only what is needed.
It seems that plants have two hearts.
With two hearts, it grows four times or five times faster.
It's a complete world.
Humanity has been advancing technology for years to gain species that can grow in harsh environments. Technology reforms continue, yet now new methods have been produced. It's a complete world.
We have cultivated various types of plants.
This type of tomato had not been commercially produced for 151 years.
Do you know that humanity possesses rare and ancient seed banks?
It refers to the seed storage.
It's wonderful.
Reproductive material is stored alive, there are also species that nobody has ever tasted.
The only person who ate this tomato in the lab was me.
The problem is that this is a cooking tomato and I don't know how to prepare it. I tried eating a cooking tomato but, but it wasn't not tasty.
I've tried growing various things using proteins.
Humans too--it might be possible, but they're not actually doing it.
What I understand so far is that the equipment is large and very costly.
I wanted to spread it worldwide, but it became a device costing around 1 million yen.
Finding people who can quickly come up with 10illion yen is quite difficult, so I thought it would be better to make something smaller.
This project was was actually led by one of my students, Kamille, who is a college student studying mechanical engineering.
Kamille, we worked together, repeating experiments throughout the summer aiming for something cheaper, more functional, and something that anyone could make.
Next, I brought this to middle school and high school.
If you want to be laughed at by humans, try teaching something to a child.
"I went went to school and said, 'Set the humidity to 65%.'"
A first-year middle school student asks, "What's humidity?"
I replied, "It's about the water in the air."
He retorts, "There's no water in the air, you fool."
I would respond, "You don't have to believe me.
"YouYou don't have to believe me."
"Try setting it to 100%"
He set it to 110% - what happens then?
Water condenses, turning into fog, and eventually drops down as water droplets.
He said, "Wait, humidity is that thing related to rain, huh?"
"Why didn't you say that?"
"We created an input screen that feels like a game."
It's a 3D display. You can log in from anywhere around the world, on both smartphones and tablets.
You can operate various devices and sensors on the bot.
You can choose recipes made by other children around the world if you like.
When a recipe is chosen and activated, seedlings are planted.
During the growth period, changes can be introduced.
"Why do plants need CO2? Is it harmful? Could it kill humans?"
All sorts of words are said.
Raising the CO2 concentration causes plants to die.
Lowering the CO2 concentration makes plants very lively.
When the harvest of the plants is complete, new digital recipes are ready.
It's a process of iterating, developing, and exploring.
They can download the new plant data and new digital recipes they developed, and wonder if: were they effective effective or not?
Consider these as the core parts of the development process.
"We will learn a lot."
This is what we call Food Computers, three weeks in school.
In three weeks, it grows this much.
What might be even more significant is that this child for the first time considered whether they could become a farmer themselves, or perhaps even if they wanted to become a farmer.
Therefore, we have made all the data open.
Everything is online. Try assembling a food computer at home.
It might be a bit difficult, but...
It's an initial attempt, but everything is in place.
It is very important that many things are easily obtainable.
We will make it more down-to-earth.
They include farmers, electric engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, plant scientists, economists, and urban planners.
Performs one's expertise on a single platform.
"This lab has become cramped."
This is a new facility that I started using not long ago.
Such warehouses can be found found.
That's why it was chosen.
I am trying to make something like this in the warehouse.
This already exists.
Please see.
This also already exists.
They are cultivating each green vegetable and Ebola vaccine.
One reason these plants won the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Grand Challenge is because they were ahead in Ebola research. It's wonderful.
This plant produces a protein resistant to Ebola.
Extending from pharmaceuticals products to a lettuce.
This is exactly what I study, although it doesn't have anything to do with lettuce.
Everything is is different.
"We are still in the early chaotic state - kind of like 'our black box' - 'buy mine instead.'"
"It won't work, such valuable intellectual property is belongs to me."
"It won't work, buy mine."
In reality, it's just starting, and society is undergoing changes.
As demand rises for more affordable food, there is also a growing desire for higher-quality, environmentally friendly food.
The fact that McDonald's is disclosing what was considered the most suspicious ingredient in chicken nuggets at any time indicates that they they are adapting to the changes in the world and conducting marketing.
Let's take a look at the world today.
Personal food computers, food servers, and food data centers - they operate under an open phenome model.
Unlike an open genome, ours is more like a wiki with climate recipes added. You can start it by selecting from a dropdown menu and then grow it.
How does this endeavor look globally?
Is the world aware that it was connected by lines?
Firstly, install the oscillator.
Rather than sending the food itself, we will start by broadcasting information about food.
Not merely my imagination, but already spreading this kind of place.
Food computers, food servers, and food data centers also come into existence, connecting people through the sharing of information.
We are not fighting against the inherent flaws of future food supply.
I understand what the flaws are.
Future food supply is about a network connecting the next 1 billion farmers, and platforms provided enable the presentation of problems and provision of solutions 'if...'.
Thank you.
