Hello
Matthew Williams here. I am the champion.
I am winninging medals in the third sports event at the national tournament in Canada. In basketball, I participated in world-level matches and it was an honor to have played for Canada in the world championship.
(Aapplause) I practice basketball and speed skating for five days a week, and I'm supported by top coaches and a mental performance consultant to perform at my best during matches.
This is all about the Special Olympics.
Does hearing this change someone's's perspective on me or my achievements?
The world doesn't always see people like me as champions.
Until recently, people like me were marginalized and didn't appear in public.
Since the Special Olympics started in 1968, there have been significant changes, but in most cases, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible entities in the broad world.
No one thinks it's wrong for them to use derogatory language in front of me.
"YouUsing the word 'slow-witted' in a derogatory manner."
They don't consider how much damage it can do to me or my comrades.
Please don't think of me as an object of pity here.
I am here because there are still profound issues with the public's perception of people with intellectual disabilities, or rather, there is often nothing visible in too many cases, which is the problem.
Did you know that there was a world championship this year?
I was one of the 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities competing among 165 countries gathering in LA.
Over 62,000 spectators watched the opening ceremony, with sports TV stations TSN and ESPN broadcasting live.
Didn't you know about such a conference?
When you see someone like me, what do you think?
It's a challenge to all of you. Can you see us on equal terms?
The Special Olympics transforms the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and changes the values of all viewers.
If explaining for those who don't know, Special Olympics refers to events for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
They are separate from the Paralympics or Olympics.
High-level sports competitions are held throughout the year for people with intellectual disabilities, changing the lives and values of those involved.
With this, my life and the lives of many other people also changed.
And the eyes of the world seeing people with intellectual disabilities have changed.
I am born with epilepsy and intellectual disability.
I played hockey from a young age until I was 12 years old.
As I grew, it became increasingly difficult to keep up with everyone, making me feel left behind and frustrated.
For a while, I completely detached myself from sports. I didn't have many friends, and I felt left behind, which made me sad.
In the past, people with intellectual disabilities were hidden entities within society.
No one ever thought that someone could participate in sports or be a precious member of society just because they was able to do so.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist from the University of Toronto, began researching the impact regular exercise had on the physical abilities of children with intellectual disabilities.
The conclusions drawn by Dr. Hayden and other researchers through rigorous scientific methods state: "Low physical ability in children with intellectual disabilities is simply due to insufficient opportunities to engage in physical activity."
For individuals with intellectual disabilities, participation in sports programs and sports competitions can be beneficial.
Believers were few, but the pioneers - Dr. Hayden and the founder of Special Olympics, Yvonne Kennedy Shriver - did not give up, and the athletes have proven them right over 4.5 million times.
(Applause) Before I started participating in Special Olympics, I was worried. I was young, shy, lacked confidence, and had few friends.
But when I tried it, everyone encouraged me or supported me. There, I could be myself without worrying about what others think.
Nowadays, I am a basketball and speed skating player. I have participated in state and national tournaments, and this year I succeeded in attending the summer world championship held in LA - for the first time as a Canadian representative, advancing to the world championship as part of the basketball team.
(Applause) I am one of over 45 million athletes worldwide, and I've heard countless similar stories.
Through being Special Olympics athletes, we regain pride and dignity.
The Special Olympics also meets important health needs for athletes.
According to the research, the average lifespan of men with intellectual disabilities is 13 years shorter than that of non-disabled individuals, and for women, it's 20 years shorter.
But by moving our bodies and participating in competitions through the Special Olympics, we can maintain our health.
Additionally, the coaching staff teaches about nutrition and health.
In the Special Olympics, free health checkings are provided. The target is athletes who have difficulty communicating with doctors or those who medical care is hard to reach.
In the 2015 summer world championship, the team I was from, Canada, played against Nigeria's basketball team.
The day before the match, the Nigerian team underwent a health check at the venue, resulting in seven out of ten members receiving free hearing aids for the first time in their lives, allowing them to hear clearly for the first time.
(Aclamations) A remarkable transformation occurred in the athletes.
I enjoyed the matches more vividly, playing with confidence. That's because I could communicate my intentions effectively with the coach through voice.
Emotions were running high too, thanks to the sound of the ball becoming audible again, as well as the sounds of the trumpet and the cheers of the fans standing in the stands, which were sounds that should be heard for everyone.
Special Olympics athletes not only during competitions,
Life outside the stadium also changes.
According to this year's survey results, nearly half of American adults do not know anyone with a learning disability. About 44% of these people show significantly negative perceptions towards disabled individuals, indicating a very low level of acceptance.
Furthermore, this abundance of derogatory language use is evidence that intellectually disabled individuals still remain invisible to many people.
Everyone uses them casually or as vulgar expressions.
The number of tweets using the phrase "slow intelligence" last year was over 900 million times, but it's a very hurtful word for me and my fellow athletes, numbering over 45 million across the world.
Everyone doesn't't think it's an insult, but it's a mistake.
A colleague of mine, the Global Messenger John Franklin Stevens, wrote an open letter addressed to the notorious political commentator. It invited him to come to the Special Olympics someday.
"Please try to see if you can leave without being moved."
(AApplause) During the 2015 summer world championship, people waited for hours to come and watch the final day of the weightlifting competition.
In the midst of the crowd, my teammate Jackie Bullet, nicknamed 'The Big Moose of Newfoundland', lifted 295kg in the deadlift and 243kg in the squat - ( (Applause) - she significantly updated the highest record at the Special Olympics.
Jackie holds the record for weightlifting in Newfoundland, not just in the Special Olympics but among all weightlifting athletes.
In LA he became a big star, with ESPN broadcasting his new record live, moved by Jackie's achievements.
55 years ago, few would have considered that someone with a learning disability could do such things.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled that famous LA Memorial Coliseum. They came to witness the opening ceremony of the world championships and to cheer for the athletes gathering from 166 countries around the world.
"We were not just hidden figures, we were cheered for and celebrated."
The Special Olympics teaches athletes to gain confidence and pride.
It teaches the world to respect and accept people with intellectual disabilities.
(AApplause) I have achievements and dreams in competition, and I am fortunate to have great coaches. I hold respect and dignity, and I am healthier than before. I am aiming to become a personal trainer.
(AApplause) I'm no longer a hidden or bullied entity. I'm giving this TED talk right and now.
(AApplause) Thanks to the Special Olympics, the world has changed, but there's still a long way to go.
Please look at their person's abilities the next time you see someone with an intellectual disability.
If you come across someone who uses derogatory language, please teach them just how harsh those words can be.
And I hope you consider getting involved with the Special Olympics.
(AApplause) Lastly, I have one last word.
Nelson Mandela said, "Sport has the power to change the world."
The Special Olympics truly is transforming the world. For 4.55 million athletes are given a platform for rebirth, to gain confidence, make friends, not be seen through prejudiced eyes, to experience the feeling of being a champion, and actually become champions.
Thank you very much.
