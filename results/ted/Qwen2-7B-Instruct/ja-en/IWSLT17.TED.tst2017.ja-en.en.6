Sometimes, I feel extremely ashamed that I am a European.
In this past year, over one million people sought help and arrived in Europe. Our response, frankly, was quite poor.
It's really full of contradictions, you know.
Everyone mourned the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi, but since then, over 200 children have drowned in the Mediterranean one after another.
Acknowledginging the responsibility sharing on refugee intake under international cooperation, yet we are turning a blind eye to the fact that Lebanon, a small country, is receiving more refugees than the total number across Europe.
We lament the existence of illegal entry but have made it the sole escape route to Europe.
Excluding people who match economically and by population layers to labor demands from acceptance, despite labor shortage.
Opposing Islamic fundamentalism while proclaiming liberalism, yet at the same time, they are detaining young refugees, separating them from their families, and confiscating their belongings through repressive policies.
Don't you think it's strange?
Why have we come to adopt such inhuman responses to this humanitarian crisis?
I don't think it's because people are indifferent. I don't want to believe that is the reason.
I believe it's due to politicians lacking a vision. It's a vision for adapting the international refugee policy, established over 5 decades ago, to the changing globalized era.
I would like to return to basics and pose two fundamental questions that everyone should consider.
Firstly, why isn't the current system not functioning?
And how can we fix this?
The modern refugee system was something they people made right after the Second World War.
The very purpose is to provide a destination for people when states collapse or, in the worst case, point weapons at their citizens, ensuring they can live safely and with dignity until they can return.
It was created to prepare for situations like what we see in Syria today.
It is an international cooperation signed by governments of 141 countries - the 1951 Refugee Status Convention and through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( ensuring mutual acceptance of refugees in their own territories, providing refuge to those fleeing conflicts and persecution.
However, today, this system does not function.
Theoretically, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In reality, our immigration policies is blocking the path to safety.
Theoretically, refugees have the right to seek assimilation towards a place of refuge, and they should be able to return to their homeland.
In reality, it ends up being stuck in a dead-end almost forever.
Theoreticallyly, refugees have the right to seek responsibility sharing across the globe.
In reality, due to geographical issues, neighboring countries of conflict zones are taking in an overwhelming majority of the world's refugees.
The system is not functioning not because the rules are wrong,
Because we are not properly applying the rules to the changingable world, we should reconsider.
In this context, how does the current refugee system function?
Let me explain a little.
However, I will explain from the perspective of the refugee, rather than a top-down view from the system.
Firstly, imagine a Syrian woman.
Let's call her Amira.
She represents a multitude of people in that region.
Amira is just like 25% of the world's's refugees, she is a woman traveling with children. The reason she can't return home is because the city she lived in is now in such a state. As you can see, Amira's city, Homs, used to be a beautiful and historic city, but now it is buried under ruins.
It is not a situation where they can return.
However, there is is no option for Amira to resettle in a third country, as it's like a lottery; only 1% of the world's's refugees can achieve this.
Therefore, Amira and her family are left with almost impossible choices.
The basic options are three.
The first option is to enter a refugee camp with their family.
There, aid may be received, but there is little to no prospect for Amira and her family's future.
Refugee camps are harsh, barren lands - many are in the midst of deserts.
In the Zataari refugee camp in Jordan, gunfire can be heard at night near the border with Syria.
There are constraints in economic activities.
The quality of education is also not good.
And globally, among to the refugees housed in camps, approximately 85% will remain in this situation for at least five years.
Living there is miserable. Probably that's the reason why actually Syrian people choosing this path is only 9 percent.
There is is also the option of aiming for urban areas, such as Amman or Beirut in neighboring countries.
This option chosen by 75% of Syrian refugees is this.
However, they are faced with significant difficulties once again.
Refugees typically do not have the right to work in such urban areas.
The assistance is hardly received.
In this case, after Amira and her family exhaust their savings, almost nothing is left for them to face poverty in the city.
The third option - the number of Syrians choosing this is increasing.
For their families, grasping at a handful of hopes, risking their lives, embarking on extremely dangerous journeys, seeking other countries - this is the phenomenon being observed today in Europe.
This forces refugees to make such impossible choices, limiting their options to three: camp detention, impoverished city life, and perilous journeys.
For refugees, this is precisely what the international refugee system entails.
But I think this is the only option is a misconception.
I believe there is room for reconsideration.
The reason we limit refugees to these options is because we believe in our minds that there is only one path they can choose, but that is a mistake.
Politicians view the refugee issue as a 'zero-sum' problem â€“ meaning that if something is done for refugees, it is seen as a burden on citizens.
We often perceive refugees as burdens or a heavy load on society.
On the contrary, there are ways for refugees to contribute to society.
What I'm saying is that there are ways to expand the range of choices for refugees while ensuring everyone benefits - for the receiving countries and communities, our society, and the refugees themselves.
I believe that by discussing the four methods I will present, we can fundamentally change the way we think about refugees.
One common aspect among all four is methods that utilizes opportunities generated by globalization, mobility, and markets, thus changing our perspective towards the refugee problem.
The first idea is to prepare an environment for refugees, starting with a basic understanding that refugees are just ordinary people, merely in an abnormal situation.
I began researching refugee economic activities with my colleagues at Oxford University, starting in Uganda.
We chose Uganda not because it represents the world's welcoming countries.
That's because they are implementing a very good policy.
Unlike other welcoming countries around the world, Uganda has provided economic opportunities to refugees.
We gave refugees the right to work and freedom of movement.
With this, remarkable outcomes are being achieved, on both the part of the refugees and in refugee-hosting regions.
In the capital, Kampala, 21% of refugees own businesses and employ workersers, and 41% of those employed are citizens of the welcoming country.
That means refugees were creating jobs and employing citizens of the welcoming country.
In even refugee camps, splendid examples of active individual entrepreneurship could be observed.
For example, in Nakivale, a refugee settlement, Congolese refugees engage in the business of buying and selling digital music,
A Rwandan refugee had started a venture that provided refurbished gaming consoles and televisions for use by teenagers.
Despite the harsh environment, innovative initiatives are being carried out. This photograph features Demokai, a Congolese individual,
Upon arriving at the settlement, they was almost speechless, but they aspired to become a filmmaker.
He has opened a community radio station with friends and colleagues and now produces videos after borrowing a video camera.
We have jointly produced two documentary films at my team's request, successfully running the business with a small budget.
We should decide our response to refugees based on such examples.
We should not inevitably view refugee assistance as reliant on humanitarian aid, but we must provide opportunities for human flourishing.
Of course, clothing, bedding, places to sleep, food, etc., are all crucial in emergencies, but we must also look ahead.
Providing access to opportunities such as communication, electricity, education, labor rights, and access to capital or banks.
We must provide opportunities for refugees to benefit from the world economy, something that should be commonplace for us, and for refugees as well.
The second is an idea concerning economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all countries that accept refugees worldwide follow Uganda's approach.
Most countries do not welcome refugees in the way that Uganda does, integrating them into the economy.
However, feasible practical solutions do exist.
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, development economist Paul Collier. During my stay, we brainstormed and discussed with the international community and the Jordanian government on methods aligned with Jordan's domestic development strategy.
We came up with ideas on how to provide jobs to Syrians. It was about economic zones where we explored the possibility of incorporating refugee employment alongside the employment of Jordanian citizens in welcoming countries.
An economic zone exists just a 15-minute drive from the Zataari refugee camp where 83,000 people live, the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area.
The Jordanian government has invested over $100 million to connect this area to power supply networks and road networks, but however, two things are lacking: labor force and internal investment.
If here, could refugees work? If not confined to the camp, able to support their family, learn skills through vocational training, then acquire a skill, and then return to Syria?
We considered this beneficial for Jordan, as part of its development strategy as an upper-middle-income country requires growth in the domestic manufacturing sector.
This is beneficial for refugees as well, but it also contributes to rebuilding Syria after conflicts. It aims to make refugees the best human resources for rebuilding Syria - this is based on the recognition that protection and nurturing of refugees is necessary.
Upon publishing this proposal in the political magazine "Foreign Affairs",
The attention of King Abdullah stopped at
At the Syria support conference held two weeks ago in London, it was announced that a pilot program will be implemented this summer.
(The applause) The third idea I would like to propose is is a matching system between countries and refugees, leading to outcomes like this photograph here, where a Syrian refugee is taking a selfie with Chancellor Angela Merkel.
There isn't often a chance to ask refugees about hope or destinations. But, there is plenty they can gain while listening to the voices of refugees.
The concept of matching theory, developed by economist Alvin Roth, decides the final combination based on the preferences of the parties involved.
Colleagues Will Jones and Alex Taietebouim have been exploring ways to apply this concept to refugees. They asked refugees to list their desired destinations in order of preference, and at the same time, requested that welcoming countries prioritize the types of refugees they want, assigning priorities based on factors such as job skills and language. This method involves matching both parties.
Well, of course, when considering the criteria for intake quotas, elements such as diversity and vulnerability should be taken into account. However, these can also be considereded as methods to improve matching rates.
The concept of matching is effectively utilized, for example, in university admissions slots for students, kidney donors and patients, and is also incorporated in algorithms used by dating sites.
How about incorporating this to expand the options for refugees?
We can also use it at a domestic level. One of the major challenges we face is getting the local community to accept the integration of refugees.
Currently, for example, in my country the UK, we often foolishly send farmers to the countryside and technicians to the city.
Therefore, by conducting market matching, we can align both parties' wishes, and hear the needs or demands from the residents receiving refugees and also from the refugees themselves.
And the fourth idea is humanitarian visas.
Most of the tragedies and chaos happening in Europe can be entirely avoided.
The fundamental contradiction in Europe's refugee regulations is the cause. To put it simply, in order to become an asylum seeker in Europe, one must arrive on such perilous journeys without prior preparation. But, why are such voyages necessary?
And yet, despite the availability of budget airlines and improved diplomatic services in this era, such journeys are unnecessary. Last year, over 3,000 people lost their lives making these journeys, at European borders and within Europe.
It's a straightforward solution: if refugees were allowed to travel normally to Europe and become asylum seekers, this could be avoided. A method to achieve this is called humanitarian visas, which can be obtained from embassies or consulates in neighboring countries. And simply, one can pay for the journey themselves by taking ferries or flights to Europe.
Using smugglers to travel from Turkey to Greek islands costs 1,000 euros.
A low-cost airline ticket from Bodrum to Frankfurt is 200 euros.
There are significant benefits to giving refugees such options.
If many lives were spared, the refugee smuggling industry would flourish, and chaos would fade away from the frontline of European islands like Greece.
The hindrance to such means is not a reasonable strategy but the policy itself.
This idea has actually been implemented.
Brazil pioneered this approach, allowing over 20,000 Syrian refugees to obtain humanitarian visas and enter Brazil, and immediately gaining refugee status upon arrival.
All Syrians who have utilized this system have obtained refugee status and have formally been recognized as refugees.
There are precedents historically.
During the years of 1922 and 1942, utilizing the Nzecen Travel Document as an international identity certification, 450,012 Assyrians, Turks, and Chechenss moved within Europe and submitted asylum applications in other countries within Europe.
The NZecen International Office for Refugees was received the Nobel Peace Prize for this practical strategy that was acknowledged by society.
All four of the four ideas presented here expand the options available to the hypothetical refugee Amira mentioned at the beginning.
This is a way to broaden the range of choices for refugees. There's no need to limit it to the three free options we discussed initially; instead, it benefits others as well.
In conclusion, what we need is a new vision - one that understands that broadening the options for refugees doesn't not necessitate a heavy burden.
The idea that refugees inevitably become a burden is is incorrect.
While a humanitarian obligation, refugees are capable individuals with skills, talent, and enthusiasm. Provided with opportunities, they possess the power to contribute to society.
In the future, there will be no end to people migrating around the world.
What is happening in Europe will continue for many years to come.
Refugees movement continues, searching for a place to settle. To address this situation rationally and realistically - rather than relying on outdated theories of humanitarian aid or notions of charity, we should look towards methods that utilize opportunities generated by globalization and market liquidity.
I want to appeal to all of you, and especially to the politicians, wake up and face this issue.
Thank you.
