"Hello everyone"
"My name is Matthew Williams, I am a champion."
"I have won medals in three different sports, including the Canadian Commonwealth Games. I have participated in international-level basketball events, and I am very proud to represent Canada on the world stage."
"I train basketball and speed skating with top coaches and performance psychologists for five days a week to maintain optimal竞技 condition."
To add, all these achievements are due to the Special Olympics.
Has this changed your perception of me and my accomplishments?
This world doesn't't treat all people like me as champions.
Not too long ago, people like me were not well-received.
Since the inception of the Special Olympics in 1968, this situation has improved significantly, but there is still often a tendency in reality for individuals with intellectual disabilities to be overlooked compared to the general population.
People call me "stupid" in my face, thinking I wouldn't care.
They call me "foolish" and say I am slow-witted, using the term in a purely negative manner.
They don't realize how much this hurts me and my friends.
I don't want you to think I'm here seeking pity.
I am here because this issue still exists: there are ways people perceive individuals with intellectual disabilities that are problematic, or, more so, many simply do not acknowledge their existence.
Do you all know that the World Games were held this year?
"I am one of the 6,500 intellectually disabled athletes from 165 countries competing in Los Angeles."
At the time, over 62,000 spectators watched the opening ceremony, and it was was broadcasted live by TSN and ESPN.
Do you all know about this thing?
"When you see someone like me, what do you think?"
"I came here today simply to boldly advocate for us to be treated equally."
The Special Olympics has transformed the self-perception of intellectually disabled athletes and altered the audience's perspective.
"If you're not familiar with the Special Olympics, let me explain: it's designed for individuals with intellectual disabilities."
It stands independently from the Paralympics and the Olympics.
We have high-quality, year-round athletic programs specifically designed for athletes with intellectual disabilities, which can change our destinies and how we are perceived.
The Special Olympics has changed my life, as well as many others', and has also transformed how the world perceives individuals with intellectual disabilities.
I was born with epilepsy and intellectual disability.
Before I was 12 years old, I played ice hockey.
The more I grew up, the harder it became to keep up with others; I felt angry and discouraged.
For a while, I didn't engage in any sports activities. I had few friends, feeling abandoned and overlooked.
For a period, individuals with intellectual disabilities were segregated from society and not publicly acknowledged.
No one would think they could participate in sports, let alone become a valuable member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the impact of regular physical activity on the health of children with intellectual disabilities.
Dr. Hayden and other researchers, through rigorous scientific research, reached a conclusion: the reason for the decline in the health of children with intellectual disabilities is simply a lack of opportunities for physical activity.
Many question whether individuals with intellectual disabilities can benefit from sports programs or athletic competitions.
But it was Dr. Hayden and Special Olympics founder Eunice Kennedy Shriver who insisted on the benefits of sports, and Special Olympic athletes have proven time and time again, more than four hundred fifty thousand times, that sports do indeed have benefits.
Before I participated in the Special Olympics, I was a nervous person due to my youth, shyness, lack of confidence, and few friends.
But when I got there, I found everyone was friendly, helpful, non-judgmental, and allowed me to be myself.
Now, I am a basketball player, also a speed skater, having competed at provincial and national levels, and this year, I participated in the Summer Special Olympics in Los Angeles, representinging for Canada's first-ever basketball athletes in world competition.
I am one of these four hundred fifty thousand athletes around the world, and I've heard many similar stories.
Being an athlete for the Special Olympics helps us regain confidence and dignity.
This运动会also highlights significant health needs.
Research indicates that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities live 13 years less than those without, and women with intellectual disabilities live 20 years less than those without.
The Special Olympics keep us healthy and encourage us to actively engage in sports.
Our coaches also taught us about nutrition and health.
The Special Olympics also provide free health check-ups for athletes who may have difficulty communicating with their doctors or who lack access to healthcare.
At the 2015 Summer Special Olympics, my Canadian teammates and I faced off against the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the competition, members of the Nigerian basketball team participated in the Special Olympics' health system check-up. Among the ten players, three received free hearing aids for the first time, allowing them to hear more clearly.
The changes they bring are truly remarkable.
They were more excited, happy, and confident because their coaches could finally communicate with them using.
They were easily excited, because they they could hear the sound of the basketball, the whistle, and the cheers of the fans standing beside them - the sounds we take for granted.
The Special Olympics don't just transform athletes in terms of sports.
It transforms them in aspects of their lives as athletes.
This year, research shows that nearly half of American adults know no one with an intellectual disability, and 44% of Americans who have not interacted with someone with an intellectual disability are notably more intolerant and less positive in their attitudes.
Then, the use of words containing "stupid" indicates that individualsswith intellectual disabilities are still overlooked and feel isolated from the world.
People use this word either casually or as an insult.
Last year on Twitter, it was used over nine million times, deeply affecting me and my four hundred fifty thousand athlete companions around the world.
People don't think it's an insult, but it is.
My fellow athletes, also known as global ambassadors Franklin Stevens, wrote a letter to a political commentator who had once used the word "retard" to insult someone, "Come see the Special Olympics one day,"
"See if your views have changed by the time you leave."
This year, at the 2015 Summer Special Olympics, people queued for hours just to watch the last night's of weightlifting.
When my teammate Jackie Barrett stepped up to compete, everyone stood up in admiration; he was known as the "Newfoundland Moose", lifting 665 pounds in the deadlift and 611 pounds in the squat, setting multiple new records for the Special Olympics.
Jackie holds the records for Newfoundland's weightliftersers not just for Special Olympics athletes, but for all weightliftersers.
Jackie is now a big star in Los Angeles, with ESPN tweeting about his record-breaking feats in weightlifting and being amazed by his performance.
F5 years ago, few could envision what individuals with intellectual disabilities could achieve.
This year, sixty thousand spectators filled the famous Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to witness the opening ceremony of the event and cheer for athletes from 165 countries around the world.
We were celebrated and cheered, not hidden away.
The Special Olympics teach athletes to be more confident and proud of themselves.
The Special Olympics also teach this world that people with intellectual disabilities are deserving of respect and inclusion.
Now, in my athletic career, I have dreams and achievements, good training, respect, a healthier lifestyle, and I'm also working towards advancing in the field of personal training.
I am no longer hidden or bullied; I am here at TED giving a TED Talk.
With the Special Olympics, the world is different, but there's still a long way to go.
So next time you see someone with an intellectual disability, I hope you see their potential.
Next time someone uses the word "retard" around you, I hope you tell them how hurtful it is.
I hope you would want to see a Special Olympics event.
I'd like to share one last idea with you.
As Nelson Mandela once said, "Sport has the power to change the world."
The Special Olympics are transforming the world, impacting over four hundred fifty thousand athletes, giving us a place to belong, empowering us to gain confidence, make friends, not be discriminated against, and experience the thrill of being champions.
Thank you everyone!
