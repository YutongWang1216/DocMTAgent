I come from one of the most free, tolerant, and potentially prosperous cities in the United States, Seattle in Washington.
I grew up in a wonderful Seattle family.
My mother is an artist, and my father is a university professor; I am deeply grateful for their nurturing, as I am able to freely and confidently shape my life according to my own judgment.
In reality, my choices were different from what my parents might have envisioned.
At nineteen, I dropped out of college - or, more accurately, was expelled.
I embarked on the path to become a professional horn player, a dream that had been my lifelong aspiration.
I performed chamber music across the US and Europe, touring for years with excellent jazz guitarist Charlie Bird.
In my twenties, I was thrilled to join the Spanish Barcelona Symphony Orchestra.
What a wonderful life!
And my parents never complained.
They have always supported me throughout.
Even if it wasn't not their dream.
They used to tell their neighbors and friends, "Our son is going to 'take a break' for ten years."
And there's also an awkward conversation about my life that I want to share with you.
At that time, I was 22, I returned to Barcelona from home, that day was Christmas, I went back to visit my parents, when I was helping my mother cook dinner at that moment, there were only us two in the kitchen.
She was silent, saying nothing.
I felt something was off.
I asked my mother, "Mom, what are you thinking about?"
She said, "Your father and I are really worried about you."
I was surprised: "What? What are you worried about now?"
She replied, "I hope you will honestly answer my question: Did you vote for the Republicans?"
The truth is, I'm not particularly interested in politics; I'm just a French horn player.
But I understood a bit, they sensed something, so they were somewhat confused.
At that time, I became a fervent capitalist, let me tell you why.
Regardless of whether you believe it or not, it stems from my lifelong research on poverty.
In Seattle when I was still a child, I remember that being the first time I encountered genuine poverty.
My family belonged to the lower middle class, but it was certainly not true poverty.
Not at all.
I first witnessed the true face of poverty in the early 1970s, when I was was only six or seven years old.
Like many of us, this example is quite common and ordinary.
That was a picture from National Geographic, depicting a child in East Africa, around my age, with flies buzzing on his face and a swollen belly.
I knew he wouldn't make it, I knew, but I could do nothing.
Perhaps among of you remember a similar picture, not exactly the same but quite alike.
It showcased to the Western world the unbearable poverty that exists elsewhere in the world.
That image lingered in my mind as I grew up, went to school, dropped out, and began to build my own family.
I wonder what happened to that child later on?
Or how those like him are faring in the rest of the world?
I started investigating this issue, even though I was no longer in college, still seeking answers: what had happened to the poorest people in the world?
Worse or better? How did it turn out in the end?
I eventually found the answer and transformed my life. I wish to share this with you all.
Actually, most Americans feel that way from childhood, since they've seen that scene.
Poverty has worsened. If you ask Americans: "Is the global poverty problem more severe or has it improved?" 60% would say that hunger issues was been more severe since the early 1970s.
However, the truth is this.
This was a moment that changed my perspective and brought clarity to me.
Since 1970, the percentage of the population living on less than $1 per day, in constant 2010 purchasing power, has declined by 80%.
Since I was young until now, the percentage of the world's poorest people has decreased by 80%.
And yet, I was am unaware of this truth.
My friends, this is a miracle!
This is something we should celebrate.
This is the greatest achievement in the fight against poverty in human history, and it is happening in our lifetimes.
Upon realizing this fact, I wondered, what makes poverty alleviation possible?
Because if you don't know the cause, it will just be a fleeting moment.
We aim to replicate this success, lifting out of poverty the two billion people still struggling, because that was has been our conversation for as long as I can remember - the two billion poorest, our brothers and sisters, escaping poverty.
I hope to save the remaining two billion, so I must know the reason.
I sought for the answers,
It's not a political answer, because I really don't care about political solutions.
Now, still indifferent.
I sought out the best answers from mainstream economists, regardless of whether they be from left-of-center, right-of-center, or centrist economists.
Below
I will now delve into specific reasons.
Since childhood until now, lifting 2 billion people out of poverty.
There are five reasons. First: Globalization.
Second: Free Trade
Third: Property Rights
Fourth: Rule of Law
F: Entrepreneurship
These are the free free market system that swept the globe after 1970.
I am not naive.
I acknowledge that the free market economy is not perfect, and I also understand that the free free market economy does not fulfill all our needs to build a better world.
It is remarkable.
And it transcends politics.
This is one thing I've learned and come to realize.
Capitalism is more than just capital accumulation.
Its brilliance lies in its association with ambition, a point made by many on this stage, an ambition born of dreams, rooted in the free market system.
We must make more people understand this.
Now, let me talk about my second realization, which is connected to the first one. I believe it not only promotes global development but also our nation's's development.
Summarizing the just-discussed views on alleviating poverty with a single quote: "Free markets have created the most wealth in history."
"And lifting millions of people out of poverty."
Whose quote?
Like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan's.
Wrong!
It's President Barack Obama!
Why do I remember this so vividly?
Because he was speaking to me.
Surprised, aren't you?
At the time, I said, "Hallelujah!"
Not only that, but I also said, "What a splendid opportunity."
Do you know what I was thinking back then?
In May 2015, we conducted an event at Georgetown University about the topic we were working on,
At that moment, I thought about a solution to the biggest problem facing America today. What was could that be?
It's about bringing together libertarians and conservatives to discuss these ideas and help those who need us the most.
Without me saying so, each and every one of you knows that we are in peril, not just for the United States, but for other politically divided nations around the world,
This issue is pressing.
This couldn't help but cause concern.
Last year, an article was published in one of the most influential and cutting-edge science journals in the West, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
That was an article from 2014 about asymmetric political motives.
What is it? Psychologists describe this phenomenon as assuming that your thoughts are grounded in love while the other person's thoughts are grounded in hatred.
This is quite common in international disputes.
For example, between Palestinians and Israelis.
The author of this article discovers that in contemporary America, a sizable portion of Republicans and Democrats differ in their political motivations.
Today, the majority of politically active individuals in our country believe they are motivated by love, whereas the rest are driven by hate.
Think about it.
Most people would say, "My ideology is founded on kindness; I want to help people, while the other side, they're evil, they want to bring me down."
Societies with such divisions cannot progress.
This is impossible.
How do we address this issue?
Firstly, let us face the reality: there are differences.
We cannot diminish the differences, for that would be childish behavior.
There is considerable in-depth research on this matter.
My friend Jonathan Hett is a regular at TED.
He is a psychology professor at New York University.
He studies the differences in people's's thoughts, values, and moral views, examining what sets them apart.
He demonstrated that conservatives and liberals have very different perspectives on what they consider important.
For example, Jonathan Hett showed that libertarians cared about poverty 59 percentage points more than they did about economic freedom.
Conservatives care about economic freedom 28 percentage points more than they do about poverty.
Seemingly irreconcilable differences, don't they?
Can we not come together? No!
Our strength lies precisely in our differences.
Remember what ended poverty:
It is the obsession and focus on the issue of poverty, and the free economic order across the globe.
We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people, to help another two hundred million people escape from poverty.
There is no other way.
Well.
What should we do about it?
It's a delicate matter, isn't't?
We need to innovate our thinking.
Many innovative ideas are on this stage.
Yes! That remarkable societal entrepreneurial spirit.
We need to invest overseas in a sustainable, responsible, and ethical manner.
But do you know what it is that we truly need?
We need to open up new horizons with flexible thinking,
We need less of the predictable,
Are we right?
Have you ever felt that your thoughts were becoming predictable?
Are we starting to become predictable?
Have you ever felt yourself always listening to those who share your views?
Why is that dangerous?
Because when we talk about the economy in this country, it's the conservatives who are always discussing taxes, rules, and big government.
On the other side, it's the liberals, who when talking about the economy, it's always about income inequality.
Yes? Those are indeed important, important to me, important to you as well.
But when those who are starving need our help, these are just distractions.
We should unite behind the best methods to reduce poverty as much as possible, only when conservatives recognize that they they need the liberals' concern over poverty, and the liberals also require the conservatives' zeal for the free market.
We shall succeed. Only by choosing this path will this diversity give birth to the powerful forces that will shape the future nation.
How do we achieve this goal? How can we work together towards it?
I have some practical suggestions for you, and for myself.
First principle of action: Always remember, merely tolerating others' differing opinions is not good enough,
Insufficient by far.
We must remember that we need those who disagree with us, because there is a group of people who require help from all of us, and they are still waiting.
What are you going to do about it? How are you going to show it?
Where to start? Right here!
Everyone present, we are all fortunate.
We have those who listen to us,
We are successful, we have leadership.
When people hear our ideas from an unknown ideology, perhaps then alone will make them listen to us.
Perhaps this is where success begins.
This is the first point. Second.
The second point: I am asking you, and myself, to become a specific individual with blurred boundaries, to be a vague, hard-to define person.
If you're a conservative, then be a conservative who often talks about poverty issues, and a warrior upholding the moral obligation to fight for the poor.
If you're a liberal, then be a liberal who often lauds the allure of the free market run responsibly.
If we do that, both goals are within reach.
First, we embark on the task of helping the next 2 billion people, just as we have done so many times before, addressing their problems effectively. And in the future, we will tackle even more. This is what we are capable of achieving.
The second is that we might be able to overcome this terrible ideological war that has afflicted us, turning it into a contest of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
Perhaps, just perhaps, by then we might discover that the supposed divisions we claim to have are not as intractable as we think.
Thank you!
