When I was at university, I studied political science, which meant I had to write many essays.
When a regular student writes an essay, they might do it like this, by dividing the task among themselves.
So, you see, it might start off slow, but by the end of the week, you've written quite a bit, and sometimes more, and eventually everything is sorted out, nothing gets messed up.
I want it to be like that.
At least, that's how my plan was.
I was ready to start, yet, in reality, when it came to writing papers, this is what I did.
And every time I wrote a paper, it was like that.
At last, when it came to writing the 90-page graduation thesis, which should have taken a year to complete.
I knew that my usual approach wouldn't work for such a paper.
The graduation thesis is a major project.
So I planned, deciding to do it this way.
The year's's tasks were thus arranged.
At the beginning, do a little bit, then gradually increase the amount of work for a few months in the middle, and then then push yourself to work at full capacity towards the end, like climbing a series of small steps.
How difficult can climbing a series of steps be?
There's nothing too serious, right?
However, interestingly enough, something intriguing occurred next.
At the beginning of those first few months?
In and out, I basically didn't do much.
So came up this fantastic revision plan.
And then... those middle months just slipped by, and I barely wrote a word, so here we are.
Then it was two months down to one month, and then down to just two weeks.
Then one day, I suddenly realized that there were only three days left until the deadline, and not a single word had been written. Thus, I did the only thing I could do: in 72 hours, I wrote 90 pages, pulling all-nighters shifts for two days straight. People should not stay awake for two nights in a row. I rushed through campus at full speed, sneaking in slow motion, and submitted the thesis before the deadline.
I thought that was was it.
As a result, a week later, I received a call from the school.
They asked, "Are you Tim Urban?"
"I say, 'Yes.'"
They said, "We need to talk to you about your thesis."
I replied, "Yes."
The speaker continued, "This is the best thesis we've ever seen."
(The applause continues) But that didn't happen.
This paper was is extremely poorly written.
I just wanted to bask in this moment when everyone thinks, "This guy is amazing!"
Not this one, that paper was was terrible.
Regardless of how it turned out, I am now a blogger.
I wrote a blog post about "pursuing until the bottom of the pot".
A few years ago, I decided to write an article about procrastination.
My procrastination behavior often confuses those around me who do not procrastinate, so I want to explain to non-procrastinators what goes on in a procrastinator's's mind, and why we procrastinators behave this way.
My hypothesis is that the brains of procrastinators and non-procrastinators are different.
To prove this point, I found a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI lab where I could scan my own brain and one proven to be non-procrastinator's's brain, then I could compare these two brains.
Today, I brought them all here.
I hope everyone can carefully compare whether there are any differences between the two.
I know that none of you are trained neuroscientists, so it might not be immediately obvious, but let's take a look at it, shall we?
This is a non-procrastinator's's brain.
Now,
This is my brain.
There is a difference between these two.
Both brains have a rational decision-maker, but in the procrastinator's's brain, there's also a monkey called instant gratificationment.
What does this mean for the procrastinator?
It means that everything was before the event occurred was quite alright.
[This is the best time to get started.] [Not at all!] So when the rational decision-maker makes a rational decision to do something productive, the monkey doesn't want to do that, and thus he takes control of the steering wheel and says, "Actually, let's read about the Nancy Kerrigan/Tonya Harding scandal on Wikipedia because I just remembered this thing.
Then, let's go to the fridge and see if there's anything new since those ten minutes.
Afterwards, let's continue browsing on video platforms, starting with Richard Feyn's video on magnetism, and watch until we reach at an interview with Justin Bieber's mother, exploring endlessly.
"Everything takes time, so unfortunately, our schedule today doesn't allow us to get things done."
Sorry!
What's going on here?
Immediate gratificationation for the monkey doesn't seem like the kind of thing you'd want them to be in control of the steering wheel for.
He lives completely in the present.
He has no past, no future, and he only cares about two things: simplicity and happiness.
In the animal world, this is fine.
If you were a dog, living simply and happily through your life would already be a huge success!
For the monkey, humans are another kind of animal.
Sleep well, eat enough, and reproduce the next generation; perhaps this worked was fine in the era of tribes.
However, if you haven't noticed, we are not living in the era of tribes anymore.
We are in an advanced civilization, while monkeys have no idea what that is.
This is why there is another fellow in our heads - the rational decision-maker - enabling us to do things that other animals cannot.
We can anticipate the future.
We can keep an eye on the big picture.
We can make long-term plans.
And he wanted to take all of this into consideration.
He wants us to do anything that's worth doing right now.
Sometimes simple pleasures are meaningful, like eating, sleeping, or enjoying deserved leisure time.
This is why there's an overlap between the impulsive satisfaction of the monkey and the rational decision-maker.
Sometimes they agree.
However, at times, it is more meaningful to do those harder, less enjoyable things out of consideration for the bigger picture.
This is when the conflict arises between the two.
For the procrastinator, each conflict ends this way: he spends a lot of time in the orange area, which is the simple and enjoyable but meaningless one.
I refer to this area as the dark playground.
The dark playground is a place that all procrastinators are familiar with.
This is where leisure activities take place when they should not be resting.
The pleasures obtained in the dark playground are not true happiness, for they are entirely undeserved. This leads to feelings of guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-hatred - emotions that are common among procrastinators.
And the problem is, in this scenario, with the monkey at the wheel, how can procrastinators be led to the blue area, where it might not be as comfortable but, but there are many important things to do?
Actually, the procrastinator has a guardian angel, always looking down upon him and keeping watch over him, during those darkest moments it is called the Panic Beast.
The Panic Beast spends most of its time hibernating, but when deadlines are nearing, or when there's a risk of public humiliation, or facing career disasters, or when there are other terrifying consequences, it would suddenly wake up.
And importantly, he was the only thing the monkey fears.
Recently in my life, the Panic Beast has become quite significant, because TED staff reached out to me six months ago, inviting me to give a talk.
Certainly, I've agreed.
I had always dreamed of giving a TED talk.
(The applause) But amidst this excitement, the rational decision-maker seems to be pondering something else.
He would say, "Are we clear on what we just agreed to?"
Do we now possess the capability to undertake the task that we will face in the future?
"We need to sit down and get to work."
The monkey would say, "Absolutely, but let's open Google Earth and zoom down 200 feet beneath India's's surface. Then spend two hours and thirty minutes scrolling upwards to its surface, so we can better appreciate India."
That day, I did just that.
As the timeline shortened from 6 months to 4, then 2, and finally 1 month, the TED staff began to announce the speakers.
I opened the website to see my own face staring back at me.
Who do you think woke up at this moment?
Then the Panic Beast went berserk, and within seconds, the entire system was in chaos.
And the monkey, remember? He feared the Panic Beast, and with a pop, he climbed up the tree!
Thus, finally, the rational decision-maker could take control of the steering wheel, and I could begin preparing for this speech.
To the Panic Beast, all those rather silly procrastination antics, such as me spending two weeks unable to start my thesis introduction, then miraculously bursting with incredible work enthusiasm, staying up all night to crank out eight pages.
The entire scenario, along with these three roles, constitutes the system of procrastinators.
Not pleasant, but at least it serves a purpose.
This is what I decided to write on my blog a few years ago.
After the release, the responses surprised me greatly.
I received thousands of emails from people around the world, doing all sorts of different things.
There were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and many, many PhD students.
The content is pretty much the same: "I have this problem too."
What struck me was the contrast - the casual tone of the post versus the weighty nature of those emails.
These individuals feel a strong sense of defeat, as procrastination impacts their lives, and the monkey controls their thoughts.
After reflection, my question becomes: If the system of a procrastinator can function, then what's the issue?
Why do these people all have such dark corners?
I realized there were actually two types of procrastination.
The examples I've discussed today, as you've seen, all have deadlines.
When there is a deadline, the impact of procrastination is confined within a shorter period as the Panic Beast interveneses.
For the second type of procrastination, it occurs in the absence of a deadline.
For instance, if you're thinking about starting your own business or pursuing artistic endeavors, there might not be a deadline initially, because nothing will happen until you actually start putting in the effort, no momentum building to keep things moving forward.
Beyond career pursuits, there are important matters without deadlines, such as visiting family, maintaining physical health through exercise, making efforts to improve relationships with partners, or ending unsatisfying ones.
If procrastinators were to tackle these difficult tasks using only the mechanism of the Panic Beast, then the question arises: because, because in the absence of deadlines, the Panic Beast simply wouldn't manifest.
He has no time to wake up, so the consequences of procrastination are unbounded; they just get pushed further and further without end.
This prolonged procrastination, unlike its more engaging, shorter-term, deadline-driven counterpart, is less evident and less frequently discussed.
It typically influences us quietly and subtly.
It could be a source of extended periods of unhappiness, guilt.
I believe that's why those people sent emails, that's why they're in such a terrible state.
Not because they were frantically working on a project,
Instead, this prolonged procrastination makes them feel like they are sometimes just observers in their own lives.
Their disappointment isn't because they can't realize their dreams; it's that they can't even begin to chase after them.
So after reading these emails, I had a realization that I believe there are no non-procrastinators.
Indeed, I believe everyone is a procrastinator.
Perhaps you're not like us, all over the place, maybe some people can handle deadlines well, but please remember: the most devious trick of the monkey lies in the part without deadlines.
Now I want to show you one last thing.
I call it the Life Calendar.
Assuming a person can live to 99 years old, each week is a box.
Actually, there aren't not many boxes left, especially considering how many years we've already lived.
I think we all need to take some time to really look at our Life Calendars.
We need to seriously consider what it is that we're truly procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating on something.
We must always be aware of the presence of this monkey seeking instant gratification.
This is something that everyone should do.
And since there aren't not many boxes left, perhaps this task should have started today.
Well, maybe not today, but...
You know what I mean.
Not too far in the future.
Thank you.
