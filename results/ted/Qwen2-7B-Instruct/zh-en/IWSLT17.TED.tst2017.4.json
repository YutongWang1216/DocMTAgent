At 12, they felt unjustly pressured to take responsibility for their actions amidst this perceived end. Initially skeptical, they turned to reading \"Left Behind\" for guidance. The priest led a midnight prayer session, with the congregation divided and certain members receiving VIP seating. The experience was marked by a mix of suspense, longing for redemption, and a fallback plan in anticipation of the end's arrival. Separately, the author contemplates their relationship with the older generation, particularly their devotion to prayer and the Baptist faith. These individuals, once young farm workers in East Texas, now express their devotion with deep emotion and fervor. The author sees them as idols, yearning to join them spiritually, yet struggles with the complexity of faith and the potential for misunderstanding or deception. They acknowledge participating in the same practices, highlighting their own struggle with the authenticity of their beliefs. The author feels disillusioned regarding the older generation's unwavering faith and their own role in perpetuating these beliefs.",

        "new_src_summary": "在1999年12月31日，大卫·布鲁克斯在德克萨斯州的一个简陋教堂中度过了其生命中的最后一个夜晚，与人群一同等待基督复临，预感到世界即将迎来末日，这段经历充满了对救赎的渴望、内心的焦虑与对公平性的质疑，反映了作者对宗教信仰的深刻理解及对即将到来的责任感。通过回忆这一事件，布鲁克斯反思了个人信仰与对未来责任的思考，这段经历也揭示了代际之间的差异，展现了他的叙述风格，情感丰富且带有幽默元素，例如对“浸会资产阶级”的的称呼。同时，这段文本还揭示了信仰、家庭关系和自我认同的深入探索。\n\n布鲁克斯在其回忆录《道德论》中分享了自己在信仰、生活和职业道路上的挣扎与反思。他最初坚信耶稣会多次降临人间，但后来意识到这一观念可能基于对时间的不同理解，这让他感到困惑和痛苦，但最终他接受了“不相信也是可能的”这一信念。这一转变引发了他对信仰和真理的质疑，认识到过去坚信的答案可能是错误的，而现实中的问题本身也可能存在谬误。\n\n通过描述自己在不同人生阶段（如大学、实习、做记者等）的经历，布鲁克斯展现了他在面对挑战、困境和失败时的挣扎与成长过程。这些经历包括被抢劫、目睹金融危机、政治理想破灭等，强调了教育、工作和政治并不能完全解决问题。尽管面临种种困难，布鲁克斯仍然保持乐观，认为每个人的生活故事都可能在某个转折点上发生改变，即使是在看似绝望的情况下。这种态度体现了对个人力量和可能性的信念。\n\n整体而言，这段文段属于自传体文学，风格深情且反思深刻，通过作者个人经历探讨了信仰、真理、个人成长以及社会现实等多个层面的主题，语气既包含情感的深度又不失理性的思考。",
        "new_tgt_summary": "In reflecting on their youth, the author recounts attending church on New Year's's Eve 1999, believing the world would end due to Jesus' supposed return, which led them to feel unjustly pressured to take responsibility for their actions. Initially skeptical, they turned to read \"Left Behind\" for guidance during a midnight prayer session where left the congregation divided, with certain members receiving VIP seating. This experience was marked by a mix of suspense, longing for redemption, and a fallback plan in anticipation of the end's arrival. Separately, the author contemplates their relationship with the older generation, particularly their devotion to prayer and the Baptist faith. These individuals, once young farm workers in East Texas, now express their devotion with deep emotion and fervor, which the author sees as idols, yearning to join spiritually, yet struggles with the complexity of faith and the potential for misunderstanding or deception. The author acknowledges participating in the same practices but highlights their own struggle with the authenticity of their beliefs, feeling disillusioned regarding the older generation's unwavering faith and their own role in perpetuating these beliefs. Reflecting further, the author shares personal experiences, including plunging into a baptismal pool twice, and their belief transformation over time, questioning their faith and understanding that answers may be flawed and that believing doesn't guarantee salvation or overcoming personal challenges. The author seeks relief from hardships through education, employment, and political change, only to find these solutions insufficient, leading to a sense of disillusionment and the realization that no single solution can guarantee resolution to life's's complexities.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, reflectinging on their youth, recounts attending church on New Year's's Eve 1999, where they believed the world would end due to Jesus' supposed return, leading to a mix of suspense, longing for redemption, and a fallback plan in anticipation of the end's arrival. This experience marked a turning point in their relationship with the older generation, particularly their devotion to prayer and the Baptist faith. The author contemplates their own struggle with faith, participating in practices like baptism while acknowledging their own struggle with the authenticity of their beliefs. They question their faith and understand that believing doesn't guarantee salvation or overcoming personal challenges. Seeking relief from hardships through education, employment, and political change, the author eventuallyally found these solutions insufficient, leading to a sense of disillusionment. During a winter party, the author and friends embarked on a cross-country road trip, inspired by a desire to explore the country and its people. This adventure, completed in 2013, covered 13,000 kilometers, visit diverse locations and interact with local businesses. Inspired by this experience, the author founded \"MBA Across America,\" a non-profit organization aimed at empowering entrepreneurs and healing societal divisions through grassroots initiatives. Reflecting on the journey, the author gained new insights and perspectives, observing the pride and wealth accumulated by influential figures. Despite of the road trip and the subsequent formation of MBA Across America, the author's's view of the American Dream has fundamentally changed, now seeing its potential for positive social change.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "Reflecting on their youth, the author recalls attending church on New Year's's Eve 1999, during which they believed the world would end due to Jesus' supposed return, leading to a mix of suspense, longing for redemption, and anticipation of the end's arrival. This experience marked a turning point in their relationship with the older generation, particularly regarding their devotion to prayer and the Baptist faith. The author also shares their struggle with faith, participating in practices like baptism while acknowledging their own struggle with the authenticity of their beliefs. They question their faith and understand that believing doesn't guarantee salvation or overcoming personal challenges. Seeking relief from hardships through education, employment, and political change, the author eventuallyally found these solutions insufficient, leading to a sense of disillusionment. Inspired by a desire to explore the country and its people, the author embarked on a cross-country road trip in 2013, covering 13,000 kilometers, visiting diverse locations, and interacting with local businesses. This experience led to the founding of \"MBA Across America,\" a non-profit organization aimed at empowering entrepreneurs and healing societal divisions through grassroots initiatives. The author gained new insights and perspectives, observing the pride and wealth accumulated by influential figures. Despite the road trip and the subsequent formation of MBA Across America, the author's's view of the American Dream has fundamentally changed, now seeing its potential for positive social change. Additionally, the author reflects on visiting a city farm in Harlem, New York, run by Tony, aimed at providing meals for impoverished children. This encounter highlights stark inequalities in society, leading the author to question the effectiveness of current systems and advocate for fundamental changes. The experience prompts a realization of being part of the problem rather than a solution, reflectingenting on past beliefs about suffering as a divine gift and the need to reassess faith in societal structures.",
