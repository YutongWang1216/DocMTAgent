Sometimes, as a European, I feel very ashamed.
In the last year, over a million people arrived in Europe needing our help, and how did we respond? Frankly, it was lamentable.
There are too many contradictions here.
We mourn the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi, but since then, over 200 more children have drowned in the Mediterranean.
We have international conventions recognizing the responsibility of states to accept refugees, yet Lebanon, a small country, is taking in more Syrian refugees than all of Europe combined.
We denounce the existence of human smuggling, yet we have made it the sole viable option for those seeking asylum in Europe.
We face labor shortages, yet we prevent those who could meet our economic and demographic needs from entering Europe.
We proclaim that our liberal values are at odds with the Islamist fundamentalists' beliefs, yet—through our harsh policies of detaining child asylum seekers, separating children from their families, and forcibly confiscating refugee property.
What are we doing?
How did we get to this point? We are responding to a humanitarian crisis in an inhumane way.
I don't believe it's because people don't care, at least, I don't want to believe that so.
I think this is due to our politicians lacking foresight, lacking understanding of how to adapt to a world that has been changing and globalizing for half a century.
The international refugee system, so what I'd like to do is step back and ask two very basic questions - questions that we all need to understand.
Firstly, why doesn't the existing system work?
Secondly, how do we address it?
The modern refugee system was was designed after World War II, by these people.
Its purpose was to ensure that, should a country collapse or worse, the government is hostile to its people, those people would have somewhere to go where they could live safely and with dignity until they could return home.
This is precisely what we see today in Syria.
Through the International Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, signed by 14 governments at a conference in 1951, and an international organization, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR, committing to allow people from other countries to enter their territories to escape conflict, persecution, and violence within member states.
But now, the system is breaking down.
Theoretically, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In reality, our immigration policies is blocking the path to safety.
Theoretically, refugees have the right to seek equal treatment or the option to return to their home country.
But in practice, they are stuck in a kind of indefinite stasis.
Theoretically, the responsibility for refugee issues is shared among all nations.
In reality, geographical location means that countries bordering conflicts bear an overwhelmingly disproportionate burden of hosting refugees.
The existing provisions of the refugee system were not the cause of its collapse.
Rather, it's about how we haven't sufficiently leveraged the changes in the world - something we need to reconsider.
Therefore, I hope to explain to you how the current system operates.
How the current refugee reception system operates.
Rather, this is from the perspective of the individual refugee, not a top-down, macro-level approach.
So, imagine a Syrian woman
We'll call her Amira for now.
Amira represents many refugees I have encountered in this region.
Amira, like one-quarter of the world's refugees, is a woman with children; she can't go home because her city, the beautiful and historically rich city you see here, Homs, is now devastated.
Therefore, Amira cannot return.
Similarly, Amira has no hope of resettling in a third country, as that is akin to winninging the lottery; less than one percent of the world's refugees have a chance to do so.
So, Amira and her family face a nearly impossible choice.
They have three basic options.
The first option is for Amira to take her family to a refugee camp.
In the camps, she might receive assistance, but the prospects for Amira and her family are bleak.
The camps are situated in desolate, barren areas, typically within deserts.
At the Zaatari camp in Jordan, you can hear the sound of artillery shells crossing the Syrian border at night.
The economic activity there is restricted.
Education quality is typically quite low.
Furthermore, around eighty percent of refugees in camps worldwide are required to stay there for at least five years.
This is a bleak place, which might also explain why in reality, only nine percent of Syrians have chosen this option.
Alternatively, Amira could go to a city, a district in a neighboring city, such as Amman or Beirut.
Seventy-five percent of Syrian refugees opt for this choice.
But even there, it's fraught with challenges.
Refugees within cities usually do not have the right to work.
They typically lack access to aid channels.
So when Amira and her family depleted their basic savings, they were left with little, likely facing poverty.
The third option, increasingly chosen by Syrians.
Amira can seek hope for her family, embarking on a perilous journey that may cost lives, to another country, which is is what we see today in Europe.
Worldwide, we present refugees with an almost impossible choice among these three options: refugee camps, urban poverty, and perilous journeys.
For refugees, this system is is the current global refugee system.
But I think this is a wrong choice.
I believe we can reconsider this choice.
The reason we limit these options is that we believe these are the only options available to refugees, but fact, they they not.
Politicians frame it as a zero-sum game: if refugees benefit, then citizens must bear the cost.
It seems that we accept a premise that refugees are an inevitable burden and cost to society.
This is not a one-way street; refugees can make contributions.
So what I want to argue is that there is are ways to expand that option and still have it be beneficial to everyone involved, including the host countries and communities, our societies, and the refugees themselves.
I would like to propose four avenues to shift our established perceptions on refugees.
These four avenues share a common thread: we all leveraged globalization, social mobility, and market opportunities to reshape our understanding of the refugee issue.
I would like to start by considering the concept of creating environments, which stems from a fundamental understanding that refugees, like everyone else, are simply individuals placed in specific circumstances.
My colleagues and I at Oxford University embarked on a research project in Uganda, focusing to explore the economic lives of refugees.
We chose Uganda not because it represents the prototypical receiving country.
It is precisely an exception.
Unlike most host countries around the world, Uganda provides economic opportunities for refugees.
Grant them the right to work, give them freedom of movement.
The outcome is astonishing, whether for the refugees or the host countries.
In the Ugandan capital, Kampala, we found found that twenty-one percent of refugees run their own businesses, employing others, and forty percent of those employed are nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees are creating jobs for the citizens of the host country.
Even within refugee camps, we have found examples of dynamic, thriving entrepreneurial ventures.
For instance, in a camp called Nakivale, we found found Congolese refugees running a business trading digital music.
We found examples of Rwandan refugees running businesses where young people can play computer games on repurposed consoles and monitors.
Breaking through extreme constraints, refugees are constantly innovating. You face a Congolese man named Damon Kai.
When he arrived to the camp, he had nothing but his desire to become a filmmaker.
So, together with friends and colleagues, he founded a community radio station. He rented a camera, and now he's making films.
He has already directed two documentaries, and with our team, for our team, starting with scarce resources, he has built a successful career.
It is precisely such examples that should guide our response to refugees.
Rather than assuming refugees inevitably rely on humanitarian aid, we need to provide them with opportunities to achieve human flourishing.
Absolutely, essentials like clothing, blankets, shelters, and food are critical during emergencies. But we must also think ahead.
We need to provide internet access, electricity, education, the right to work, funding, and business avenues.
All the avenues we take for granted to access the global economy should be made available to refugees.
The second idea I'd like to discuss is the Economic Zone.
Unfortunately, not all host countries around the world adopt Uganda's policies.
Most host countries do not open their economies to refugees, but we still have viable alternatives.
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, development economist Paul Collyer, where we discussed an idea alongside international actors and local governments. The idea was to bring employment opportunities for Syrians while also advancing Jordan's national development strategy.
The idea is to establish an economic zone where we can combine the employment of refugees with that of Jordanian nationals.
Just a 15-minute drive from Zaatari refugee camp, which houses 83,200 refugees, lies an operational economic zone known as King Hussein Development Area.
The government has invested over $1 billion to connect power grids and roads, but however, two critical components are still lacking: labor and foreign investment.
So what if refugees could work there instead of being trapped in camps, able to support their families before returning to Syria, equipped with skills gained through vocational training?
We recognize that this approach would benefit Jordan, which seeks to upgrade manufacturing as part of its national development strategy as a middle-income country.
This approach benefits refugees while also aiding post-war reconstruction in Syria, by recognizing the need to develop refugees as the best resource for rebuilding the country.
We published this perspective in the journal Foreign Affairs.
King Abdullah of Jordan also embraced this notion.
Two weeks ago, at the London Syria conference, it was announced that the pilot project would start this summer.
The third idea I want to illustrate is the alignment of preferences between states and refugees. To achieve this satisfying outcome depicted in the selfie, the picture features German Chancellor Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee.
We don't often ask refugees what they want or where they wish to go, but I advocate for doing so, benefitingting everyone involved.
Economist Alvin Roth created the concept of matching markets, where the order of preferences between two sides determines the final match.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Tetebolin have been researching how to apply this concept to the refugee issue, asking refugees to rank countries based on their preferences, while also allowing states to rank the types of refugees they would like to receive, based on criteria such as skills or language. These rankings are then matched together.
Certainly, you need quotas for diversity and vulnerability, but this is a way to increase matching possibilities.
This matching concept has been successfully applied, for instance, to match students and universities, donors and patients, and it also highlights the significance of algorithmic rules in dating websites.
So why not use it to give refugees better options?
This principle can also be applied at the national level, where the main challenge we face is convincing local communities to embrace refugees.
At present, for example, in my country, we often send engineers to remote areas and farmers to cities, making no sense.
So matching markets provide a potential avenue for aligning these preferences and reflecting the needs and demands of both host-country populations and refugees.
My fourth idea is humanitarian visas.
The majority of the tragedies and chaos we see in Europe could have been avoided.
This stems from a fundamental contradiction in European asylum policy: to seek asylum in Europe, you must arrive in Europe on your own journey, one that I described as perilous earlier. But why are these journeys necessary?
In an era of budget airlines and embassies?
These are completely unnecessary journeys. Last year, over three thousand people died making these trips, at European borders and within Europe.
If refugees could directly travel to Europe and seek asylum, we could avoid these deaths, and indeed, this is possible through humanitarian visas, which allow individuals to obtain visas at their neighboring countries' embassies or consulates, pay for their own passage, and arrive in Europe by cruise or airplane.
It would cost around one thousand euros to smuggle an illegal immigrant from Turkey to the Greek islands.
It would only cost €200 fly budget airlines from Bodrum, Turkey, to Frankfurt, Germany.
If we allowed them to do so, it would yield tremendous results.
This would save lives, eradicate the market for illegal smuggling, and eliminate the chaos we see on Europe's periphery, such as in the Greek islands.
The reason hindering us from implementing this solution is politics, not rational ones.
And this is an idea that has already been put into practice.
Brazil was was first to implement this policy, over 2,000 Syrian refugees were granted humanitarian visas to enter Brazil and apply for asylum upon arrival.
In that plan, every Syrian received refugee status and was confirmed as a genuine refugee.
There is a historical precedent.
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nani passports served as travel documents, allowing 451,013 Assyrians, Turks, and Chechenss to cross Europe and apply for refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
The International Refugee Organization, established under Nani, received the Nobel Peace Prize for this viable solution.
So the four ideas that I'm presenting to you are ways that we can expand Amira's options.
Allow refugees to have better options beyond the three basic, unfeasible choices I've mentioned before, while still benefitingting everyone involved.
In summary, we need a fresh perspective to expand the options for refugees and recognize that they do not necessarily have to be a burden to society.
Refugees don't have to be a cost.
Indeed, refugees are our humanitarian responsibility, but they are also human beings with skills, talents, and aspirations who can contribute to society - if we allow them to.
In a new world, migration will not disappear.
The scenes we observe in Europe will will persist for many years to come.
People will continue to migrate, and people will still uproot their homes; we need to find a rational and pragmatic way to manage this - not through the old logic of humanitarian aid, not through the logic of charity, but through the opportunities brought about by globalization, markets, and mobility.
I hope everyone recognizes this, and I beseech our government officials to rise to this challenge.
Thank you all.
