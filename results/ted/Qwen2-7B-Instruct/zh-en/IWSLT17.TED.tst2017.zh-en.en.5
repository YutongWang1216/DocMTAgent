Food crisis.
Appear in daily news.
What is that?
In some parts of the world, there is a scarcity of food, while in other places, there is abundant food production.
In some places, genetically modified foods saved the world.
Perhaps genetically modified foods are a problem?
Too much genetically modified agricultural waste created polluted oceans, toxic seawater, and nutrient-poor environments.
This cycle continues in this manner.
I find that today's's discussions simply lack impact.
How can we make such discussions understandable to everyone?
How about the apple food crisis?
I'm sure that each and every one of you has eaten an apple in the past week.
"How long do you think it takes for an apple to go from being picked to reaching your hand?"
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months - this is the average time from picking to sale for apples sold in US supermarkets.
I think it's about the same in Europe as it is worldwide.
"We pick the apples, store them at refrigerated storage, input oxygen into the cold storage - in fact, there are documented cases where workers tried to enter such an environment to retrieve an apple, then died, because the air in the cold storage, which is toxic to humans, when one is inside."
Why none of you knew about this?
Why didn't I know about this?
90% of the nutrients in apples - all the antioxidants in apples - are lost when we purchase them.
It's just a small candy.
Why don't we know about these things? How can we improve this situation?
I think we're lacking a platform.
I'm familiar with platforms - I use computers, and I've been active online since I was was young.
I've done many strange things on platforms like this.
And yet, I have also encountered others, where I am able to express my thoughts.
What do you think about food?
If we had a platform, perhaps we would discover how advantageous this issue is "what if?"
I wonder: If climate were democratic?
This is a map of global climate distribution.
The most efficient agricultural production areas are green, while the worst are red.
They keep shifting, moving, California farmers now become Mexican farmers.
China acquires land in Brazil to grow better food, we are all slaves to the environment.
If each country had its own climate-suited agriculture?
How would that change our lives?
How would that change our lives and the quality of nutrition?
The challenge for the previous generation was more food, and at lower prices.
Welcome to the World Farm.
We built a massive simulated farm.
These lineings - representing cars, airplanes, trains, and vehicles.
Providing enough food for 7 billion people is a miracle, one that occurs under circumstances where only a few participate in the food-making process.
However, if...
Should we build a digital farm?
The Digital World Farm.
If you could take this apple and, to some extent, digitize it, transmit it via air particles, and then reassemble the particles on the other side?
"If?"
Look at those quotes, you know, they kind of inspired me to do this.
The first point: "Japanese agriculture lacks young people, water, land, and future." This was what I found when I arrived in Sanriku Town, just south of Fukushima, after the nuclear power plant disaster.
Children moved to Sendai and Tokyo, with farmland contaminated by the nuclear power plant accident, and their import food consumption reachinging 7 70%.
This, however, is not a phenomenon unique to Japan.
Only 2% of the American population is involved in agriculture-related work.
What answers do the 2% of people engaged in agriculture provide us?
Let's look at other places in the world, where 50% of the African population is under 18 years old.
八十 percent of them are unwilling to become farmers.
Agriculture is too arduous.
Farm life is too laborious.
They choose to go to the city.
In India, where farmers' families struggle to access basic farming equipment, the number of farmers taking their lives exceeds that of the past decade.
It's so sad to talk about these things.
Where are they going?
Go to the city.
Without young people, all the young ones have gone to the cities.
How should we construct a platform to encourage the youth?
Please see this new tractor.
This is my combine harvester.
A few years ago, I visited home improvement stores to start looking for tools.
I've made stupid things I've got plants dancing and hooking them up to my computer and then smashing them - lots.
I eventually managed to keep them alive.
I forged the closest relationship of my life, as I learned the language of plants.
I want them to grow bigger.
They say, "Child, give it your all!"
This unused electronic studio.
"What can you do?"
Working together with team members, we set up a farm within the Media Lab—a space traditionally associated with the digital life rather than biology.
In this 60-square-meter space, we created enough provisions to feed approximately 300 people for a month—nothing extravagant.
There are many interesting technologies here.
The most intriguing question?
Beautiful, white stems, deep green plants, monthly harvests.
Is this a new-style restaurant?
Is this a new-style sales experience?
Is this a new-style store?
What I can confirm is that this is the first time a plant has been uprooted in its entirety within the Media Lab.
We bagged the salad; nothing wrong with that.
But what happens when you have a computer vision expert, a data scientist, a robotics expert, pull up a plant and think, "Well, I know about -- I can make plans come true, I want to try."
Throughout the process, we would take the plants out and then bring some back to the lab, because if you've grown it yourself, you wouldn't just throw it away; because it's precious to you.
I now have this strange tongue, because I don't want anyone before me to eat them, I hope they are delicious.
I eat lettuce every day, I can tell you that the pH level of lettuce is below 1.
"Now, this is me, no, that's 6.1 -- no no, you can't eat it today."
(Aapplause) That lettuce was very sweet that day.
That's because lettuce feels immense pressure, it produces chemical reactions internally to protect itself. "I don't want to die!"
The taste of a plant's fear of death is sweet.
Scientists have returned to studying plant physiology.
I think everyone can try to participate.
We look forward to seeing everyone's creations, hence we envision a lab that can be transported to other locations.
Bring this conception into reality.
The front facade of this Media Lab building is my laboratory, with every plant having 30 sensing points.
If you're familiar with genomics or genetics, this is the phenome, right?
The phenomena presented by the phenome.
When you say, "I like strawberries from Mexico," what you really like is the strawberries produced under such climatic conditions.
You can encode such climates -- how much CO2, how much oxygen created -- recipes you can program to control the state of the plants, and nutrient content, size, shape, color, and texture of the plants.
We need data, so we placed many sensors to provide us with data.
You can think back to the plants at home, watching the plants at home feeling sad because you're thinking, "Why did you die? Would you talk to me?"
Farmersers have the most beautiful eyes, capable of foreseeing the future, when they're in their sixties and seventies,
They can tell you that the plant died due to nitrogen deficiency in the soil, calcium deficiency, or because it needed a more humid environment.
These beautiful eyes will not be passed down.
These are the eyes of farmers.
We will continue to gather data information.
We combine these data points with individual plants.
These are the IP address data of all the cauliflower in my lab that day.
We have cauliflower with trackable IP addresses.
(AApplause) If that's not strange enough, you can click here to see the plant's profile.
This shows you the downloadable growth process of that plant, not just when it's edible, notifying you, but as you might imagine.
When does its nutrient level meet my needs?
When does its taste meet my expectations?
Is it too much moisture?
Is it too much exposure to sunlight?
They will all prompt.
It can converse with me, communicate, and we can have a dialogue through language.
(Applause) I think that was was the first user of Plant Facebook?
At that point, the plant's profile would see the plant starting to make friends.
I'm being serious - plants will start befriending those using less nitrogen, more phosphorus, and fewer potassium.
We will begin to understand those complex things, those things we can only guess at now.
They might not be friendly towards us - I don't know, maybe they will be, depending on our actions.
This is my lab now.
This is a bit more systematic, given my background in designing hospital data centers, I know how to create a controllable environment.
So... in this environment, we experiment with all sorts of things.
This program, aeroponics, was something that NASA developed for the International Space Station to reduce the amount of water they need to send up there.
The function of this program is to accurately provide plants with what they want: water, minerals, and oxygen.
The roots aren't that complicated, when you feed them these things, you see amazing effects.
Plants has two hearts.
Because of having two hearts, it exhibits a 4-5 times faster growth rate.
This is a perfect world.
We have undergone a long technological evolution, seeking a different world, and we will continue to do so, but we will also have new tools, this will be a perfect world.
We cultivate a variety of things.
These tomatoes have not been commercially cultivated for the past 15 years.
Do you know we have rare, old seed banks?
Seed banks.
This is great.
They have living germplasm, food you haven't tasted.
I am the only person in this room who has eaten this type of tomato.
The issue is, this is sauce tomatoes, we don't know how to cook with them, so we perceive sauce tomatoes as not being delicious.
But we've grown all sorts of protein-rich things.
We have grown humans - maybe you can, but we can't.
We realize that the tools are too big and too expensive.
I began placing them worldwide, worth roughly $100 million.
Finding individualsswith disposable income of $10 million is not easy, so we aimed to create smaller tools.
In fact, this is a project of one of my students - Cameron, an undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering.
Cameron and I, along with my team, spent the entire summer experimenting to make it cheaper, to make it work better, and to teach others how to use it too.
Then we send these tools to schools for kids aged 5 to 11.
If you want to become humble, try teaching children what to do.
I went to this school and said, "Set its humidity to 65%."
A child in 5th grade asks, "What humidity?"
And I said, "Oh, it's the water in the air."
He said, "There is isn't water in the air, you fool."
So I said, "Alright, don't believe me."
Actually - don't believe me, okay?
Set it to 101.
He set the humidity to 101, what happened then?
Condensation begins, producing fog, eventually leading to dripping.
Then he said, "Ah, humidity is rain."
"Why didn't you tell me this before?"
The interfaces we created look like games.
They have 3D environments, allowing login from anywhere in the world, from phones and computers.
The program consists of different sections - physics adjustment, sensors.
They chose recipes created by children in other parts of the world.
They select and activate recipes, planting seeds.
As the seeds grow, the children can make changes.
They ask, "Why do plants need carbon dioxide? Isn't carbon dioxide bad?
"It could be suffocating."
Increasing the supply of carbon dioxide, and the plants die.
Decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide, plants thrive well.
Harvesting plants, you create new digital recipes.
This is a process of iteration, development, and exploration.
They can download all the data of the new plants they have developed, or the new digital recipes - what did it do? Better or worse?
Imagine these as processed individual components.
We can learn a lot.
This was a Food Computer, one we've placed in a school for three weeks.
This is three weeks of planting.
Most importantly, this is the first time, this child believes he can be a farmer - or, he wants to be a farmer.
So we open-source these resources.
Put it all online; go home and try building your first food computer.
It's going to be hard -- I'll tell you that.
We're still in the early stages, but the resources are all there.
For me, making this accessible is is incredibly important.
We will continue to do so as well.
These are farmers, electronic engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, botanists, economists, urban planners.
On one platform, doing what they excel at individually.
The team has grown too large.
This is my new experimental equipment, it's starting to operate.
This warehouse can be built anywhere.
This is the reason I chose it.
In this warehouse, we will build structures like these.
Now you can see.
Take a look at this,
This also exists.
One grows green vegetables, the other grows Ebola virus vaccines.
Greatly contributing to our success in researching Ebola, plants and this US Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (winning project are the key components of our studies.
These plants are producing proteins against the Ebola virus.
So medicines and supplements, all the way to lettuce cultivation.
But these two things look completely different, which is what I do within my own domain.
But many things aren't as you imagine.
We're still at the "we're right" stage, like, "This is my little black box..." "No, buy mine."
"No, no, no - my intellectual property is absolutely worth it."
"Don't buy this, buy mine."
In fact, we are just at the beginning stage, where society is also undergoing changes.
"When we want more, cheaper food, we now need higher-quality, environmentally-friendly food."
But when you see McDonald's advertising the ingredients of its McChicken, the most mysterious food in human history - McDonald's marketing campaigns are changing - everything is changing.
Now take a look at the world today.
Personal food computers, food servers, food data centers, showcasing phenotypic operations.
Like open genomics, but we're compiling tiny climate recipes, like Wikipedia, where you can overturn, edit, and grow.
How does this look?
Do you remember that the world is connected by fine threads?
Bacon is starting to appear.
We began sending messages about food, rather than distributing it.
This isn't not just a fantasy, but it's what we're already working on.
Food Computers, Food Servers, soon to be Food Data Centers, connecting people to share information.
The future of food is not its fight with errors,
We all know where the fault lies.
The future of food is about connecting the next billion farmers, and empowering them through through a Q&A platform, "What if?"
Thank you.
