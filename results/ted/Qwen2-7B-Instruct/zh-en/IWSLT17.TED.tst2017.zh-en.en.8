When I moved to Harare in 1985, issues of social justice were at the core of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
After the new government emerged from a long civil war, it immediately announced a socialist policy making healthcare services and primary education virtually free.
Massive rural health centers have made it possible for 80% of the population to reach one within walking distance of two hours - a truly remarkable advancement.
In the year of Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, 22% of children received routine vaccinations.
By 1990, just a decade later, this proportion had risen to 80%.
I am honored to be part of this transformation, this revolution.
Excitement and comradeship were genuine.
Working shoulder-to shoulder with outstanding Zimbabweans, scientists, doctors, activists, I feel part of not just an African liberation struggle, but a progressive global public health movement.
I have faced daunting challenges.
In 1980, the year I arrived, Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS case.
In the early 1980s, I had seen several AIDS patients while undergoing medical training at Harlem Hospital, but... we never imagined encountering anything like this in Africa.
When I arrived there, the infection rate was around 2%.
This proportion rapidly increased, when I left Harare 18 years later, one in four adults were infected.
By the mid-1990s, I had told hundreds of vibrant young people that their HIV tests were positive.
I witnessed colleagues and friends dying, as did my students and hospital patients.
Facing this situation, my colleague and I opened a clinic.
We demonstrate how to use condoms.
We promote awareness in schools and workplaces.
We conduct research, providing advice on how partners of HIV-infected individuals can protect themselves.
We worked very hard at all of this, and I believe that at the time I was doing everything I could.
I provided the best treatment possible under the circumstances at that time.
However, I did not make constructive changes.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan had once candidly acknowledged that it was his personal failure that led to the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was the head of the UN peacekeeping department.
At the ten-year memorial ceremony for the genocide, he recounted how he believed he had done everything possible at the time, but it was was only after the genocide that I realized there were so many things that I could have done and should have done, to raise the alarm and seek support.
The outbreak of AIDS caught medical organizations off guard. The World Health Organization estimates that three million nine hundred thousand people have died from this disease today. Many, like myself, feel regret and sorrow for not having been able to prevent it sooner.
But when I lived in Zimbabwe, I didn't realize I was an advocate or a political figure.
I thought I was going there because to my medical knowledge, due to my clinical and infectious disease research.
I always felt that my job was to care for patients, through research to better understand the characteristics of the population affected by the virus, and I hoped to slow its spread.
I realized that the proportion of marginalized groups infected and dying of AIDS was alarmingly high.
In sugarcane plantations, these places more akin to feudal domains than modern enterprises, 60% of pregnant women tested positive for HIV.
My role is to demonstrate to people that being infected is not a moral failing, but it is related to machismo and tied to forced labor and colonialism.
The majority of whites remained unscathed.
As medical experts, our approaches are sadly inadequate: we plead with individuals to alter their personal behaviors, to use condoms, and to reduce the number of sexual partners.
The infection rate continued to rise, as treatment, while effective as our most powerful weapon against the virus, was unaffordable for the entire African public sector when it became feasible in Western countries.
I did not venture to assert that the inequity in access to life-saving medicines, or the issues within potential economic and political systems, were the driving forces behind such high rates of infection across such large populations.
I justified my silence by reminding myself that I was merely a visitor in this country, and sounding the alarm might lead to deportation, hindering my ability to do my work, care for my patients, and conduct the critical research that was needed.
So, I did not boldly criticize the government's early HIV policies.
I did not express my concerns loudly enough.
Many doctors and health workers might feel that I have not gone too far.
Our commitment to our patients is sacred and inviolable, akin to the Hippocratic Oath and its various iterations, forming the foundation of the doctor-patient relationship.
I gave my utmost to every patient.
Yet, I know that the infectious diseases that arise from the fractures in our society reflect more than just biological phenomena; they are reflections of exclusion, intolerance, racism, gender bias, and class discrimination.
Regarding HIV/AIDS so much,
Regarding the recent Ebola outbreak as well.
Medical anthropologists, such as Paul Farmer, who works on HIV/AIDS in Haiti, refers to this as structural violence. Structurally, because inequality is rooted in the political and economic organization of our societies, often ignored by those in power and privilege; violently, because its impacts, like premature death, suffering, and disease, are violent in nature.
We have done little for the sick if we are not aware of these social injustices.
Ringing the alarm bell is the first step in guiding public health in the right direction, this is how we seek support, to break through and create genuine ways of change.
So now, I am no longer silent.
I've been outspoken on many matters, though it may be uncomfortable for both the listener and myself.
Much of this has to do with apartheid and organized racism - things that should not have happened in this country, things that should not exist in medical practice or in public health.
However, they do exist, at the cost of shortened lives.
This is why the echoes of racism's toll on public health resonate in America, continuously fueled by institutionalized, interpersonal acts of violence against people of color, deeply intertwined with our tragic history - 255 years of slavery, 91 years of segregation, 61 years of inadequate attempts at equality. It is my work as Commissioner of Health in New York City that focused on these alarms.
In New York City, the premature mortality rate, or dying before the age of 65, was 55% higher for Black individuals compared to White individuals.
In 2012, black women faced over 10 times the risk of death related to pregnancy compared to white women.
Despite the significantable progress we've made in reducing infant mortality, the birth-to-first-year mortality rate for Black infants is is still nearly three times that of White infants.
New York City is not an exception.
These statistics are similar across the entire United States.
A recent New York Times analysis reports that there are approximately fifteen million missing black men across the nation.
The author points out that among, among, between the ages of 25 and 54, at least one in six black men has been lost to the shadows of daily life, incarceration, or premature death.
Young black people face disproportionately high levels of violence on a daily basis, which is incredibly unjust, all encapsulated in the recent protests waving the "Black Lives Matter" banner.
However, we must remember the state of ordinary medicine and its outcomes, along with the persistent and disproportionately high rates of illness - heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS - the diseases that quietly and slowly consume lives, taking more black lives prematurely.
As the "Black Lives Matter" movement unfolded, I felt frustrated and angry, hesitant and reluctant within medical institutions, in my research, and even in the use of the term "racism."
Every time I say it, you probably already feel it.
Medical students in their white coats, marching to protest chemical weapons, yet medical establishments largely stand idly by the ongoing effects of racial discrimination on health conditions and mortality rates.
I'm concerned that the trend towards personalized and precise medications, seeking biological and genetic targets for better-designed therapies, might inadvertently distract us from the bigger picture - the everyday scenes where one lives, grows, works, and loves, profoundly impacting population health for many of us, ill-health.
Living our daily lives, as healthcare workers, whether in clinics or conducting research, we bear witness to immense injustices. We see the homeless, unable to follow medical advice, prioritizing more pressing matters; the young transgender, planning suicide, due to society's cruelty; the single mother, compelled to feel responsible for her child's ill-health.
As healthcare professionals, our role is not just treating our patients but but sounding the alarm and advocating for change.
And regardless of its validity, our social positions lend credibility to our voices, and we should not squander it.
I am remorseful for not being forthright about this in Zimbabwe. I have committed to myself, as the Health Commissioner of New York City, to utilize every opportunity to sound the alarm and advocate for health equity.
I speak out against racism, and I hope you will join me, and I'll join you when you speak out against sexism, or any form of inequality.
It's time for us to stand together against structural inequalities - to speak out boldly.
We don't need to have all the answers to advocate for change.
All we need is courage.
Our patients' health, our own health, depends on this.
