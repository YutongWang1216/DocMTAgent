        "new_tgt_summary": "Matthew Williams introduces himself as a champion who has won medals in various sports, including basketball and speed skating, representinging Canada internationally. He credits his achievements to the Special Olympics, which he believes has transformed perceptions of individuals with intellectual disabilities. Despite progress since the Special Olympics' founding in 1968, Matthew notes that people with intellectual disabilities are often overlooked and subjected to derogatory language. He clarifies that he's not seeking pity but wants to raise awareness about ongoing issues in societal perception. Highlighting his participation in the World Games, an event attended by 6,100 intellectually disabled athletes from 165 countries, he invites others to consider their thoughts when encountering individuals with intellectual disabilities.",

Despite progress since the organization's inception in 1968, Williams observes that people with intellectual disabilities continue to be overlooked and subjected to derogatory language. He highlights his participation in the World Games, an event attended by 6,100 intellectually disabled athletes from 166 countries, and encourages others to reflect on their thoughts when encountering individuals with intellectual disabilities. Williams shares his personal journey, detailing how being diagnosed with epilepsy and intellectual disability initially led to feelings of isolation and discouragement. However, joining the Special Olympics dramatically changed his life, offering him an inclusive environment where he found support, friendship, and the opportunity to excel in sports. The organization's founders, Dr. Frank Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, played a pivotal role in advocating for the benefits of sports for individuals with intellectual disabilities, leading to a significant shift in understanding and proving that such athletes can thrive in sports and contribute meaningfully to society. Williams' transformation represents the broader community of over 440,000 athletes globally who have benefited from the Special Olympics' initiatives.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "Matthew Williams, a successful athlete representingating Canada across various sports, credits the Special Olympics for transforming societal views on individuals with intellectual disabilities. Despite progress since its founding in 1968 by Dr. Frank Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Williams notes that people with intellectual disabilities are still often overlooked and subjected to derogatory language. His personal journey, marked by initial feelings of isolation due to his diagnoses of epilepsy and intellectual disability, was radically altered by joining the Special Olympics. This led him to an inclusive environment where he found support, friendship, and opportunities for athletic excellence. The Special Olympics has been instrumental in advocating for the benefits of sports for individuals with intellectual disabilities, shifting public understanding and demonstrating their can thrive and make meaningful contributions to society. Over 440,000 athletes globally have benefitted from the organization's initiatives. \n\nThe Special Olympics also significantly impact athletes' self-esteem and address health concerns. It addresses reduced life expectancy among individuals with intellectual disabilities by focusing on health and sports, including nutrition coaching and providing free health check-ups to those with communication challenges with healthcare providers. The organization's influence extends beyond sports, shaping athletes' lives positively. A case in point is a 2011 basketball match where Nigerian players received free hearing aids, leading to notable improvements in their demeanor and engagement. \n\nHowever, studies show that many Americans have limited interactions with individuals with intellectual disabilities, resulting in intolerance and negative attitudes, often expressed through derogatory language. Franklin Stevens and other athletes advocate for greater understanding and empathy, encouraging others to engage with the Special Olympics to potentially change perspectives.",
