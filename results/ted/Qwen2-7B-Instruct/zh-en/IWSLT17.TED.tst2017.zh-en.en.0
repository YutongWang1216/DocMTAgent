Alright, I'm going to tell a story about how we understand what we know.
This story is about this woman, Natalia Lychinskaya.
She is a paleontologist, specializing in excavating ancient things everywhere.
Natalia Lychinskaya: "Yes, some people call me 'Fried Thing' Doctor."
I find her particularly interesting because the places she digs are in high-latitude Arctic regions, far-off Canadian permafrost.
In the summer of 2006, she was at an archaeological excavation site called the Faleyejebad, which was is less than 10 degrees of latitude away from the geomagnetic North Pole.
NR: "To be honest, it doesn't sound all that interesting." "You have to carry a backpack all day, with a GPS navigator and notebook," "trekking long distances, picking up anything that might be a fossil."
However, at a certain moment, she noticed something.
"A little rusty thing, roughly the size of my palm," she says.
"It was just lying on the ground."
Her first thought was that it was nothing more than a piece of wood, because this was what people had found in Farsyejebad - prehistoric plant material.
"But that night, back at the camp...
"NR: '...'I took out my handheld microscope,' I observed more carefully and suddenly realized, 'This thing doesn't seem to have growth rings.'"
"ThereIt could be due to preservation issues," "but it really does look like..."
"Bones."
In the subsequent four years, she repeatedly returned to the location, eventually collecting 30 fragments, all from the same bone, with many being exceedingly small.
"Not that many, actually. A small zipper bag would suffice."
Then she tried to assemble the fragments like puzzle pieces.
But this was very challenging.
"It shattered into numerous tiny fragments," "We attempted to restore it using sand and mud, but it looked terrible."
Finally, we used a three-dimensional surface scanner.
"Oh wow! 'Very cool, right?'"
Finally, it turned out that restoring virtually was much simpler.
"When they were all put together, it really feels magical."
"How confident are you that you've assembled it correctly, to its original form?"
Could there be a possibility that by assembling it differently, you end up with... something like a small parrot?
"Well, no worries. We definitely put it together right."
She discovered that she had assembled a tibia, or shin bone, from an even-toed ungulate mammal, such as cattle or sheep.
But this could never have been a cow or a sheep.
It was was too large.
"The size of this thing is really immense. It's a big animal."
So what kind of animal could it be?
Facing a roadblock, she showed one of the fragments to some colleagues in Colorado, and then they came up with ideas.
"We used a little saw, scraping off a tiny bit from the edges of the fragments," she said, "and that's when some truly magical scents emerged."
It smelled a bit like burnt flesh.
It's a scent Natalia is familiar with, one she encountered in the gross anatomy lab when slicing through skull bones, that being collagen.
Collagen gives our bones their hardness.
In general, after so many years, it would naturally decompose.
However, the Arctic seems to act as a natural freezer, preserving this situation.
After one or two years, Natalia attended a conference in Bristol, where she saw one of her colleagues, named Mike Buckley, demonstrating a new technology, which he referred to as "collagen fingerprinting."
Indeed, the structure of collagen differs slightly between different species, so if you have collagen information from an unknown bone, you can compare it with known species' collagen information. So, who knows, maybe you've found found the matching information.
So, she sent him a piece via FedEx.
"Of course, you need to keep an eye on the delivery progress. It's crucial."
Then he processed the sample and compared it with 37 contemporary known mammalian species.
The result: a match!
The final conclusion is that the bone, which has a history of 3.5 million years, found by Natalia in the high-latitude Arctic region, is from...
A camel.
"I mean, what the heck? If we're right, this is amazing."
So they tested a pile of fragments, getting the same result for each one.
However, judging by the size of the bone they found, this means the camel is they discovered was 30% larger than modern camels.
So this camel would be roughly 2.5 meters tall and weigh a ton.
(AExclamatory) Yes!
Natalia discovered a "Great Camel of the Arctic".
Now when you hear the word "camel," your mind might picture these scenes: the dromedary camel in East and Central Asia.
But more likely, the image in your mind depicts something like this: the dromedary camel, a typical desert dweller, frequently found in hot desert regions like the Middle East or Sahara, with a giant hump on its back for storing water during long treks across the desert, and broad feet to help them traverse sand dunes.
So, how did these guys end up in the high-latitude Arctic?
Actually, scientists knew that, prior to Natalia's discovery, camels originated from America.
(Music: "The Star-Spangled Banner" - the national anthem of the United States) They originated here.
Over the 45 million years that camels have existed, they were only likely to be found in North America for 40 million years, with a total of 20 different species, possibly more.
"Would they look different if we lined them up?"
"Yes, their body sizes vary significantly."
"ThereSome have particularly long necks segments," "So they function similarly to giraffes."
Some also have long noses, like those of crocodiles.
"They are exceptionally primitive, with some of the earliest ones possibly quite small," "almost like a little rabbit."
What? A camel the size of a rabbit?
"The earliest ones were indeed quite small."
"Those might be unrecognizable to you."
Oh my goodness, I would love to have a "rabbit camel" as a pet!
"I know, it's going to be fantastic, right?"
Then, around 3 to 5 million years ago, a branch of the camel migrated south to South America, where they evolved into llamas or alpacas. Another branch crossed the Bering Land Bridge, arriving in Asia and Africa.
Towards the end of the last ice age, the camel in North America had gone extinct.
So, these were known to the scientists, but this does not fully explain how Natalia managed to find a camel so far north.
Here, in terms of temperature, it is the complete opposite of the Sahara.
To be honest, 3.5 million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius higher than it is now.
So it could be considered a northern forest, somewhat akin to today's Yukon region or Siberia.
However, they still have a six-month-long winter, with all ponds being frozen.
You would encounter snowstorms.
You would encounter 24 hours of continuous darkness.
"What... what exactly is going on?"
How could these Sahara Desert superstars survive under such harsh cold conditions?
Natalia and her colleagues felt they had found the solution.
And this answer is quite clever.
What if these characteristics of camels, which we don't believe are adaptations for environments like the Sahara, evolved instead as a response to endure harsh winters?
What if those broad hooves weren't meant for trudging through sand dunes, but rather like snow boots, for traversing snowy terrains?
What if those humps—this is monumental!—are storing not water but fat, making the humps actually designed for camels to survive through food-scarce, six-month-long winter frosts?
What if, far beyond that point, after crossing continental bridges, they transformed these winter traits to suit arid desert environments?
For instance, those humps could be advantageous for camels in hot regions, as when your fat accumulates in one spot, you know, akin to a "fat backpack", implying that your body's insulating layer doesn't need to cover your entire body.
This made cooling more straightforward.
It was this mad notion that transforms the seemingly typical desert attributes of camels into evidence of their origin in the high-latitude Arctic.
In fact, I am not the first person to tell this story.
Others have spoken on this subject, marveling at the wonders of biological evolution or casting a glance at future climate changes.
But I love this story for another reason.
For me, it's a story about us, about how we perceive the world, and about how that perception changes.
My profession is a historian.
I've realized that many scientists are actually historians.
They sort out the past.
They tell the history of the universe, Earth, and life on Earth.
As a historian, you need to have a train of thought, pondering how the story might unfold.
"We're crafting stories, and then we follow the narrative, right? Like the camels in the desert, you see?"
"This is a fantastic story! Camels are just so perfectly for the desert."
"It's clear that the camels have always been living there."
At any moment, you might stumble upon a small clue.
You might uncover little things that force you to reframe what you thought you knew.
Just like in this case, where a scientist mistook this fragment for wood, it was her discovery that led to the emergence of a new, counterintuitive theory in science. This theory explains why this peculiar, hair-monster-like creature evolved into its current form.
For me, this completely overturned my view on camels.
It transformed from a creature that thrived in a specific environment to a globe-trotteror, coincidentally appearing in the Sahara and potentially anywhere at any time.
This is Azul.
Hello, Azul! How are you?
Come, I brought you something to eat.
Azul has just completed her guest performance, coming from Radio City Music Hall in New York.
This isn't no laughing matter.
Alright then... Frankly, Azul's presence here serves as a vivid example, illustrating how the story of this world can change so rapidly.
We need proactivity, to boldly make changes and reimagine possibilities.
Azul, do you think it's true?
Frankly, all it takes is a tiny fragment of bone for us to adopt a fresh perspective on the world.
Thank you all.
