However, when tackling a 90-page graduation thesis, the author encountered difficulties applying this method, recognizing the thesis's significance as a substantial undertaking. A new plan was devised: initiating with minor tasks, gradually increasing commitment over several months, and then intensifying productivity nearing the deadline. Initially, progress was slow, leading the author to develop an innovative revision strategy. Despite the initial struggle, the author later managed to write 90 pages in just 7 hours, sacrificing sleep, although the work was of poor quality. This experience prompted the author to become a blogger, focusing on procrastination due to personal struggles with the habit. The author sought to explore the neurological basis of procrastination by comparing their own brain, indicative of procrastination tendencies, with a non-procrastinator's's brain using MRI scans, aiming to understand the differences between procrastinators' and non-procrastinators' brains.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, facing challenges in managing time and productivity during the extensive process of writing a 90-page graduation thesis, developed a novel approach to overcome procrastination. Initially, progress was slow, leading to the creation of an innovative revision strategy. Despite the intense effort, which resulted in sleep deprivation and subpar work quality, the author was able to complete the thesis in 7 hours. This experience inspired the author to become a blogger, focusing on overcoming procrastination. The author explores the neurological underpinnings of procrastination by contrasting their own brain, characterized by procrastination tendencies, with that of a non-procrastinator observed through MRI scans. The comparison highlights the existence of an 'instant gratification' entity within the procrastinator's's brain, analogous to an 'animalistic' inclination towards immediate pleasure over long-term goals, suggesting a neurological basis for procrastination behaviors.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "Facing difficulties in managing time and productivity while working on a 90-page graduation thesis, the author devised a unique method to combat procrastination, resulting in an intense 7 7-hour completion. This experience sparked their interest in blogging about overcoming procrastination, delving into the neurological aspects. By comparing their own brain, marked by procrastination, with a non-procrastinator's brain observed through MRI scans, they discovered a 'instant gratification' component in procrastinators akin to an animalistic drive for immediate pleasure over long-term goals. This neurological insight was seen as foundational to procrastination behaviors. The author also highlights the internal conflict within humans between the 'monkey' side, embodying primal desires for simple pleasures, and the 'rational decision-maker', symbolizing foresight and long-term planning. This conflict often leads procrastinators to engage in 'dark playground' activities, prioritizing fleeting pleasures over significant goals. Understanding and managing this inner struggle can aid in prioritizing meaningful tasks over temporary, trivial satisfactions.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "Facing challenges in managing time and productivity due to procrastination while working on a 90-page graduation thesis, the author developed a unique approach to overcome this issue, successfully completing the work in just 7 hours. This experience inspired the author to delve into the neurological aspects of procrastination, exploring the 'instant gratification' component found in the brains of procrastinators, likened to an animalistic drive for immediate pleasure over long-term goals. The author compares their own brain with one observed through MRI scans in non-procrastinators, identifying a foundational link between this 'instant gratification' trait and procrastination behaviors. They also highlight the internal conflict within humans between the 'monkey' side, representing of primal desires for simple pleasures, and the 'rational decision-maker,' symbolizing foresight and long-term planning. This conflict often leads procrastinators to prioritize 'dark playground' activities, focusing on temporary pleasures over significant goals. Understanding and managing this inner struggle can aid in prioritizing meaningful tasks over trivial satisfactions. Additionally, the paragraph discusses how procrastination often arises from feelings of guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-hatred, introducing the concept of the \"Panic Beast,\" an internal force that emerges during critical times, such as approaching deadlines, to motivate action by instilling fear. The author shares their personal experience with the Panic Beast, explaining how it became significant after being invited to give a TED talk, leading to the rational decision-maker taking control and enabling the individual to start preparing for the speech.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "Facing challenges in managing time and productivity due to procrastination while working on a 90-page graduation thesis, the author developed a unique approach to overcome this issue, successfully completing the work in just 7 hours. This experience inspired the author to delve into the neurological aspects of procrastination, exploring the 'instant gratification' component found in the brains of procrastinators, likened to an animalistic drive for immediate pleasure over long-term goals. The author compares their own brain with one observed through MRI scans in non-procrastinators, identifying a foundational link between this 'instant gratification' trait and procrastination behaviors. They also highlight the internal conflict within humans between the 'monkey' side, represent of primal desires for simple pleasures, and the 'rational decision-maker,' symbolizing foresight and long-term planning. This conflict often leads procrastinators to prioritize 'dark playground' activity, focusing temporary pleasures over significant goals. Understanding and managing this inner struggle can aid in prioritizing meaningful tasks over trivial satisfactions. The paragraph also discusses how procrastination often arises from feelings of guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-hatred, introducing the concept of the \"Panic Beast,\" an internal force that emerges during critical times, such as approaching deadlines, to motivate action by instilling fear. The author shares their personal experience with the Panic Beast, explaining how it became significant after being invited to give a TED talk, leading to the rational decision-maker taking control and enabling the individual to start preparing for the speech. The author further notes that this behavior is not unique and receives widespread acknowledgment from people across different professions and life stages, emphasizing the contrast between the casual tone of sharing experiences with procrastination and the serious impact it has on individuals' lives. Two main types of procrastination are identified: one related to tasks with explicit deadlines, where the Panic Beast intervenes, leading to bursts of activity before the deadline, and another type occurring in the absence of deadlines, referred to as \"deadline-less\" procrastination. In the latter case, the lack of a deadline prevents the Panic Beast from manifesting, potentially leading to continuous postponement of important tasks without any clear endpoint. The author suggests that addressing the psychological and behavioral mechanisms behind procrastination, especially in the absence of deadlines, could help individuals better manage their time and achieve their goals more effectively.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "Facing challenges with time management and productivity due to procrastination while working on a 90-page graduation thesis, the author developed a unique approach to overcome this issue, successfully completing the work in just 7 hours. This experience inspired the author to explore the neurological aspects of procrastination, specifically the 'instant gratification' component found in the brains of procrastinators, comparing their own brain with one observed through MRI scans in non-procrastinators. The author identifies a foundational link between this 'instant gratification' trait and procrastination behaviors, highlighting the internal conflict within humans between the 'monkey' side, representing for primal desires for simple pleasures, and the 'rational decision-maker,' symbolizing foresight and long-term planning. Understanding and managing this inner struggle can aid in prioritizing meaningful tasks over trivial satisfactions. The author also discusses how procrastination often arises from feelings of guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-hatred, introducing the concept of the \"Panic Beast,\" an internal force that emerges during critical times to motivate action by instilling fear. The author shares their personal experience with the Panic Beast, explaining how it became significant after being invited to give a TED talk, leading to the rational decision-maker taking control and enabling the individual to start preparing for the speech. The author further notes that this behavior is not unique and receives widespread acknowledgment from people across different professions and life stages, emphasizing the contrast between the casual tone of sharing experiences with procrastination and the serious impact it has on individuals' lives. The paragraph also discusses how procrastination often arises from feelings of guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-hatred, introducing the concept of the \"Panic Beast,\" an internal force that emerges during critical times to motivate action by instilling fear. The author shares their personal experience with the Panic Beast, explaining how it became significant after being invited to give a TED talk, leading to the rational decision-maker taking control and enabling the individual to start preparing for the speech. The author also suggests usinging a 'Life Calendar', a visual tool representinging the remaining weeks of a hypothetical 99-year lifespan, to help individuals reflect on their procrastinations and the urgency to address them.",
