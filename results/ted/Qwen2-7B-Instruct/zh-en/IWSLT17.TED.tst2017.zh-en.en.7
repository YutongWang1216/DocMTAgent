As a child, I waspired about the ocean.
There, colorful and vibrant, lived many animals that resembled extraterrestrial creatures.
I imagined the apex predator sharks at the top of the food chain, and fantasized about turtles gracefully dancing among the coral reefs.
As a photographer who transitioned from marine biologist, most of my career has been spent searching for places that appeared in my childhood fantasies.
As everyone can see, I've been adventuringing underwater since I was young.
But it wasn't when I was ten years old that I truly dived underwater for the first time.
I can still vividly recall the moment when I paddled hard to reach a rusted cannon lying on the coral reef.
In the end, I successfully reached the cannon, looking up to find myself surrounded by schools of fish, all in various colors like a rainbow.
From that day on, I fell deeply in love with the ocean.
(Captions: Thomas Peschak) ( (Captions: Eco-photographer) Over the past 40 years, I have had the privilege of exploring some of the world's's most spectacular underwater landscapes, contributing to National Geographic and the "Save Our Seas" Foundation.
My subjects ranged from giant sharks to ones small enough to swim in the palm of your hand.
In the cold waters bordering the Great Bear Rainforest in Canada, I've encountered humpback whales feasting right next to me, their fishy breath indelible in memory.
In the Mozambique Channel, I witnessed the courtship rituals of green turtles.
Each of us impacts the ocean, and the ocean impacts us.
And the pristine ocean that I dreamed of as a child is now increasingly hard to find.
Their range is shrinking, and they are under increasing threat.
We humans have always occupied the top of the food chain on this planet, and I've seen and documented these behaviors with my camera.
For a long time, I thought that only striking photographs could awaken my audience.
Of course, this perspective has its benefits, which is bringing me back to square one.
I believe the best way to bring about change is through spreading love.
I feel like a bridge between humans and animals, as a photographer, I have the rare opportunity to uncover the mysteries of the animal kingdom and ecosystems hidden deep within the oceans.
If you don't even know something exists, how could you possibly love and protect it?
And this is where we, the eco-photographers, excel.
I've visited hundreds of different seas, but there are only a few scenes that have truly left a lasting impression on me.
The first time I was awestruck by such a scene was was almost a decade ago, on the rugged and steep coastline of South Africa.
Every June and July, countless sardines migrate north, which we refer to as the "Sardine Run".
Believe me, these fish have to do this.
Because there were packs of hungry predators, quick on their feet, chasing after them.
For example, groups of dolphins hunting together, they separate part of the sardine school, gathering them into spherical formations.
Dolphins will herd the sardines school closer to the surface, then charge into the crowd to feast, enjoying this moving banquet.
Following closely are the sharks.
Most people would consider sharks and dolphins as natural enemies, but in the "Sardine Run", they coexist.
Actually, with the help of dolphins, sharks enjoy their more.
Without dolphins driving them, sardines balls would be hard to form. Sharks often slice through the schools like doughnuts, leaving them with just water in their stomachss.
During my encounters with the shark congregation in the "Sardine Run", I realized that the sharks did not consider me as a threat.
But I was still constantly bumped into and swept by tails, just like the other guests at this loud feast.
We sailed eastward from the African coastline across the vast Indian Ocean, arriving in the Maldives, a chain of islands composed of coral reefs.
During the constant stormy southwest monsoon season, manta rays living in the lagoon waters of the archipelago gather around a small island called Hanifaru.
Schools of tiny shrimp and crabs, most smaller than our pupils, form the primary diet of mantas.
When the plankton is more dispersed, mantas typically feed alone, rolling backward in the water like dogs chasing their own tails.
When the plankton becomes more concentrated, mantas start swimming in a head-to-t-head formation, creating a long feeding line. The delicious food missed by the leading manta is consumed by the following companions.
As the plankton in the bay accumulates, the mantas gather into tighter formations, a unique feeding method we refer to as "whirlpool feeding."
The mantas stack upon each other, forming a tight spiral vortex that sucks in the plankton, directly guiding it into the giant mouths of the mantas.
Diving amongst thousands of manta rays, an image that will stay with me forever.
When I first went to Hanifaru to take photos, it was had not yet been protected, and its ecosystem was under threat from local development.
Through collaborations with organizations like the Manta Trust, my photographs ultimately contributed to Hanifaru becoming an ocean sanctuary.
Fishermen on nearby islands, who had once hunted many manta rays for their skins to make traditional drums.
And now, they have become the most steadfast protectors of the manta rays, which annually bring over $8 million to the Maldives.
I've always wanted to go back to a time when most of the map was was still blank, or marked with "There be dragons."
So far, the closest places I've visited are some remote atolls located in the West Indian Ocean.
There, away from fishing grounds and boats, diving always leaves me feeling melancholic, reminding me of what the ocean used to be.
Few have heard of the Indo Bank, a small coral atoll situated in the Mozambique Channel.
The outer reefs form a protective barrier, with the lagoon in the middle serving as a nursery for Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are never shy, just as much in daylight as they are at night.
I reckon they'd be more lively and in greater numbers at night.
I had never seen如此 many sharks in a coral lagoon before.
Capturinging and sharing these moments - a constant reminder of why I chose this path.
This year, to fulfill my contract shoot for National Geographic, I came to the California Peninsula.
In the center of the peninsula, along the Pacific Ocean side, lies San Ignacio Lagoon, an important breeding ground for gray whales.
In the past century, this coastline served as a massive slaughterhouse, with over 20,000 gray whales being killed here, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
And now, these descendants of the gray whales will their calves to the surface, playfully interact with us, and even engage in playful behavior together.
This species has surprisingly recovered.
On the other side of the peninsula is Porme Cape, a tranquil fishing village.
Decades of overfishing had once pushed this village to the brink of bankruptcy.
In 1995, local fishermen convinced the government to designate this area as an ocean sanctuary.
What follows can truly be called a miracle.
In 2005, just after 10 years of protection, scientists found that the number of local fish had achieved a record-record recovery.
See what you see, come along with me.
Hold your breath and dive with me into the depths, to witness the scale and density of the largest fish aggregations I've ever encountered.
We all have the power to create hope.
I want to convey through my photos that it's not too late to start saving the oceans from now on.
I particularly wish to focus on nature's capacity for recovery, when it faces 7 billion humans.
I hope in the future, it will be increasingly difficult for me to capture images like these, and instead, I will be able to document more photographs reflecting harmony between humans and the ocean.
I really wish I could take such photos every day.
To make a name for yourself in this field, you must be an incurable optimist.
I always approach my photography with the assumption that the next great image that can bring about change is awaits me just ahead, perhaps lurking behind the next coral reef, within the next lagoon, or perhaps, just beyond.
