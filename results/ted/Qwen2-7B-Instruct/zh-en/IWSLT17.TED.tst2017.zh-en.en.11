You may never have heard of Kambia in Sierra Leone or Arewa in Nigeria.
But I think they are the two best places on Earth.
In those hospitals, there is a community of nurses, surgeons, and scientists who, for years, have been quietly battling one of humanity's most lethal threats - the Marburg virus.
The Lassa virus is very similar to the Ebola virus.
It can cause severe fever symptoms, and often be fatal.
However, these people risk their lives every day to protect every member of the community, while also safeguarding us all.
The best lesson I learned from them was, when I first visited many years ago, they would start each day during those challenging, front-line days by singing.
They gather together,尽情 enjoying themselves.
They embody a spirit.
Over many years, as we continue to visit each other year after year, I can gather with them to sing, and we document these moments, and we love doing this because it reminds us that we are not just on a quest for scientific truth, but there is also a human bond that ties us closely together.
And you can imagine how crucial this connection becomes when things around us change, even becoming indispensable.
In March 2014, a巨变 occurred. The Ebola outbreak erupted in Guinea.
This was the first outbreak in the region of West Africa, occurring at the border between Sierra Leone and Liberia.
The situation was terrifying, leaving all of us stunned.
In fact, we even wondered if the spread of the Marburg virus and the Ebola outbreak were more widespread than we thought, and we were concerned that it might one day reach Kambia.
Thus, my team members set out immediately, joining Dr. Humal Khan and his team there, where we established diagnostic equipment to conduct sensitive molecular tests. When the Ebola virus crossed the border of Sierra Leone, we would be able to detect it.
We had already set up equipment on this scale for the Lassa virus, knowing how to handle it, and this team was was exceptional.
We just need to provide them with the equipment and space to study Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day arriveded.
On May 23, 2014, a woman entered the hospital's delivery room, and our team conducted those crucial molecular tests, confirming Sierra Leone's first case of Ebola.
This is actually quite remarkable.
They can diagnose cases promptly, safely treat patients, and begin tracing contacts while monitoring the spread of the disease.
It could have prevented something.
However, when that day arriveded, the outbreak had been brewing for months.
After discovering hundreds of cases, it made all previous outbreaks pale in comparison.
And the virus didn't enter Sierra Leone through that single case; it was a massive shockwave.
We need to work closely with the international community, collaborating with health departments and the local community in Kambia, to tackle these cases together. Over the next week, 31 patients arrived, followed by 92, and then it rose to 147 - all heading to Kambia because was one of the few places in Sierra Leone capable of handling the outbreak.
We worked day and night, giving it our all, hoping to help every patient, seeking attention, but all while doing something else simple.
To detect the Ebola virus, we extracted samples from the patient's blood, which we could simply discard.
But what we can do additionally is to treat the samples with chemicals to deactivate them, then seal them in boxes, and ship them across the ocean. And that is precisely what we did.
We sent the samples to Boston, where my team works,
We too worked around the clock, rotating shifts, and thus quickly compiled 99 Ebola virus genomes.
This is the blueprint - the viral genome is is the blueprint.
This is also present within us humans.
It details everything that makes up our bodies, imparting us with a wealth of information.
The results of this work are simple, yet powerful.
We can take these 99 different viral variants, observe and compare them, and we can clearly see that the disease began spreading in Guinea months prior to the three genomic sequences released by the Guinean side. Once it entered the population, it rapidly transmitted through person-to-person contact.
This information is crucial, especially when you're trying to figure out how to stop the spread of the virus. But the most important thing is contact tracing.
We can also see that as the virus spreads from person to person, it continues to mutate.
Every mutation is paramount because all diagnostics, vaccines, and the treatments we employ are fundamentally based on that specific genomic sequence - the very root cause of the outbreak.
Thus, global health experts need to respond quickly, improve research methods, and adjust everything they do.
However, from where I was at the time, scientific research meant obtaining the data, potentially spending months locked in a lab analyzing it meticulously, writing papers, revise them repeatedly, and then finally have the data published so it could be shared with the public.
This was what the state of scientific research was like back then.
Well, that method surely wouldn't have worked at that specific time, right?
We have friends working on the front lines against the disease, and obviously, the most crucial thing for us is external assistance, a great deal of assistance.
So the first thing we did was, as soon as the sequencing results came off the machine, we immediately put them up online.
We put the information out there for the world to see, and then say: "Help us!"
Thus, assistance poured in.
We hadn't even processed it, when all of a sudden, people from around the world reached out to us, amazed to find our data openly available online.
And suddenly, some of the world's best virus hunters were part of our team!
We collaborate in this virtual manner, sharing information and frequently calling each other, maintaining constant contact, aiming to track the virus's spread second by second, and then finding ways to contain it.
Actually, there are various ways for us to form such a group.
Everyone, especially during outbreaks on a global scale, is constantly acquiring information and engaging in the effort.
Everyone wants to make a contribution.
The power of everyone around the world is truly miraculous, and the Internet connects us all.
Can you imagine it? We're no longer afraid to communicate with others, and we all say, "Let's get to work."
"Let's unite and we can definitely achieve this!"
The issue is that, the data we all rely on, the data we find online, simply cannot meet our needs for the job.
When this happens, we lose many opportunities.
So at the beginning of the outbreak in Kambia, we had 106 patient clinical records, and once again, we published these publicly.
In our own lab, with those 106 records you gave us, we could have let the computer predict the next Ebola patients, with accuracy close to 100%.
We also developed an app to disseminate these predictions to health professionals worldwide so they can access this information.
However, the 106 reports are insufficient, failing to make the method effective effective.
So we're holding off on releasing the software until we have more clinical reports.
And these reports have not arrived.
We're still waiting, still tweaking the software, stuck in the lab rather than collaborating with everyone.
This really... We cannot accept this.
Right? You, all of you, cannot accept that.
It's life or death right now.
However, many people sacrificed their lives, including colleagues in the medical field such as those I hold in great esteem - five colleagues: Marburg von Nie, Alex Muti, Dr. Humal Khan, Alice Kwoma, and Mohammed Fula.
These are just five among countless healthcare workers sacrifices in Kambia and elsewhere, while the world waits, and we work tirelessly, isolated and uncommunicative.
The Ebola virus, like all manner of threats to humanity, will worsen due to mistrust, division, and separation between individuals and individuals.
When we erect barriers against each other and fight amongst ourselves, the virus' power grows even stronger.
However, unlike other threats, this time we became one family.
We are all on the same side.
One person gets Ebola, and it might be us next.
Thus, we live in this world, sharing common vulnerabilities, strengths, fears, and aspirations, and I truly hope that we can work together with joy.
One of my graduated students, reading a book about Sierra Leone, came across the word "Kambia," the city and hospital where we worked in Sierra Leone, whose local Mendicant name means "as clear and pure as a river, accessible to all eyes."
This holds a profound significance for us, something we may not fully realize, but we've always felt that to honor everyone in Kambia, the place we've fought for, we must open up to collaboration, we must share information, and we must work together.
We must do this.
Everyone should hold themselves and others to this standard - when disaster strikes, we should all open our hearts to each other, fighting this battle together.
This isn't not the first nor the last time Ebola will strike, there are many other pathogens lurking around us, just like the Lassa virus and others.
The next time disaster strikes, it might be in a city of millions, and it could happen there.
The virus may spread through the air.
The virus might even be intentionally disseminated by people.
I know it's frightening, I understand, but I also know that this experience tells us that we have the technology and capability to win this battle, not just this battle, but to outsmart every virus.
But only when we work together in harmony can we achieve this, and with joy.
So for Dr. Khan, and all who have given their lives in the fight against disease, let we always stand alongside them in battle.
Our world should not be defined by the destruction caused by a single virus; instead, let us shine the light of billions of hearts united in cooperation across the globe.
Thank you everyone.
