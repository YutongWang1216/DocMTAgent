Alright, let's see how many people here have blocked friends on Facebook because they said something inappropriate about politics, religion, children rights, or food, etc.?
How many of you have at least one person you don't want to see, because you just don't want to talk to them?
To know, in the past, wanting a polite conversation, we just had to follow Henry Higgins' advice in "My Fair Lady" and stick to talking about the weather and your health.
But in recent years, with climate change and the rise of anti-vaccination movements - this approach has become less effective.
Therefore, in the world we live in, where every conversation could potentially escalate into an argument, politicians cannot communicate with each other, and there are passionate crowds for or against even trivial matters. This is simply unacceptable.
According to a survey by the Pew Research Center among ten thousand American adults, it was found that our current level of extremism, our firm stance, is higher than at any other time in history.
We are less inclined to compromise, which means we are not listening to each other.
All the decisions we make, where we choose to live, whom we marry, even whom we choose to befriend, are all based solely on the beliefs we already hold.
To reiterate, this indicates that we are not listening to each other.
Conversation requires a balance between telling and listening, yet somehow we have lost this balance.
Technological advancements are part of the reason.
For example, smartphones, which are now in your hands or just beside you, easily accessible.
According to Pew's research, about one-third of American teenagers send over one hundred text messages per day.
And among these many, almost all, prefer texting friends rather than having face-to face conversations.
The Atlantic magazine published a fantastic article,
The author is high school teacher Paul Barnwell.
He assigned his students a task of communication,
Hope to teach them how to give a speech on a particularic topic without relying on notes.
Then he said, "I began to realize..."
"I began to realize that communication skills might be the most neglected and under-tstructed abilities we possess."
Children spend hours each day engaging with creativity and other peers through screens, but rarely have opportunities to develop their interpersonal skills."
It sounds humorous, yet we must ask ourselves: in the 21st century, what skill could be more crucial than sustaining a coherent, confident conversation?
Now, my job is to talk to people. Nobel laureates, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, governors, plumbers.
I converse with people I like, and also those I don't.
I converse with people who I personally strongly disagree with on a personal level.
But I still have good conversations with them.
So I hope to spend the next 10 minutes teaching you how to talk, and how to listen.
Many of you have heard countless suggestions before, such as making eye contact, preparing interesting topics to discuss ahead of time, maintaining gaze, nodding, and smiling to show your attention, repeating what you just heard, or summarizing.
I want you to forget all that.
It's all useless.
There's no need to learn how to appear attentive if you're actually being attentive.
I actually apply the same techniques I use as a professional interviewer to my everyday life.
Alright, I'm going to teach you how to conduct interviews, which will actually help you become better communicators.
Learning to initiate a conversation effectively, wasting no time, not finding it dull, and most importantly, avoiding offending anyone.
We've all had great conversations.
We've all experienced it. We know what it feels like.
That kind of conversation that leaves you feeling gratified and inspired, or one that makes you feel you've established a genuine connection with someone, or one that allows you to be completely understood by another person.
There's no reason why most of your social interactions can't be that way.
I have ten basic rules. I'll go through them one by one, but to be honest, if you pick one and master it, you're already set for more enjoyable conversations.
First rule: Don't be wishy-washy.
I'm not suggesting simply setting down your phone, tablet, car keys, or whatever you might be holding in your hand.
What I mean is, being present.
Immerse yourself in that context.
Don't think about your previous argument with your boss.
Don't think about what you'll eat for dinner.
If you want to leave the conversation, leave it. But don't be half-hearted about it.
Second rule: Don't be a know-it-all.
If you want to express your opinions without leaving any openings for responses, arguments, rebuttal, or elaboration, then blogging is the way to go.
There's a good reason to explain why there's no "expert preaching" in my conversations - it's just really boring.
If the other person is a conservative, they would definitely despise Obama, food stamps, and abortion.
If the other person is a liberal, they would certainly despise big banks, oil companies, and Dick Cheney.
Predictably.
You surely wouldn't want that.
You need to approach every conversation assuming you can learn something.
F. Scott Peck famously said, true listening requires putting yourself aside.
Sometimes, this means putting your personal opinions aside.
He says that when people feel accepted, the speaker becomes less vulnerable and sensitive, thus more likely to open up and reveal their inner world to the listener.
To reiterate, assume that you need to learn something new.
Bill Nye said: "Every person you will meet has something you don't know."
I'll reiterate: Everyone is an expert in some area.
Thirdly, use open-ended questions.
Regarding this, please refer to the questioning approach used in professional interviews.
Begin asking "who," "what," "when," "where," "why," or "how" questions.
If you ask a complex question, you will receive a simple answer.
If I were to ask you, "Were you afraid at the time?"
You would respond to that phrase with the most powerful word in it, which is "fear", and the answer would be "yes" or "no".
"If you asked, 'Were you angry at the time?'" "Yes, I was was very angry."
Let the other person describe; they are the one who understands the situation.
Try asking them this question: "What was it like?"
"How did you feel?"
As a result, the other person might have to pause and think, leading to a more interesting response.
Fourth point: Let things unfold naturally.
In other words, ideas would naturally flow into your mind, and you would need to express them.
In interviews, we often hear guests speaking for a few minutes, then the host comes back with a question that seems to come out of nowhere or has already been answered.
This suggests that the interviewer might not have been paying attention for the past two minutes, as they had thought of this clever question and was now fixated on askinging it.
We too would do the same.
When we sit down to converse with someone, we suddenly recall that encounter with Hugh Jackman at a coffee shop.
Then we stopped listening.
Stories and ideas always flow in on you,
But even if you cannot stop them, do not let them linger too much in your mind.
F. If you don't know, just say you don't know.
People on radio shows, especially those on National Public Radio ( NPR, are well aware that their are being broadcasted, so they are more cautious about what they claim to be experts on and what they assert with certainty.
Learn to do so. Speak and act with caution.
The conversation should be a responsible act.
Sixthly, do not compare your experiences with others'.
Do not start talking about losing family members if the other person is discussing it.
If the other person is discussing work troubles, don't tell them how much you dislike your job.
This is different, and it can never be the same.
Every experience is unique.
And, more importantly, this isn't not about you.
You don't need to prove your competence or the hardships you've endured at this moment.
Someone once asked Stephen Hawking what his IQ was was, to which he replied, "I don't know. Those who brag about their IQ are geeks."
Conversation is not for self-promotion.
The Seventh Rule: Try not to repeat yourself.
It's aggressive and boring, but we can easily do it.
Especially in work-related conversations or when talking to children, we want to express an opinion, so we keep restatingting it in different ways.
Don't do that.
The Eighth Rule: Say Less Garbage.
Essentially, no one cares about those years, names, dates, and all the details you struggle to recall in your mind.
Others don't care; they're focused on you.
The other party cares about who you are and what common points you have.
So forget about the details. Don't worry about them.
The ninth point: This is not the last one, but it is the most important one.
Listen attentively.
I'm not sure how many influential people have said that listening might be the most important, the topmost skill you can improve.
Buddha said - paraphrased, "If your mouth is not stopping, you cannot learn anything."
Calvin Coolidge once said, "No one has ever been fired for listening too much."
Why are we unwilling to listen to each other?
Firstly, we prefer to speak.
When I'm speaking, everything is under my control.
I don't have to listen to anything that doesn't interest me.
I am the center of attention.
I can reinforce my sense of identity.
However, there is is another reason: we are being interrupted.
The average person speaks about 225 words per minute, but we can hear nearly 501 words per minute.
So our minds are occupied by those additional 275 words.
I know it takes a lot of effort to truly pay attention to what someone else is saying. But if you don't do that, you're not really having a conversation.
You are just two people shouting at each other in the same place, saying things that have nothing to do with each other.
You must listen to each other.
Stephen Covey has a wonderful exposition on this.
He said: "Most of us aren't listening to understand."
"We listen to respond."
The final point, the tenth: Be concise.
"Good conversation is like a well-t-fitted mini-skirt; short enough to attract, yet long enough to encompass the subject - my sister's's metaphor. All of this boils down to one concept: showing interest in others."
I grew up with a famous grandfather, and our home was always bustling with guests.
Guestss would come and speak with my grandparents, and after they left, my mother would come over to us and say, "Do you know who that was?"
She was the second runner-up of Miss America.
He is the mayor of Sacramento.
She won the Pulitzer Prize. He is a Russian ballerina.
I grew up assuming that everyone had hidden brilliance.
To be honest, I think it's all of this that has made me a better host.
I try to speak less, but open my mind, always ready for surprise, and I never feel disappointed.
"You can do the same."
Step outside, talk to others, listen to them, and most importantly, be prepared to be surprised.
Thank you.
