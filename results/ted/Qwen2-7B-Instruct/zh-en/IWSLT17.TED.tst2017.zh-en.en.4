We were there. Souls and bodies squeezed into a Texas church, which was was our last night on earth.
Like this room we're in now, only there the benches creak, hung with tattered red ribbons, the organ's on my left, the choir behind me, and a baptismal pool built into the back wall.
In essence, like this room.
The same sense of suspense, the same profound longing for redemption, the same bitter sweat in the palm, and at the back, still a group of people absent-minded.
That was December 31st, 1999, the night when, as far as I know, Christ returned to Earth, and the world was nearing its end.
At that time, I was 12 years old, reaching the age to be held responsible.
I realized it was unjust for Jesus to return at this moment, as I was about to take responsibility for all my actions. But when I stopped complaining, I thought it best for me to tidy up my house as soon as possible.
I went to church as much as possible.
I feared the stillness around me, just as one fears noise, to repeatedly assure myself that God had not tricked me, returning early but leaving me behind.
However, in case he really came early, I have a backup plan, which I read from the popular book "Left Behind".
In my reading, if I was not taken away after the midnight revelry, I would have one more chance.
I just need not be labeled a heretic, defeat the devil, overcome the plague, and also topple the anti-Christ.
This would be quite difficult - but I believe I can manage it.
However, the time for preparation has long passed.
It is already 11:50 PM.
We have ten minutes left. The priest asked us to rise from our benches and walk down to the altar, because he wanted us to pray together at the moment when midnight struck.
Thus, the congregation was divided into several groups and moved to their designated positions.
The choir remained on the small stage, while the church deacons and their wives - I prefer to call them "Baptist Bourgeoisie" - took their seats in the first row in front of the altar.
You see, even in America, there are VIP seats on the night of Christ's's return.
Behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie were the older generation - these men and women whose youthful backs, bent by the scorching sun in the cotton fields of East Texas, now bear deep furrowsed faces, tboned brown like the clay of East Texas, their dreams and fantasies about life and the world beyond East Texas, sometimes more broken than their backs.
Yes - these men and women, they my idols, my stars.
They waited their entire lives for this moment, just as their medieval forebears longed for the apocalypse, just as my grandmother eagerly anticipated Oprah, airing every day at four on Channel Eight.
As she made her way to the altar, I slipped behind her, for I was absolutely certain that my grandmother was destined for heaven.
I thought, perhaps if I held her hand tightly during this prayer, I might go with her.
So I gripped, closed my eyes, listened, and waited.
The prayers grew louder.
Responding to the prayers, the shouts grew even louder.
The organ sounded, intertwining with the elegy's voices.
The heat wave swept through, making the sweat on my palms more pungent.
My hand tightened further, I didn't want to be forsaken by God.
My eyes closed tighter, I didn't want to see the essence being taken away, while the dross was left behind.
Suddenly, a voice echoed overhead: "Amen."
The end.
I glance at the clock.
It has passed midnight.
I observed the older believers, their savior had not arrived, they were too proud to show even a hint of disappointment, they had believed so deeply and for so long that doubt was now too late.
But I'm angry for them.
They were deceived, tricked, and misled, yet I followed them in being deceived.
I performed the same prayers as they did, striving to resist the temptations within my heart.
I didn't just once, but twice, plunge myself into that sickening baptismal pool.
I had believed at one point.
What should we do now?
I went home and turned on the TV just in time to see Peter Jennings declare the arrival of the new millennium, with celebrations taking place around the world.
I suddenly realized, how strange it seemed no matter how I thought about it, that Jesus was to come back to Earth repeatedly, simply because of the different time zones across various locations.
This made me feel even worse, really hurt, you know.
But that night, I didn't stop believing.
I just believed in another thing: that it is possible not to believe.
It's entirely possible that all the answers I think I have are wrong, and that the question itself might be flawed.
Now, the mountain where once stood the peak of faith, a stream of questioning spring flows down to its foot, a refreshing torrent destined to become mighty rivers and oceans.
All the dramatic narratives of my life can be traced back to that night in the church when my savior did not come; the things I was hold to be true, if not lies, at least are not truths.
While many of you approached the millennium in vastly different ways, I believe you're here because some of you have done what I did, after the dawn of the new century, after my mother passed away, after my father left home, after my savior didn not come.
I stretched out my hands, frantically searching for a shred of something to believe in.
When I arrived at Yale at the age of eighteen, I sought to escape, believing that I had a chance to leave behind all the hardships and struggles I had endured, the shattered dreams, and the disabled body, as I journeyed from the small town in Texas.
But when I returned home during winter break, with my head pressed to the ground and my hands tightly bound behind me, with a robber's gun pressed against my forehead, I realized that even the best education couldn't save me.
When I interned at Lehman Brothers in 2008, I also searched for opportunities.
Full of hope - I excitedly called my family, telling them we would never be poor again.
But when I witnessed the financial temple crumble before my eyes into ruins, I knew that even the best job couldn't save me.
When I moved to Washington D.C. as a young journalist, I was searching, and I hear a voice from Illinois ( (referring to Obama's campaign speech) "It's been too long," "But in this election, America will embrace change."
But when parliamentary work came to a complete stand, and the country was on the brink of collapse, what was once hoped for and promised as change had turned into cruel punchlines. It was then that I realized that even political rebirth could not save me.
I bowed humbly at the altar of the American Dream, praying to the great figures of the age for success, wealth, and power.
But every time, as the clock strikes midnight, I open my eyes to see all these myths have died.
From this tomb, I began to search anew, not because I was brave, but because I knew that without faith, I would perish.
Therefore, I returned to another holy site, Harvard Business School - this time, I knew I couldn't simply accept the redemption offered by the institution.
No, I know there's more work to be done.
It all started in a dark corner of a crowded party, that bitter early winter night in Massachusetts, three friends and I asked a question that many earnest young people have pondered for ages: "What about a road trip?"
We don't know where to go or how to get there, but we do know we must set out.
Because what we've always craved, as Jack Kerouac wrote, "to dive into the boundless night, to disappear into the distant horizon." To go out and see what people across the country are up to.
So, even with voices of opposition suggesting we were taking too great a risk with little to gain, we set out anyway.
In the summer of 2013, we embarked on a cross-country journey covering 13,000 kilometers across the United States. We traversed the dairy farms of Montana, the abandoned cities of Detroit, and the swampy wetlands of New Orleans. Along the way, we met some people whom we worked for, at their small businesses they had founded, where achieving goals became the foundation of our collaboration.
After our training at "the of capitalism's West Point," we realized that this idea was nothing short of revolutionary.
This idea spread, eventually blossoming into a non-profit organization called "MBA Across America," which is is why I am able to stand here today.
It spreads because it taps into a strong desire within this generation - a hunger to achieve goals and find meaning in life.
It spreads because it taps into the countless entrepreneurs scattered across the United States, who create jobs and transform lives, needing just a little bit more support.
But to be honest, it spreads because I'm putting in all my effort to propagate it. For the dissemination of this gospel,
There's nothing I won't do to convince more people that we can heal the wounds of this broken country, relying on one small business at a time.
But it is this process of spreading the gospel that has led me to gain a somewhat different perspective on it, and today I wish to share this with you all.
Perhaps a year ago, on a fateful evening, we found gathered at the New York Museum of Natural History for an alumni dinner hosted by Harvard Business School.
Underneath a full-size model of a whale, I sat side-by side with the titans of this era, who sang praises to their comrades and their monumental achievements.
The room was filled with a sense of pride, as the total combined assets under these names exceeded five trillion dollars.
We surveyed all creation and deemed it good.
However, things happened like that, two days later, I went to Harlem, New York, and sat in a city farm, which used to be a deserted parking lot, listening to a man named Tony tell stories about some kids who would come there every day.
They were all below the poverty line.
Many people pack all their belongings into backpacksed, fearing that they might get stolen in shelters.
Some people came to Tony's farm, called "Harlem Grows", to get their single meal of the day.
Tony told me that he started "Harlem Grows" using his pension, being a taxi driver for 22 years.
He said he didn't leave himself a single dollar, because while the project was considereded successful, resources were still incredibly scarce.
He said that he would accept any help that he could find.
And I am there to assist him.
But as I left Tony, a pang of pain struck my heart, and tears welled up in my eyes.
I felt the weight of inspiration, one evening sitting in a room surrounded by thousands of people, each worth billions, discussing a better world, yet just 50 blocks away, in another room, a man without a salary struggles to provide a single meal for his child every day.
It wasn't not the harsh social inequality that made me weep, nor was it these hungry, homeless children, nor the anger towards the 1%, or the pity for the 99%.
No, my heart cannot rest because I finally realize that this nation needs a radical overhaul, and I am merely tinkering around the edges.
I realized that my story embodies a group of people who wish to be self-sufficient, even when they start from nothing; what my organization represents is the foundational, systemic help that never reachedes Harlem, or the Appalachian Mountains, or the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans; my cry represents certain voices, those that sound hollow, unrefined, out of place.
And this shame, this shame washed over me, just like the shame I felt sitting in front of the TV then, watching Peter Jennings declare the new millennium, one time, two time, three times.
I was deceived, duped, misled,
But this time, the fake savior was I myself.
You see, I came from that altar, that night I felt the world was about to collapse, from a small town where various dialects were used, thinking suffering is a gift from God to humanity, and took it as a doctrine, as eternal truth.
Yes, my journey has been so long that it has brought me back to where I started.
Because we can't simply say that this era lacks faith. No, we believe in things just as much as any other time.
Some might believe in prophecies by Brené Brown or Tony Robbins. We might subscribe to maxims from The New Yorker or Harvard Business Review.
We might be utterly convinced of what we worship in our TED temples, but we desperately crave belief, we need faith.
We emulate charismatic leaders' rhetoric and postures, promising to solve humanity's myriad problems.
We perceive suffering as a "gift" bestowed by the capitalist "God," and we revere technological advancement as a creed, as an eternal truth.
However, we never recognize the human cost of our humanitarian efforts, and we wouldn't question a single brick, fearing that the entire building might collapse.
But if you feel unease about the transgressions against nature that we have grown accustomed to, the time for questioning will inevitably arrive.
So the gospel I preach is not about breakthroughs, innovation, or sustainability.
I don't even have a gospel of faith to share with you.
What I have, is nothing but a gospel of questioning.
The gospel of questioning is not about stopping you from believing, it asks you to believe in something new: "It is possible not to believe."
It is likely that all the answers we know are wrong, and it's possible that the questions itself is flawed.
Indeed, the gospel of questioning might imply that our existence on this stage, in this room, is all wrong.
Because it raises the question, "Why?"
With such immense power at our disposal, why are there still so many people suffering?
This act of questioning led me to make a decision: my organization, "MBA Across America", would cease operations.
We've dissolved the workforce, shut the doors, and made this model accessible to everyone who feels capable of undertaking it, without needing our approval.
This act of questioning drove me to remove the "savior " crown that others had placed upon my head, for our lives are too brief and the odds are too slim for the world to await Christ's return again, the truth is, there are no miracles in this world.
And yet, this questioning drives me, it gives me hope, when the trials threaten to overwhelm us, when the paths of destiny seem to lead us astray, when our saviors cannot heal our wounds, not through our blind faith, but simply our questioning, will casts a small light into the darkness of our lives and the world, whispering to us softly.
Shouting could work, or simply saying, very simply: "There must be another way."
Thank you.
