        "new_src_summary": "The paragraph is written by Matthew Williams, a Special Olympics athlete who has achieved success in multiple sports and represented Canada internationally. He trains rigorously with professional coaches and mental performance consultants under the Special Olympics program. Despite his accomplishments, he acknowledges that people with intellectual disabilities, like himself, are often marginalized and face derogatory language, such as the use of the r-word. Williams highlights the invisibility of individuals with intellectual disabilities in society and the need for greater awareness and respect. He emphasizes that he is not seeking charity but rather advocating for recognition and equal treatment. Williams mentions the World Games, which took place earlier in the year, where over 6,500 athletes from 165 countries competed, attracting significant spectatorship and media coverage.\n\nDomain: Sports, Intellectual Disabilities, Advocacy\n\nStyle: Personal narrative, advocacy\n\nTone: Informative, passionate, assertive\n\nKey Information Preserved:\n- Matthew Williams' achievements as a Special Olympics athlete\n- Training regimen and support received\n- Marginalization faced by individuals with intellectual disabilities\n- Use of derogatory language (r-word)\n- Advocacy for recognition and equal treatment\n- Mention of the World Games and its global participation and media coverage.",
        "new_tgt_summary": "摘要：我叫马修·威廉姆斯，是一名在加拿大三项不同体育项目和全国比赛中赢得奖牌的冠军，并在国际水平上代表加拿大参加篮球比赛。我每周五天为篮球和速度滑冰训练，与顶级教练和心理表现顾问合作。这一切都是通过特奥会实现的。然而，世界并没有将像我这样的智力残疾人视为冠军。自1968年特奥会开始以来，尽管有所改变，但智力残疾人在很多情况下仍被视为隐形人。人们在我面前使用侮辱性词汇，如“弱智”，这对我和我的朋友们造成了伤害。今年，来自165个国家的6,500多名智力残疾运动员参加了在洛杉矶举行的世界运动会，但很多人并不知道这件事。我希望改变人们对智力残疾人的看法，让他们不再忽视我们。\n\n关键词：马修·威廉姆斯、冠军、加拿大、体育项目、全国比赛、篮球、特奥会、智力残疾人、歧视、侮辱性词汇、世界运动会、洛杉矶。",

Through rigorous training under professional guidance, Williams has excelled in multiple sports, demonstrating the transformative power of the Special Olympics. This organization, distinct from the Paralympics and Olympics, offers year-round sports programs that have changed lives and perceptions globally since its inception in the 1960s. Pioneers like Dr. Frank Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver challenged prevailing beliefs about the capabilities of individuals with intellectual disabilities, leading to the establishment of the Special Olympics, which now boasts over 4.5 million athletes worldwide. Williams, born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability, shares his personal journey from isolation and lack of confidence to becoming a successful athlete, participating in both the World Games and the World Summer Games. His story, alongside the experiences of thousands of others, underscores the empowering and inclusive environment fostered by the Special Olympics, inviting society to view these athletes as equals deserving of respect and equal treatment.",

        "new_src_summary": "Matthew Williams, a distinguished Special Olympics athlete with a history of representing Canada on the global stage, fervently champions the cause of equal treatment and recognition for individuals with intellectual disabilities, a community frequently marginalized and subjected to demeaning language. Born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability, Williams' journey from isolation to success exemplifies the transformative potential of the Special Olympics, an organization distinct from the Paralympics and Olympics, which has been changing lives and perceptions since the 1960s. With over 4.5 million athletes worldwide, the Special Olympics, founded by visionaries like Dr. Frank Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, provides year-round sports programs that not only empower participants but also address significant health disparities. By promoting physical activity, educating on nutrition, and offering free health screenings, Special Olympics combats the reduced life expectancy faced by individuals with intellectual disabilities. A poignant example is the Nigerian basketball team at the 2015 World Summer Games, whose confidence soared after receiving hearing aids, enabling full engagement in the sport. Beyond enhancing athletic abilities, Special Olympics challenges societal ignorance and stigma, advocating for a more inclusive world where these athletes are viewed as equals deserving of respect. Recent studies underscore the need for greater understanding and acceptance among the general public, as many Americans lack personal connections with people having intellectual disabilities. In light of this, the organization also confronts the persistent use of derogatory terms, urging society to witness the transformative impact of the Special Olympics firsthand, fostering an environment of empowerment, inclusivity, and equal treatment.",
        "new_tgt_summary": "合并后的摘要：我是马修·威廉姆斯，一位加拿大籍的智力残疾运动员，在全国比赛中屡获殊荣，并代表加拿大在国际舞台上展现篮球风采。每周五天，我全身心投入篮球和速度滑冰的训练，与顶尖教练和心理表现顾问紧密合作，这一切都归功于特奥会——一个为智力残疾运动员提供展示舞台的非凡组织。尽管自1968年成立以来，特奥会已推动了诸多积极变化，但智力残疾人仍面临社会的忽视和歧视。人们在我们面前使用侮辱性词汇，如“弱智”，这深深地伤害了我和我的朋友们。今年，6,500多名来自165个国家的智力残疾运动员齐聚洛杉矶参加世界运动会，但这场盛会并未得到应有的关注。我希望借此机会改变社会对智力残疾人的看法，让世人认识到我们的价值和潜力。\n\n我的故事起始于特奥会，这个组织不仅重塑了我的自信，还帮助我建立了珍贵的友谊，并在篮球和速滑项目上取得了辉煌成就，最终代表加拿大参加了世界夏季运动会。尽管我生来就患有癫痫和智力障碍，这使我成长过程中充满了挑战，难以与同龄人保持同步，但特奥会给予了我坚定的支持和鼓励，让我能够做回真实的自己，不再受外界评判。特奥会改变了世界对智力残疾人的看法，证明了我们在体育竞技中同样能够取得成功。作为全球超过450万名特奥会运动员中的一员，我分享了众多类似的成功故事，强调了特奥会对提升智力残疾人生活质量的重要作用。\n\n特奥会的起源可以追溯到20世纪60年代，当时多伦多大学的科学家弗兰克·海登博士的研究揭示，定期锻炼能显著提升智力残疾儿童的身体素质，这一发现打破了当时普遍认为智力残疾人无法从体育活动中受益的错误观念。特奥会的创始人尤尼斯·肯尼迪·施赖弗等先驱者的不懈努力，使得特奥会得以成立，为智力残疾运动员提供了展示才华和能力的平台，逐步扭转了社会对智力残疾人的刻板印象。\n\n特奥会不仅为运动员提供了恢复自豪感和尊严的平台，也关注并改善了智力残疾人群体的健康需求。研究表明，智力残疾人士的平均寿命普遍短于非智力残疾人士。为了改善这一状况，特奥会通过体育活动促进运动员的身体健康，并教育他们有关营养和健康的知识。同时，特奥会为与医生沟通困难或难以获得医疗服务的运动员提供免费的健康筛查。以2015年世界夏季运动会为例，尼日利亚篮球队在健康筛查中，有七名队员免费获得了助听器，这极大地改变了他们的情绪状态和自信心，使他们能够更好地与教练交流，体验到篮球比赛中的各种声音。特奥会的影响远超体育领域，它在改变运动员的生活方式，提升他们的生活质量。在美国，约有一半的成年人并不了解智力残疾人，缺乏个人接触的人群对智力残疾人的接纳度较低。“弱智”等词汇的使用反映了智力残疾人在社会中的边缘化地位，这种词语的随意使用和侮辱性言辞深深伤害了特奥会运动员的情感。特奥会邀请所有人加入其大家庭，呼吁改变对智力残疾人的偏见，希望人们在参与后能有更深刻的理解和同情。特奥会是一个倡导包容、平等和尊重的社区，它正在努力消除智力残疾人的社会障碍，让每个人都有机会展现自己的能力和价值。",
