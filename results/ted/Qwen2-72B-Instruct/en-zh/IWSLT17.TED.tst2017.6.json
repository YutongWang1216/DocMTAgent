The author highlights the contradiction between the public mourning of the death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi and the subsequent drowning of over 200 children in the Mediterranean. They criticize the fact that international treaties recognizing refugees as a shared responsibility have not been upheld, with tiny Lebanon hosting more Syrians than the whole of Europe combined. The author also points out that while there are labor shortages, people who fit economic and demographic needs are excluded from coming to Europe. The paragraph further highlights repressive policies such as detaining child asylum seekers, separating children from their families, and seizing property from refugees. The author argues that the current system is not working due to a lack of vision from politicians on how to adapt the international refugee system created over 50 years ago for a changing and globalized world. The modern refugee regime, established after World War II through the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees signed by 147 governments, aimed to ensure that people fleeing conflict and persecution have somewhere to go and can live in safety and dignity until they can return home.\n\nDomain: The paragraph falls under the domain of political and social commentary, specifically focusing on the European response to the refugee crisis.\n\nStyle: The style of the paragraph is persuasive and critical, using rhetorical questions and emotional appeals to highlight the inadequacies of the current system and call for change.\n\nTone: The tone of the paragraph is one of frustration, disappointment, and urgency, conveying a sense of moral outrage at the inhumane treatment of refugees and the failure of the current system to address their needs. The author's tone shifts towards a more hopeful and constructive tone towards the end, as they propose fundamental questions to guide potential solutions.",

        "new_src_summary": "The merged summary retains the essence of both paragraphs while preserving the domain, style, and tone:\n\nIn a poignant critique of Europe's handling of the refugee crisis, the author laments the stark disparity between public displays of sympathy for victims like Alan Kurdi and the ongoing tragedies unfolding in the Mediterranean, where over 200 children have drowned since his death. Despite international agreements designating refugees as a collective responsibility, the reality is grim; Lebanon alone hosts more Syrian refugees than the entire continent of Europe. This discrepancy underscores the hypocrisy in excluding individuals who could potentially fill labor shortages from entering Europe. The author denounces repressive measures such as detaining child asylum seekers, separating families, and confiscating refugees' belongings, all indicative of a failing system lacking political vision to adapt to the demands of a globalized world. The post-WWII refugee regime, established through the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees, aimed to provide safety and dignity to those fleeing conflict, yet its principles are not being upheld. The system's shortcomings are exemplified by the case of Amira, a Syrian woman unable to return to her destroyed hometown of Homs and facing slim prospects of resettlement. The author asserts that the problem lies not in the rules themselves, but in their inadequate application to a rapidly evolving world, leaving refugees in a state of perpetual uncertainty and burdening countries closest to conflict zones. This critical analysis calls for a fundamental reassessment of the international refugee system, urging policymakers to address the urgent need for reform and compassion.",
        "new_tgt_summary": "合并后的摘要：过去一年，欧洲面对超过百万寻求庇护者涌入的挑战，其应对策略既矛盾又令人失望。尽管表达了对艾兰·库尔迪等遇难儿童的悲痛，但后续仍有200多名儿童在地中海丧生。国际条约虽承认难民责任，但小国如黎巴嫩接纳的叙利亚难民数量已超过整个欧洲。欧洲正面临劳动力短缺，却拒绝接纳符合其经济与人口需求的难民。尽管宣称反对伊斯兰原教旨主义并支持自由价值观，欧洲却实施了压制性政策，包括拘留儿童寻求庇护者、拆散家庭以及没收难民财产。这些失败归咎于政治家缺乏远见，未能在全球化世界中调整难民体系。现代难民制度建基于二战后，旨在为因国家失败或迫害而流离失所的人提供安全与尊严。1951年的《难民地位公约》及联合国难民署的设立体现了各国承诺保护逃离冲突与迫害的人士。然而，现有体系难以有效应对如叙利亚危机般的挑战，急需重新审视与改革。\n\n理论上，当前难民体系应确保难民权益，包括寻求庇护、获得融入途径或返回原籍国的权利，但实践上却屡屡受挫。邻近冲突地区的国家因地理位置而承受了全球大部分难民的压力。问题并非出在规则本身，而是我们未能与时俱进地调整规则以适应变化的世界。以叙利亚妇女阿米拉为例，她象征着众多无法重返家园的难民。阿米拉来自被摧毁的霍姆斯市，无法返回家乡，同时面临极低的第三方国家重新安置机会。在几乎无望的境况下，阿米拉及其家人被迫在有限的选项中作出抉择，这凸显了难民制度的实际局限性和难民个体面临的艰难现实。",

        "new_src_summary": "In a critical and concerned analysis of the European refugee crisis, the author contrasts the public's sympathetic response to incidents like the tragic fate of Alan Kurdi with the ongoing and often overlooked tragedies in the Mediterranean, where over 200 children have perished since Kurdi's death. Despite international agreements that designate refugees as a shared responsibility, the reality is far from ideal, with Lebanon hosting more Syrian refugees than the entirety of Europe, highlighting the hypocrisy in restricting entry to individuals who could alleviate labor shortages. The author denounces the repressive measures employed against refugees, such as detaining child asylum seekers, separating families, and confiscating belongings, which reveal a failing system devoid of political foresight to adjust to the demands of globalization. Drawing attention to the shortcomings of the post-WWII refugee regime established through the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees, the author uses the case of Amira, a Syrian woman caught between an unreturnable homeland and uncertain prospects of resettlement, to illustrate the system's failure. The problem, the author contends, is not with the rules themselves but with their insufficient application to a rapidly changing world, resulting in perpetual uncertainty for refugees and undue burden on countries nearest to conflict zones. This critical examination urges policymakers to fundamentally reassess the international refugee system and advocate for reform and compassion. The author further explores the harrowing choices facing refugees like Amira, who must decide between living in harsh refugee camps, struggling in urban areas without adequate support or embarking on perilous journeys to seek safety elsewhere, calling for a reconsideration of these restrictive options within the global refugee regime.",
        "new_tgt_summary": "过去一年，欧洲面对超过百万寻求庇护者的涌入，其应对策略充满矛盾且令人失望。尽管表达了对艾兰·库尔迪等遇难儿童的悲痛，后续仍有200多名儿童在地中海丧生。国际条约虽承认难民责任，但小国如黎巴嫩接纳的叙利亚难民数量已超过整个欧洲。欧洲正面临劳动力短缺，却拒绝接纳符合其经济与人口需求的难民。尽管宣称反对伊斯兰原教旨主义并支持自由价值观，欧洲却实施了压制性政策，包括拘留儿童寻求庇护者、拆散家庭以及没收难民财产。这些失败归咎于政治家缺乏远见，未能在全球化世界中调整难民体系。现代难民制度建基于二战后，旨在为因国家失败或迫害而流离失所的人提供安全与尊严。然而，现有体系难以有效应对如叙利亚危机般的挑战，急需重新审视与改革。\n\n全球难民制度迫使叙利亚难民阿米拉面临三个艰难的选择：一是进入难民营，虽有机会获得援助，但未来渺茫，生活环境恶劣，多数难民需滞留五年以上；二是移居邻国城市，如安曼或贝鲁特，但常缺乏工作权，援助不足，最终可能陷入城市赤贫；三是冒险前往他国，寻求希望，导致当前欧洲难民危机。这种几乎不可能的选择反映了当前全球难民制度的现状，但被认为是虚假的选择，迫切需要重新审视和改善难民面临的处境，确保他们能够获得安全、尊严和真正选择的机会。",

        "new_src_summary": "In a poignant critique of the European refugee crisis, the author juxtaposes the public's selective empathy towards high-profile tragedies like the heartrending story of Alan Kurdi with the less-publicized but equally devastating plights faced by refugees in the Mediterranean, where over 200 children have lost their lives since Kurdi's death. Despite international agreements that proclaim a collective responsibility for refugees, the reality starkly contrasts, with Lebanon shouldering a heavier burden of Syrian refugees than the entire continent of Europe, underscoring the paradoxical nature of restricting entry to those who could potentially address labor shortages. The author vehemently condemns the repressive tactics used against refugees, including the detention of child asylum seekers, family separation, and asset confiscation, which symbolize a broken system lacking in political vision to adapt to the demands of globalization. By scrutinizing the inadequacies of the post-WWII refugee framework established via the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees, the author employs the narrative of Amira, a Syrian woman trapped between an unsafe homeland and an uncertain future of resettlement, to exemplify the system's failure. The core issue, the author asserts, lies not in the rules themselves but in their inadequate application to an ever-evolving world, leading to perpetual instability for refugees and excessive strain on nations closest to conflict zones. This critical assessment implores policymakers to fundamentally reevaluate the international refugee system, urging reform and compassion. The author also delves into the grim decisions confronting refugees akin to Amira, who face the harrowing choice between enduring life in austere refugee camps, grappling with survival in urban settings without sufficient support, or undertaking treacherous voyages in search of sanctuary, advocating for a reevaluation of these constrained alternatives within the global refugee regime. Contrary to popular misconceptions portraying refugees as societal burdens, the author champions an expanded choice set for refugees beyond the narrow options typically outlined by policymakers. Citing a study in Uganda, the author showcases the positive impact of providing refugees with economic opportunities and freedom of movement, resulting in job creation for local populations and flourishing enterprises within the camps. The author proposes four strategies to revolutionize our perception of refugees, all leveraging globalization, mobility, and market forces. The initial strategy entails cultivating an environment that acknowledges refugees as human beings in extraordinary circumstances, empowering them to make valuable contributions to society. This transformation is illustrated through examples of successful businesses established by refugees in Uganda, mutually benefiting both the refugees and the host community. Throughout this discourse, the author maintains an optimistic and solution-oriented tone, urging a rethinking of the restrictive options within the global refugee regime and emphasizing the potential for refugees to thrive when granted the chance.",
        "new_tgt_summary": "过去一年，欧洲面临超过百万难民的涌入，其应对策略充满矛盾与失望，尽管表达了对遇难儿童的悲痛，后续仍有200多名儿童在地中海丧生。国际条约虽承认难民责任，但小国如黎巴嫩接纳的叙利亚难民数量已超过整个欧洲。欧洲正面临劳动力短缺，却拒绝接纳符合其经济与人口需求的难民，实施了包括拘留儿童、拆散家庭以及没收难民财产在内的压制性政策。这些失败归咎于政治家缺乏远见，未能在全球化世界中调整难民体系。现代难民制度建基于二战后，旨在为因国家失败或迫害而流离失所的人提供安全与尊严，但现有体系难以有效应对如叙利亚危机般的挑战，急需重新审视与改革。全球难民制度迫使叙利亚难民阿米拉面临三个艰难的选择：难民营、移居邻国城市或冒险前往他国，这种几乎不可能的选择反映了当前全球难民制度的现状，但被认为是虚假的选择，迫切需要重新审视和改善难民面临的处境，确保他们能够获得安全、尊严和真正选择的机会。\n\n然而，难民问题不应被看作零和博弈，也不应仅仅被视为社会成本或负担。实际上，难民有能力做出积极贡献。通过营造有利环境，给予难民经济机会，包括工作权利和行动自由，可以促进东道国社区的发展，如乌干达的做法。在乌干达首都坎帕拉，21%的难民拥有雇佣其他人的企业，其中40%的员工是东道国国民。即使在难民营中，也涌现出充满活力和创新的企业，如刚果难民经营的数字音乐交换业务，以及一位卢旺达企业家利用回收设备提供电脑游戏服务。总之，难民在极端限制下展现出创新精神，为东道国公民创造了就业机会，这为全球难民制度的改革提供了新的视角和可能性。",

        "new_src_summary": "In a compelling critique of the European refugee crisis, the author contrasts the public's selective empathy for high-profile tragedies, like the tragic story of Alan Kurdi, with the less-publicized but equally devastating plight of refugees in the Mediterranean, where over 200 children have perished since Kurdi's death. Despite international agreements that proclaim a shared responsibility for refugees, the reality starkly contrasts, with Lebanon bearing a heavier burden of Syrian refugees than the entire continent of Europe. The author denounces repressive tactics against refugees, including the detention of child asylum seekers, family separation, and asset confiscation, which highlight a broken system lacking in political vision to adapt to the demands of globalization. Scrutinizing the inadequacies of the post-WWII refugee framework established via the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees, the author uses the narrative of Amira, a Syrian woman, to exemplify the system's failure. The core issue, the author contends, lies not in the rules themselves but in their inadequate application to an ever-evolving world, leading to perpetual instability for refugees and excessive strain on nations closest to conflict zones. This critical assessment urges policymakers to fundamentally reevaluate the international refugee system, advocating for reform and compassion. The author also delves into the grim choices confronting refugees, akin to Amira, who face the harrowing decision between enduring life in austere refugee camps, grappling with survival in urban settings without sufficient support, or undertaking perilous voyages in search of sanctuary. Contrary to common misconceptions portraying refugees as societal burdens, the author champions an expanded choice set for refugees beyond the narrow options typically outlined by policymakers. Citing a study in Uganda, the author demonstrates the positive impact of providing refugees with economic opportunities and freedom of movement, resulting in job creation for local populations and thriving enterprises within the camps. The author proposes four strategies to revolutionize our perception of refugees, all leveraging globalization, mobility, and market forces, and maintains an optimistic and solution-oriented tone throughout.\n\nThe narrative then shifts to the inspiring story of Demou-Kay, a refugee who arrived in a settlement with few resources but managed to start a community radio station, rent a video camera, and create a successful filmmaking business. This example underscores the potential for refugees to flourish given opportunities for human flourishing beyond basic humanitarian aid. The author argues that instead of viewing refugees solely as dependents, society should offer them connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, and access to capital and banking, essentially integrating them into the global economy. The author introduces the concept of economic zones as a solution for refugees, particularly in countries that do not fully open their economies to them. A proposed economic zone near the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan would allow refugees to work alongside Jordanian nationals, providing labor while benefiting from vocational training and the opportunity to support their families. This initiative could contribute to Jordan's national development strategy and prepare refugees to play a role in the post-conflict reconstruction of Syria. This idea, published in Foreign Affairs, has garnered attention from King Abdullah, showcasing a promising approach to refugee policy and economic integration.",
        "new_tgt_summary": "过去一年，欧洲面临的百万难民潮暴露出其应对策略的矛盾与局限，尽管表达了对遇难儿童的悲痛，后续仍有200多名儿童在地中海丧生。国际条约虽认可难民责任，但小国如黎巴嫩接纳的叙利亚难民数量已超过整个欧洲。欧洲正面临劳动力短缺，却拒绝接纳符合其经济与人口需求的难民，实施了包括拘留儿童、拆散家庭以及没收难民财产在内的压制性政策。这些失败归咎于政治家缺乏远见，未能在全球化世界中调整难民体系。现代难民制度建基于二战后，旨在为因国家失败或迫害而流离失所的人提供安全与尊严，但现有体系难以有效应对如叙利亚危机般的挑战，急需重新审视与改革。全球难民制度迫使叙利亚难民阿米拉面临三个艰难的选择：难民营、移居邻国城市或冒险前往他国，这种几乎不可能的选择反映了当前全球难民制度的现状，但被认为是虚假的选择，迫切需要重新审视和改善难民面临的处境，确保他们能够获得安全、尊严和真正选择的机会。\n\n然而，难民问题不应被视为零和博弈或社会负担。实际上，难民有能力做出积极贡献。通过营造有利环境，给予难民经济机会，包括工作权利和行动自由，可以促进东道国社区的发展。乌干达的例子显示，21%的难民在首都坎帕拉拥有雇佣其他人的企业，其中40%的员工是东道国国民。即使在难民营中，也涌现出充满活力和创新的企业。难民在极端限制下展现出创新精神，为东道国公民创造了就业机会，这为全球难民制度的改革提供了新的视角和可能性。\n\n德莫-凯的故事进一步强调了这一点，他在抵达定居点时几乎身无分文，但凭借决心和努力，与朋友和同事一起创办了社区广播电台，并开始制作电影，展现了从有限资源中创造成功事业的可能性。在紧急阶段，基本需求如衣物、毛毯、住所和食物至关重要，但长期视角下，提供连通性、电力、教育、工作权利、资本获取和银行业务的机会同等重要，以确保难民能够接入全球经济。\n\n经济特区的概念提供了另一种解决方案。在约旦，构想中的经济特区旨在结合难民和当地国民的就业，以支持国家发展战略。例如，侯赛因·本·塔拉勒发展区已投入巨资进行基础设施建设，但缺乏劳动力准入和外来投资。若能允许难民在此工作，不仅能改善其生活状况，还能促进约旦的制造业发展，同时为叙利亚战后重建培养关键人才。这一构想得到了约旦国王阿卜杜拉的认可和支持。\n\n综上所述，面对难民问题，应超越单纯的人道主义援助，转向提供实现自立和繁荣的途径，包括经济特区等创新模式，以促进难民、收容国和冲突后国家的共同发展。难民有能力为东道国带来经济和社会价值，通过提供必要的资源和支持，可以实现双赢的局面。",

Highlighting the disparity between international agreements on shared refugee responsibility and the reality, where Lebanon shoulders more Syrian refugees than all of Europe combined, the author denounces oppressive measures against refugees, including child detention, family separation, and asset confiscation, exposing a flawed system lacking political foresight for globalization's demands. By scrutinizing the post-WWII refugee framework, embodied in the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees, and using Amira's story as a case study, the author underscores the systemic failure due to inadequate adaptation to a changing world, causing continuous turmoil for refugees and undue pressure on nations near conflict areas. Urging policymakers to reassess the international refugee system fundamentally, the author advocates for reform and compassion, emphasizing the need to broaden refugees' choices beyond mere survival in camps, urban hardship, or perilous voyages. Contradicting stereotypes that label refugees as burdens, the author showcases a Ugandan study demonstrating the positive economic impacts of granting refugees opportunities and freedom of movement, fostering job creation and thriving businesses. Four strategies are proposed to transform our perception of refugees, leveraging globalization, mobility, and market forces, with an optimistic, solution-focused tone.\n\nThe narrative transitions to the inspiring journey of Demou-Kay, a refugee who, despite arriving with scarce resources, established a community radio station, rented a video camera, and launched a successful filmmaking business, illustrating the potential for refugees to prosper when provided opportunities for growth beyond basic humanitarian assistance. The author suggests offering refugees connectivity, electricity, education, work rights, and access to capital and banking, integrating them into the global economy instead of viewing them solely as dependents. Economic zones are proposed as a solution for refugees in countries with restricted economies, exemplified by a planned zone near Jordan's Zaatari camp, enabling refugees to work with Jordanians, receive vocational training, and financially support their families. This initiative aligns with Jordan's national development strategy and prepares refugees for roles in Syria's post-conflict reconstruction. This concept, featured in Foreign Affairs and drawing interest from King Abdullah, represents a promising approach to refugee policy and economic integration.\n\nTo enhance the current refugee handling system, four innovative ideas are presented. First, a pilot program at the London Syria Conference proposes preference matching between states and refugees, akin to economist Alvin Roth's matching markets theory, increasing resettlement success rates. This involves refugees ranking their desired destinations and states selecting refugees based on skills or language, incorporating quotas for diversity and vulnerability. Second, matching markets at the national level aim to convince local communities to welcome refugees by aligning the preferences of both parties. Third, humanitarian visas would permit refugees to travel directly to Europe for asylum without risking dangerous journeys, implemented through a visa system in neighboring countries, potentially saving lives and reducing smuggling fees. With a formal, clear, and concise style, this discourse on refugee policy addresses resettlement and asylum challenges in Europe, proposing creative solutions to enhance the system and facilitate better outcomes for refugees.",
        "new_tgt_summary": "过去一年，欧洲面对百万难民潮暴露了其应对策略的矛盾与局限，尽管表达了对遇难儿童的悲痛，后续仍有200多名儿童在地中海丧生。国际条约虽认可难民责任，但小国如黎巴嫩接纳的叙利亚难民数量已超过整个欧洲。欧洲正面临劳动力短缺，却拒绝接纳符合其经济与人口需求的难民，实施了包括拘留儿童、拆散家庭以及没收难民财产在内的压制性政策。这些失败归咎于政治家缺乏远见，未能在全球化世界中调整难民体系。现代难民制度建基于二战后，旨在为因国家失败或迫害而流离失所的人提供安全与尊严，但现有体系难以有效应对如叙利亚危机般的挑战，急需重新审视与改革。全球难民制度迫使叙利亚难民阿米拉面临三个艰难的选择：难民营、移居邻国城市或冒险前往他国，这种几乎不可能的选择反映了当前全球难民制度的现状，但被认为是虚假的选择，迫切需要重新审视和改善难民面临的处境，确保他们能够获得安全、尊严和真正选择的机会。然而，难民问题不应被视为零和博弈或社会负担。实际上，难民有能力做出积极贡献。通过营造有利环境，给予难民经济机会，包括工作权利和行动自由，可以促进东道国社区的发展。乌干达的例子显示，21%的难民在首都坎帕拉拥有雇佣其他人的企业，其中40%的员工是东道国国民。即使在难民营中，也涌现出充满活力和创新的企业。难民在极端限制下展现出创新精神，为东道国公民创造了就业机会，这为全球难民制度的改革提供了新的视角和可能性。德莫-凯的故事进一步强调了这一点，他在抵达定居点时几乎身无分文，但凭借决心和努力，与朋友和同事一起创办了社区广播电台，并开始制作电影，展现了从有限资源中创造成功事业的可能性。在紧急阶段，基本需求如衣物、毛毯、住所和食物至关重要，但长期视角下，提供连通性、电力、教育、工作权利、资本获取和银行业务的机会同等重要，以确保难民能够接入全球经济。经济特区的概念提供了另一种解决方案。在约旦，构想中的经济特区旨在结合难民和当地国民的就业，以支持国家发展战略。例如，侯赛因·本·塔拉勒发展区已投入巨资进行基础设施建设，但缺乏劳动力准入和外来投资。若能允许难民在此工作，不仅能改善其生活状况，还能促进约旦的制造业发展，同时为叙利亚战后重建培养关键人才。这一构想得到了约旦国王阿卜杜拉的认可和支持。综上所述，面对难民问题，应超越单纯的人道主义援助，转向提供实现自立和繁荣的途径，包括经济特区等创新模式，以促进难民、收容国和冲突后国家的共同发展。难民有能力为东道国带来经济和社会价值，通过提供必要的资源和支持，可以实现双赢的局面。\n\n在两周前的伦敦叙利亚会议上宣布的计划中，试点项目将于夏季启动。提出的想法之一是在国家和难民之间进行偏好匹配，以改善难民安置的结果。经济学家阿尔文·罗斯的匹配市场理论可以应用于难民问题，通过让难民排序其首选目的地，同时允许各国根据技能或语言标准排序他们想要接纳的难民类型，实现更好的匹配。匹配理念已在学生与大学录取、肾脏捐赠者与患者配对等领域取得成功，也可用于婚恋网站的算法。匹配市场可以结合接待难民的人口和难民本身的偏好，解决国家层面的挑战，如合理分配难民到适合的地区。\n\n此外，提出的人道主义签证概念可以避免欧洲庇护政策中的根本矛盾，即难民必须自行踏上危险旅程才能到达欧洲寻求庇护。在现代领事能力和廉价航空的时代，这种旅程是不必要的，导致了大量人员伤亡。通过人道主义签证，允许难民在邻国的大使馆或领事馆申请签证，直接前往欧洲，乘坐渡轮或飞机，可以避免这些悲剧的发生。例如，从土耳其偷渡到希腊岛屿大约需要一千欧元，而从博德鲁姆乘坐廉价航空公司飞往法兰克福只需要200欧元。允许难民通过这种方式旅行将带来重大优势。\n\n综合以上内容，欧洲及全球难民危机揭示了现有体系的不足，需要采取更加全面和前瞻性的方法来应对。难民不仅仅是负担，他们拥有潜力为东道国创造经济和社会价值。通过创新的解决方案，如偏好匹配系统和人道主义签证，可以改善难民的安置过程，减少旅途中的风险，同时满足接收国的需求。经济特区的设立为难民提供了工作机会，促进了当地的经济发展，为难民和收容国带来了双赢的局面。这些措施不仅有助于缓解难民危机，也为构建更加公正和包容的全球难民制度奠定了基础。",
