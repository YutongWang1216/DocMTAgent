The author explains that while they would ideally spread out their work over time, they often ended up cramming at the last minute. When faced with a 90-page senior thesis, the author recognized the need for a different approach and planned out a schedule that involved starting lightly and gradually increasing effort until the end. However, the author admits that even with this plan, they still struggled to make progress during the early months and had to revise their strategy.\n\nMain Contents: The author's experience as a college government major who struggled with procrastination while writing papers, their ideal plan for spreading out work over time, their typical pattern of cramming at the last minute, and their attempt to plan out a schedule for a 90-page senior thesis that involved gradually increasing effort until the end.\n\nDomain: Education/College\n\nStyle: Casual and humorous\n\nTone: Self-deprecating and lighthearted.",

        "new_src_summary": "In a lighthearted and self-deprecating tone, the author, Tim Urban, shares his experiences as a college government major who often found himself struggling with procrastination when it came to writing papers. Despite his best intentions to spread out his work over time, he frequently found himself cramming at the last minute. This pattern continued until he faced the daunting task of completing a 90-page senior thesis. Recognizing the need for a new approach, Tim attempted to plan out a schedule that involved starting lightly and gradually increasing his efforts until the end. However, even with this plan, he still struggled to make progress during the early months and had to revise his strategy. Tim humorously recounts how he eventually wrote the entire thesis in just 72 hours, only to receive negative feedback on its quality. Despite this setback, he decided to turn his experience into a learning opportunity by writing about procrastination on his blog, Wait But Why, aiming to help non-procrastinators understand the mindset of procrastinators. Tim hypothesized that the brains of procrastinators differ from those of non-procrastinators and conducted an experiment by scanning his own brain and that of a non-procrastinator for comparison. Through his humorous and relatable storytelling, Tim provides insight into the psychology of procrastination and offers a playful, yet informative perspective on the topic.",

        "new_src_summary": "In a light-hearted and self-deprecating tone, Tim Urban, the author of Wait But Why, shares his personal experiences with procrastination, particularly during his time as a college government major. Despite his intentions to manage his workload efficiently, Tim often found himself succumbing to last-minute cramming, culminating in the overwhelming challenge of writing a 90-page senior thesis. Attempting to break the cycle, Tim devised a gradual increase strategy but still struggled to make headway, ultimately churning out the entire thesis in a frenzied 72-hour marathon. Though met with criticism for its quality, Tim turned this experience into a learning opportunity by exploring the psychology of procrastination on his blog. Hypothesizing that procrastinators' brains function differently, he conducted an experiment comparing his brain scans with those of a non-procrastinator. Through his humorous and relatable narrative, Tim introduces the concept of the Rational Decision-Maker present in all brains, but highlights the unique presence of the Instant Gratification Monkey in procrastinators' minds. This whimsical character, driven by short-term pleasure, commandeers attention away from important tasks, leading to distractions like aimlessly browsing the internet or indulging in unproductive activities. By employing anthropomorphic figures and a playful yet informative style, Tim offers valuable insights into the complex behavioral patterns of procrastination, making the subject engaging and accessible to readers.",

        "new_src_summary": "In a lighthearted and self-deprecating tone, Tim Urban, the author of Wait But Why, explores the psychology of procrastination through his own experiences and anthropomorphic analogies, making the subject engaging and accessible to readers. Urban humorously contrasts the simple goals of a dog's life with the complex challenges faced by humans due to the presence of the \"Rational Decision-Maker\" in their brains, which allows us to visualize the future, consider the big picture, and make long-term plans, unlike any other animal. He shares his personal struggle with procrastination during his time as a college government major, including the daunting task of writing a 90-page senior thesis, which he completed in a frenzied 72-hour marathon. Through his humorous and relatable narrative, Urban introduces the concept of the Rational Decision-Maker present in all brains, but highlights the unique presence of the Instant Gratification Monkey in procrastinators' minds. This whimsical character, driven by short-term pleasure, commandeers attention away from important tasks, leading to distractions like aimlessly browsing the internet or indulging in unproductive activities. The author describes a common conflict between the immediate desires of the \"Monkey\" and the Rational Decision-Maker, which often leads procrastinators to spend excessive time in the \"Dark Playground,\" a metaphorical space where leisure activities occur at inappropriate times. By employing anthropomorphic figures and a playful yet informative style, Urban offers valuable insights into the complex behavioral patterns of procrastination, making the subject both educational and entertaining.",

        "new_src_summary": "In a lighthearted and self-deprecating tone, Tim Urban, author of Wait But Why, delves into the psychology of procrastination using anthropomorphic analogies and personal anecdotes, making the subject both engaging and accessible. Urban humorously contrasts the straightforward goals of a dog's life with the complex challenges faced by humans, thanks to the \"Rational Decision-Maker\" in our brains, which enables us to visualize the future, consider the big picture, and make long-term plans. Through his humorous narrative, Urban shares his own struggles with procrastination, such as completing a 90-page senior thesis in a frenzied 72-hour marathon, while introducing the whimsical Instant Gratification Monkey, a character that represents the short-term pleasure-seeking aspect of procrastinators' minds. This Monkey often commandeers attention away from important tasks, leading to distractions and unproductive activities in the \"Dark Playground,\" a metaphorical space where leisure activities occur at inappropriate times, causing feelings of guilt, dread, anxiety, and self-hatred.\n\nUrban further personifies the procrastinator's decision-making process through the roles of three entities: the Monkey, the Rational Decision-Maker, and the Panic Monster, a guardian angel-like figure that awakens when deadlines approach or significant consequences loom, instilling fear in the Monkey and allowing the Rational Decision-Maker to regain control. Using a personal anecdote about preparing for a TED conference, Urban demonstrates how the Monkey can be distracted by trivial activities until the Panic Monster forces it to retreat, enabling the Rational Decision-Maker to take charge and begin preparing for important tasks.\n\nThis narrative-driven, self-help and motivational writing style blends humor with insightful commentary on the psychology of procrastination, offering a creative perspective on overcoming the habit. Key information includes the roles of the three personified entities in the procrastination process and the circumstances that lead to productive action.",
        "new_tgt_summary": "蒂姆·厄本，曾是一名政府学专业的学生和重度拖延症患者，在面临90页高年级论文挑战时，经历了72小时的疯狂赶工，这一经历不仅未终结他的拖延习惯，反而激发了他对拖延症的深入研究。在他的博客“等等，为什么”上，厄本以幽默方式探讨了拖延者的思维和行为模式，揭示了大脑中追求即时满足的“猴子”与理性决策者之间的冲突。他指出，拖延者常常被困在“黑暗游乐场”，一个充满罪恶感、恐惧和焦虑的地方，这源于猴子对简单快乐的追求，忽视了未来规划的重要性。然而，拖延者并非无力抵抗，他们拥有“恐慌怪兽”作为内在守护者，当面对截止日期或重大风险时，恐慌怪兽会被唤醒，驱散猴子，促使理性决策者采取行动。厄本以自己接到TED演讲邀请为例，展示了从初始的拖延到最终通过内在恐慌感激发行动的过程，强调了理解拖延症本质及其应对策略的重要性，帮助人们走出拖延的循环，实现目标。",

        "new_src_summary": "In a lighthearted yet reflective narrative, Tim Urban, author of Wait But Why, explores the psychology of procrastination using anthropomorphic analogies and personal anecdotes, creating an engaging and accessible discussion on the topic. Urban humorously juxtaposes the simple objectives of a dog's life with the intricate challenges faced by humans due to our ability to visualize the future and make long-term plans, thanks to the \"Rational Decision-Maker.\" He shares his struggles with procrastination, such as completing a 90-page thesis in 72 frantic hours, while introducing the whimsical Instant Gratification Monkey, a character symbolizing the short-term pleasure-seeking nature of procrastinators. This Monkey frequently diverts attention from crucial tasks, leading to distractions and unproductive activities in the \"Dark Playground,\" a metaphorical area where leisure activities occur at inopportune times, evoking feelings of guilt, dread, anxiety, and self-loathing.\n\nUrban elaborates on the procrastinator's decision-making process through the roles of three personified entities: the Monkey, the Rational Decision-Maker, and the Panic Monster. The Panic Monster, akin to a guardian angel, awakens as deadlines approach or significant consequences loom, instilling fear in the Monkey and permitting the Rational Decision-Maker to reclaim control. Urban uses a personal story about preparing for a TED conference to illustrate how the Monkey can be sidetracked by trivial pursuits until the Panic Monster compels it to withdraw, allowing the Rational Decision-Maker to assume command and commence preparations for vital tasks.\n\nUrban's narrative-driven, self-help and motivational writing style blends humor with insightful commentary on the psychology of procrastination, providing a creative viewpoint on conquering the habit. He emphasizes the roles of the three personified entities in the procrastination process and the conditions that lead to productive action. After publishing his thoughts on this topic on a blog, Urban received countless responses from individuals globally, expressing frustration over how procrastination adversely affected their lives. He differentiates between two procrastination types: one with deadlines (addressable by the Panic Monster) and another without, impacting long-term goals and personal well-being. In scenarios lacking external pressures, the Panic Monster fails to inspire, resulting in ongoing procrastination.\n\nThe informal, anecdotal, and explanatory style, combined with a tone that is both slightly humorous and seriously reflective, makes Urban's discussion on procrastination relatable and insightful. The focus remains on the behavioral science domain, highlighting the complexity of human decision-making processes and the struggle to overcome procrastination's negative effects.",
        "new_tgt_summary": "合并后的摘要：蒂姆·厄本，一名前政府学专业学生及重度拖延症患者，通过自身经历90页高年级论文的紧急赶制，激发了他对拖延症现象的深度探索。在其博客“等等，为什么”中，厄班采用幽默手法剖析了拖延者内心的复杂动态，揭示了即时满足寻求者“猴子”与理性决策者间的矛盾，以及拖延者常陷于“黑暗游乐场”的焦虑状态。他指出，拖延者虽受困于对即时快乐的盲目追求，但内心拥有“恐慌怪兽”这一内在机制，可在面临截止日期或重大风险时激活，驱使个体采取行动。厄班通过TED演讲准备过程的自述，阐述了从拖延至行动转变的内在动力，强调理解拖延症本质与应对策略的重要性。\n\n此外，文章进一步探讨了拖延症的心理机制，即由理性决策者、即时满足猴和恐慌怪兽构成的系统，虽不完美却能促使拖延者在关键时刻完成任务。然而，拖延症存在两种主要类型：有截止日期的拖延，恐慌怪兽能在关键时刻介入，减轻拖延影响；无期限的拖延，涉及个人成长、健康及人际关系等长期目标，由于缺乏外在压力，恐慌怪兽难以发挥作用，导致拖延影响持续累积，对生活造成深远的负面影响。许多人在追求自我驱动目标或处理个人事务时，因缺乏有效内在或外在激励而深陷拖延泥潭，亟需寻找克服之道。",

        "new_src_summary": "In a reflective and lighthearted narrative, Tim Urban, author of Wait But Why, delves into the psychology of procrastination using anthropomorphic analogies and personal anecdotes, creating an engaging and accessible discussion on the topic within the behavioral science domain. Urban humorously contrasts the straightforward objectives of a dog's life with the complex challenges faced by humans due to our ability to envision the future and make long-term plans, thanks to the \"Rational Decision-Maker.\" He shares his struggles with procrastination, such as completing a 90-page thesis in 72 frantic hours, while introducing the whimsical Instant Gratification Monkey, a character symbolizing the short-term pleasure-seeking nature of procrastinators. This Monkey often diverts attention from crucial tasks, leading to distractions and unproductive activities in the \"Dark Playground,\" a metaphorical area where leisure activities occur at inopportune times, evoking feelings of guilt, dread, anxiety, and self-loathing.\n\nUrban elaborates on the procrastinator's decision-making process through the roles of three personified entities: the Monkey, the Rational Decision-Maker, and the Panic Monster. The Panic Monster, akin to a guardian angel, awakens as deadlines approach or significant consequences loom, instilling fear in the Monkey and permitting the Rational Decision-Maker to reclaim control. Urban uses a personal story about preparing for a TED conference to illustrate how the Monkey can be sidetracked by trivial pursuits until the Panic Monster compels it to withdraw, allowing the Rational Decision-Maker to assume command and commence preparations for vital tasks.\n\nUrban's narrative-driven, self-help and motivational writing style blends humor with insightful commentary on the psychology of procrastination, providing a creative viewpoint on conquering the habit. He emphasizes the roles of the three personified entities in the procrastination process and the conditions that lead to productive action. After publishing his thoughts on this topic on a blog, Urban received countless responses from individuals globally, expressing frustration over how procrastination adversely affected their lives. He differentiates between two procrastination types: one with deadlines (addressable by the Panic Monster) and another without, impacting long-term goals and personal well-being. In scenarios lacking external pressures, the Panic Monster fails to inspire, resulting in ongoing procrastination.\n\nThe paragraph also highlights the issue of long-term procrastination, which is less visible and less discussed than short-term deadline-based procrastination. Long-term procrastination can cause significant unhappiness and regret, making individuals feel like spectators in their own lives. The author believes that everyone procrastinates on something in life, and even those who appear to have a healthy relationship with deadlines are not immune to the Instant Gratification Monkey's tricks when deadlines are absent. The author encourages readers to take a hard look at their life calendars, consisting of only 90 years or so, and to start addressing their procrastination today.\n\nThe informal, anecdotal, and explanatory style, combined with a tone that is both slightly humorous and seriously reflective, makes Urban's discussion on procrastination relatable and insightful. The focus remains on the behavioral science domain, highlighting the complexity of human decision-making processes and the struggle to overcome procrastination's negative effects. Urban's narrative underscores the importance of recognizing and addressing both short-term and long-term procrastination, urging readers to take action and avoid feeling like mere spectators in their own lives.",
        "new_tgt_summary": "合并后的摘要：蒂姆·厄班，一位前政府学专业的重度拖延症患者，通过亲身经历紧急赶制90页高年级论文的过程，深入探索了拖延症的现象，并在博客“等等，为什么”中以幽默的方式剖析了拖延者内心的复杂动态。他揭示了即时满足寻求者“猴子”与理性决策者之间的矛盾，以及拖延者常常陷入“黑暗游乐场”的焦虑状态。厄班指出，虽然拖延者受困于对即时快乐的盲目追求，但他们内心拥有“恐慌怪兽”这一内在机制，在面临截止日期或重大风险时被激活，从而驱使个体采取行动。通过TED演讲准备过程的自述，厄班阐述了从拖延到行动转变的内在动力，强调理解拖延症本质与应对策略的重要性。\n\n文章进一步探讨了拖延症的心理机制，即由理性决策者、即时满足猴和恐慌怪兽构成的系统，尽管不完美，但能在关键时刻促使拖延者完成任务。然而，拖延症存在两种主要类型：有截止日期的拖延，恐慌怪兽能在关键时刻介入，减轻拖延影响；无期限的拖延，涉及个人成长、健康及人际关系等长期目标，由于缺乏外在压力，恐慌怪兽难以发挥作用，导致拖延影响持续累积，对生活造成深远的负面影响。许多人在追求自我驱动目标或处理个人事务时，因缺乏有效内在或外在激励而深陷拖延泥潭，亟需寻找克服之道。长期拖延症比短期基于截止日期的拖延更为隐蔽且讨论较少，它可能导致长期的不幸和遗憾。这种拖延让人感觉像生活中的旁观者，问题在于未能开始追求梦想而非无法实现它们。作者认为每个人都有拖延倾向，需要意识到生活中的时间有限，用“生命日历”来表示90年生命的每一周，提醒人们警惕即时满足的诱惑，因为实际上剩下的时间并不多，应该立即开始行动，避免未来的后悔和遗憾。",
