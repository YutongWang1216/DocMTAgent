I'd like to ask for a show of hands, is there anyone who has ever unfriended someone on Facebook? The reason being that person made some unpleasant remarks about politics, religion, child-rearing, or food.
Is there anyone who has at least one person they don't want to talk to and are avoiding?
Once, in order to converse politely, one only had to follow the words of Professor Higgins from "My Fair Lady" and talk about the weather or health.
These days, with topics like climate change and anti-vaccination, they've ceased to be safe conversation topics.
In the world we live in, any conversation runs the risk of escalating into a dispute, where politicians can't even talk to each other, and there are people who get passionately for or against even the most trivial issues, which is not normal.
A survey by the Pew Research Center of ten thousand American adults revealed that people are now more polarized and at odds with each other than at any time in history.
Everyone refuses to compromise and won't listen.
And we are deciding where to live, whom to marry, and who to be friends with based on what we already believe.
This is also about not having ears to listen.
Conversation requires a balance of talking and listening, but somewhere along the way, we've lost that balance.
The development of technology is also a contributing factor.
The mobile phone is likely still in your hand or within reach.
According to the Pew Research Center, one third of teenagers are sending over a hundred messages per day.
It's likely that for most of these people, messaging is more frequent than face-to-face conversation.
In the magazine 'The Atlantic',
There is an interesting article written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell.
He gave his students a communication assignment.
He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific topic without using notes.
He writes, "I realizedâ€”"
"The ability to converse is the most overlooked skill that teachers fail to teach."
Students spend hours each day engaging with ideas and others through screens, yet they have few opportunities to hone their interpersonal skills.
It may sound strange, but we must ask ourselves if there is anything more important among the skills required in the 21st century than the ability to converse coherently and confidently.
I make my living by talking, whether it's with Nobel laureates, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, or plumbers.
I talk to people I like and those I don't like as well.
Personally, I also talk to people with whom I completely disagree.
And yet, I can still have wonderful conversations with these people.
In the next ten minutes, I will teach you how to speak and how to listen.
You've probably heard various tips about conversation - looking into the other person's eyes, thinking in advance about topics of interest, showing that you're listening attentively by maintaining eye contact, nodding, and smiling, or repeating and summarizing what the other person has said -
Please forget all of that.
Because it won't help.
There is no need to learn how to appear as if you are listening attentively if you are actually doing so.
(I use the skills I have as a professional interviewer in my everyday life as well.)
I will teach you the techniques of interviewing, which will also help you to improve your conversational skills. Learn how to engage in conversation without wasting each other's time, without being boring, and without hurting each other.
Everyone has had wonderful conversations at some point.
Do you know what it is like?
It's a conversation where you feel truly connected to the person you've engaged with, feeling encouraged and drawn into the discussion, and at the end, you sense that you've been completely understood by the other party.
There is no reason why most conversations couldn't be like that.
Let's look at ten basic rules of conversation together; mastering even one of them will enable you to enjoy better conversations.
Rule one: "Do not multitask."
It's not just about putting down the cell phones, tablets, and car keys.
It means being present both in body and mind.
You make sure to be there in that moment.
Don't think about things like arguments with your boss.
Don't think about things like what to have for dinner.
If you want to withdraw from the conversation, please do so, but don't half-participate.
Rule number two: "Do not talk unilaterally."
If you want to assert your opinion without any responses, discussions, counterarguments, or opportunities for growth, then you might as well write a blog.
The reason I don't invite people who talk dictatorially on my show is because it's boring.
If you are conservative, you may dislike Obama, food stamps, and abortion.
If you are liberal, you probably dislike big banks, oil companies, and Dick Cheney.
You know exactly what they are going to say.
It's not like it can't happen that way.
We need to approach conversations with the attitude that there is always something to learn.
The famous therapist M. Scott Peck says, "To truly listen, you need to put yourself aside."
This means that there are times when you need to set aside your own opinion.
"By feeling accepted, the speaker becomes less guarded and is inclined to reveal deeper parts of themselves to the listener."
Let me repeat, approach it with a learning attitude.
According to Bill Nye, "Everyone you meet knows something you don't."
I would say this: "Everyone is an expert at something."
Rule three: "Ask open-ended questions."
Let's take a cue from journalists.
Ask questions that start with when/where/who/what/why/how
Even if you ask complex questions, you'll only get simple answers in return.
If you ask "Were you scared?"
React to the most striking word in the question, in this case "scared," and the answer will be a simple "yes" or "no."
"If you ask 'Were you angry?' the response would be 'Yes, I was very angry.'"
Let the other person do the explaining, since they are the one who knows.
You ask questions like this: "What was it like?"
"If you ask 'How did you feel?'"
If you do, the other person will be forced to pause and think, and you'll likely receive much more interesting responses.
The fourth rule is "go with the flow."
You must not hold back any thoughts that come to mind.
You've probably heard interviews where, after the guest has spoken for several minutes, the interviewer asks a question that is completely unrelated or something that the guest has already answered.
The interviewer probably stopped listening two minutes earlier, having thought of a clever question and deciding in their heart that they absolutely had to ask it.
We are doing exactly the same thing.
When sitting down to talk with someone, I recall a time when I bumped into actor Hugh Jackman at a cafe.
And they stop listening.
Thoughts and ideas come to mind, but
Just let them come and go without holding on to them.
Rule 5: "If you don't know, say that you don't know."
People who appear on the radio, especially on NPR, knowing that everything they say is recorded, are particularly careful when they claim to be experts on something or assert that they know something for sure.
Everyone should do the same; it's better to be overly cautious.
You must not cheapen the conversation.
Rule number six: "You must not equate the other person's experience with your own."
It means not bringing up your own story about losing a family member when the other person is talking about losing their family.
It means not starting to complain about how much you hate your job when the other person is talking about a problem they're having at work.
The experiences of the other person and yourself are completely different.
All experiences are individual.
What's even more important is that you're not there to talk about yourself.
There's no need to try to show how wonderful you are or how much you're struggling during that time.
When asked about his IQ, Stephen Hawking is said to have responded, "Well, I don't know. Boasting about your IQ is a bit of a loser's game."
Conversation is not an opportunity to promote oneself [21st century conversation]
"When asked 'How are you today?' don't respond with 'Check out my blog!' Rule number seven: Don't repeat the same thing multiple times."
It can be annoying and seem pushy, but it's something everyone tends to do.
Especially in workplace conversations or when talking with children, people tend to rephrase and repeat themselves in an attempt to demonstrate that their argument is correct.
Please refrain from doing that.
Rule 8: "Don't sweat the small stuff."
Frankly speaking, the other party is not concerned about the minutiae - things like era names, surnames, or dates. You may all be struggling to recall these details, but
The other party is not interested. What they are interested in is you.
what kind of person you are and what commonalities exist.
So, let's forget the details; they are unnecessary.
Rule number nine, which is not the last but the most important thing.
"Listening"
While I don't know how many great minds have emphasized this point, listening is the most crucial skill that anyone can cultivate.
As paraphrased from Buddha's words, "You learn nothing when your mouth is open."
As per the famously taciturn President Calvin Coolidge, "No one was ever hurt by keeping his mouth shut."
Why don't we try to listen to each other?
One reason is that people would rather speak than listen.
When speaking, you have the control.
There is no need to ask about things you're not interested in.
Become the center of attention
You can strengthen your own identity.
However, there is another reason; it is because we get distracted.
The average person speaks at a rate of 225 words per minute, yet we are capable of processing up to 500 words per minute.
Our consciousness attempts to fill that surplus of 275 words.
It does indeed require effort and energy to keep our attention on the other person, but if we fail to do so, it doesn't qualify as having a conversation.
It's merely two people in the same place yelling unrelated words at each other.
We must listen to each other.
The writer Stephen Covey expresses it beautifully.
Many people listen not to understand, but
but to reply.
There is one more rule, number ten is "be brief".
[As my sister would say, "A good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to hold interest, yet long enough to cover the essentials."] (Applause) All that I've said so far can be summed up in one thing: "Be interested in others."
I was raised in the household of a very famous grandfather, and it was a given at our home that certain things were just the way they were.
Various people would come to talk to my grandparents, and after the guests had left, my mother would come and ask, "Do you know who that person was?"
She became a Miss America finalist.
That person became the mayor of Sacramento.
She is a Pulitzer Prize winner. He is a Russian ballet dancer.
I've come to believe that everyone has some hidden amazing quality.
I have come to believe that this is what makes me a good host.
I hope to be surprised by keeping my mouth shut as much as possible and opening my heart, and I have never been disappointed by doing so.
Please do the same thing yourselves.
Go out and talk to people, lend them your ears, and above all, expect to be surprised.
Thank you for your kind attention.
