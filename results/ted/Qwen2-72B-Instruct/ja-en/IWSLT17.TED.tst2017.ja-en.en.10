Hello
My name is Matthew Williams, I am the champion.
I have won medals in three different sports at Canada's national championships. In basketball, I've had the honor of participating in world-level competitions, proudly representing Canada at the World Championships.
(Applause) I train five days a week in basketball and speed skating, and I'm supported by top-tier coaches and mental performance consultants who help me bring out my best in competitions.
By the way, this is all about the Special Olympics.
Would hearing that change your perspective on me and my accomplishments?
The world doesn't always recognize people like me as champions.
Until recently, people like me were marginalized and not meant to be seen in public.
Since the Special Olympics began in 1968, things have changed significantly, but all too often, people with intellectual disabilities remain invisible to the wider world.
Not everyone thinks it's wrong to use discriminatory terms right in front of me.
They use the term "intellectually disabled" in a derogatory way.
They don't consider how much it hurts me and my friends.
Don't think that I'm here as an object of pity.
I am here because there are still serious issues with how the world views people with intellectual disabilities, indeed, because in far too many cases, they fail to see us at all.
Did you know that the World Championships took place this year?
I was one of the 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities, where competitors from 165 countries gathered in LA to compete against each other.
More than 62,000 spectators were watching the opening ceremony, which was being broadcast live by sports networks TSN and ESPN.
You probably didn't know about such a big event, did you?
What do you think when you see someone like me?
It's a challenge to all of you, can you see us as equals?
The Special Olympics transforms not only the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities but also shifts the values of everyone who watches.
For those who may not know, the Special Olympics is targeted at athletes with intellectual disabilities.
It is distinct from the Paralympics and the Olympics.
High-level sporting events are held throughout the year for individuals with intellectual disabilities, changing the lives and values of those involved.
This changed my life, and it changed the lives of many, many other people as well.
And the world's view of individuals with intellectual disabilities has also changed.
I was born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability.
I played hockey from when I was little until I was 12 years old.
As I grew up, it became increasingly difficult to keep up with everyone else, which was frustrating and made me angry.
For a while, I completely stayed away from sports. I didn't have many friends either, and feeling left behind made me sad.
In the past, people with intellectual disabilities were hidden from society.
No one ever thought that we could participate in sports, let alone be considered valuable members of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, studied the impact of regular exercise on the motor skills of children with intellectual disabilities.
The conclusion reached by Dr. Hayden and other researchers through rigorous scientific methods was this: "The low motor skills in children with intellectual disabilities are simply due to a lack of opportunities to participate in physical activity."
For individuals with intellectual disabilities, participating in sports programs and athletic competitions can be beneficial.
Few believed it at the time, but the pioneers—Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of the Special Olympics—never gave up. And the athletes have proven them right over four million times and counting.
Before participating in the Special Olympics, I was nervous. Being young, shy, lacking confidence, and having few friends contributed to my apprehension.
But when I went, everyone encouraged and supported me, and there, I could be myself without worrying about what others thought.
I am now a basketball and speed skating athlete, having participated in state and national competitions. This year, I made it to the Summer World Games held in LA, marking the first time I advanced to the World Championships representing Canada—as a member of the basketball team.
I am one of over 4.5 million athletes worldwide, and I've heard many stories just like this.
By being athletes of the Special Olympics, we reclaim our pride and dignity.
The Special Olympics also addresses important health needs for its athletes.
According to research, the average lifespan of men with intellectual disabilities is 13 years shorter than those without, and for women, it is 20 years shorter.
However, by staying active and participating in competitions through the Special Olympics, we can maintain our health.
Additionally, the coaching staff teaches us about nutrition and health.
The Special Olympics provides free health screenings, targeting athletes who may have had difficulty communicating with doctors or accessing medical care.
At the 2015 Summer World Games, my team Canada faced off against the basketball team from Nigeria.
The day before the game, the Nigerian team underwent health screenings conducted at the venue, and seven out of ten members received free hearing aids, allowing them to hear clearly for the first time in their lives.
The athletes have experienced remarkable changes.
They were able to enjoy the game more vividly and play with confidence, because they could communicate with their coach in spoken language for the first time.
Their emotions were also heightened, now that they could hear the sound of the ball, along with the whistle and the cheers of the fans standing in the stands. These were sounds that everyone else took for granted.
The Special Olympics athletes not only during the competitions,
Their lives also change outside of the arena.
According to a survey conducted this year, nearly half of American adults do not know anyone with an intellectual disability. These individuals, comprising 44% of Americans, reportedly have very low levels of acceptance towards people with disabilities and hold significantly negative views.
Furthermore, the frequent use of derogatory terms is evidence that individuals with intellectual disabilities remain invisible to far too many people.
People use them casually, as if they were ordinary expressions or terms of mockery.
The term "mental retardation" was tweeted over nine million times last year, yet it is a deeply hurtful term for me and the over 4.5 million athlete peers around the world.
People may not think they are being insulting, but they are mistaken.
My fellow Global Messenger, John Franklin Stevens, wrote an open letter to a political commentator who used that derogatory term, inviting him to "come to the Special Olympics one day."
"See if you can leave without being moved."
(In applause) At this year's 2015 Summer World Championships, people waited in line for hours to watch the final day of the weightlifting competition.
In a packed arena, my teammate Jackie Barrett, known as "the great moose of Newfoundland," lifted 297 kg in the deadlift and 277 kg in the squat—(applause)—shattering the previous records at the Special Olympics.
Jackie is a record holder for weightlifting in Newfoundland, not just within the Special Olympics, but among all weightlifters.
In LA, he became a big star, with ESPN tweeting his new record live, truly moved by Jackie's performance.
Fifty years ago, almost no one thought that people with intellectual disabilities could do such things.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the iconic LA Memorial Coliseum to witness the opening ceremony of the World Championships and to cheer on the athletes who had gathered from 165 countries around the world.
We were far from being invisible; we basked in cheers and were celebrated.
The Special Olympics teaches athletes to have confidence and pride.
It teaches society that individuals with intellectual disabilities are worthy of respect and acceptance.
(Applause) Today, I have achievements and dreams in sports, I am fortunate to have great coaches, I carry respect and dignity, I am healthier than before, and I am aspiring to become a personal trainer.
(Applause) I am no longer hidden or someone to be bullied; I am here giving a TED Talk.
Thanks to the Special Olympics, the world has changed, but there's still a long way to go.
If you happen to meet a person with an intellectual disability next time, I hope you will recognize their abilities.
If you come across someone using derogatory terms, I hope you will inform them of how truly hurtful their words can be.
And I hope you'll consider getting involved with the Special Olympics.
(Applause) Let me leave you with just one final thought.
Nelson Mandela said, "Sport has the power to change the world."
The Special Olympics is truly changing the world, giving 4.5 million athletes a chance to transform, to gain confidence, to make friends, to avoid being seen through the lens of prejudice, to feel like champions, and to actually become champions.
Thank you.
