This is a story about how we acquire knowledge.
The protagonist of the story is this woman, Natalia Ripinskaya.
She is a paleontologist who specializes in excavating ancient remains.
Natalia Ripinskaya: People used to call me the "Doctor of Dead Things."
Latif Nasser: What I found particularly intriguing was that the excavation site was way up north in the Arctic Circle, in the remote tundra region of Canada.
One day in the summer of 2006, she was at an excavation site called Files' Leaf Bed, which is less than ten degrees latitude from the magnetic North Pole.
Natalia: You might think it's boring, just walking around all day carrying a backpack, clutching a GPS and a notebook, picking up anything that looks like a fossil.
Latif: One time, she noticed something.
Natalia: It was an old, reddish-brown, palm-sized thing.
It was lying on the ground.
Latif: At first, I thought it was just a piece of wood, because at Files' Leaf Bed, fragments of ancient plants are often found.
However, when we returned to the camp that night -
Natalia: When I took out my magnifying glass and looked more closely, there were no growth rings.
Perhaps due to its state of preservation, the more you look at it, the more it seems -
It was a bone.
Latif: Over the course of more than four years, she returned to this site many times and eventually collected thirty pieces of the same bone, most of which were very small.
Natalia: There weren't many, just enough to fit in a small plastic bag.
Latif: I tried to put the pieces together like a puzzle, but
It was really a tough job.
Natalia: Since it was shattered into pieces, I tried to use sand and putty, but it didn't work out well.
So, in the end, we ended up using a 3D scanner.
Latif: Amazing, huh? Natalia: Right?
Latif: It's much easier to work on it on the screen.
Natalia: When everything finally came together, it was quite moving.
Latif: How confident were you that you were putting it together correctly?
What if it turned out to be something different if assembled another way? What if it actually turned out to be a parrot?
Natalia: No, there was no mistake.
Latif: What she had discovered was a shinbone, specifically one from a cloven-hoofed animal, the kind that includes cows and sheep.
But this bone was not supposed to be from cows or sheep.
It was too large.
Natalia: It was jumbo-sized, from a really huge animal.
Latif: What kind of animal could it have been?
Stumped, she showed one of the bone fragments to a colleague in Colorado, and that's when inspiration struck.
Natalia: When we made incisions on the end of the bone with a saw, it had a distinctive smell.
Latif: It smelled like burnt meat.
It was the same smell Natalia detected when she sectioned the skull in the eerie dissection room - the smell of collagen.
Collagen serves to maintain the structure of bones.
Over time, it typically decomposes, but
In this case, the Arctic Circle's climate acted as a natural refrigerator, preserving it.
A couple of years later, when Natalia attended a conference in Bristol, her academic colleague Mike Buckley was demonstrating a new process called "collagen fingerprinting."
Each animal has a slightly different collagen structure, and if we can determine the characteristics of the collagen in the unknown bone, we may be able to compare it to those of known animals, possibly leading to its identification.
That's why I sent one of the bone fragments via courier.
Natalia: Because it was important, I wanted to track it.
Latif: He processed the bone fragment and compared it with 37 species of modern mammals.
We found a matching animal.
The owner of the three-and-a-half-million-year-old bone that Natalia unearthed in the high latitudes of the Arctic Circle turned out to be, incredibly,
it was a camel.
Natalia: "I thought 'what?' If true, it's amazing."
Latif: We examined many bone fragments, but all yielded the same result.
However, considering the size of the bones we found, this camel was a third larger than those we see today.
The height at the shoulder would have been roughly 2.7 meters—with a body weight of about one ton.
"That's right."
What Natalia had discovered was a "giant Arctic camel."
When you hear the word 'camel', what comes to mind is probably the Bactrian camel native to East and Central Asia.
The postcard image in your mind is surely of this dromedary camel. When you think of desert creatures, this is it—the animal that dwells in hot deserts such as the Middle East and the Sahara, storing water for long desert journeys in its large hump, and advancing by treading on sand dunes with its broad, large feet.
How on earth did such an animal make it to the Arctic Circle in northern Canada?
In fact, there was something that scientists had known all along, even before Natalia's discovery - that the camel's place of origin is actually America.
It originated here.
It's been about 45 million years since camels first appeared, and for nearly 40 million of those years, they were found exclusively in North America, with around 20 species, possibly even more.
Latif: Did you notice any differences when you laid them all out?
Natalia: Yes, the sizes varied quite a bit.
There were also types with very long necks, perhaps similar to those of giraffes.
Latif: There were also ones with faces like crocodiles.
Natalia: The early, primitive camels were very small, about the size of rabbits.
Latif: Huh? Rabbit-sized camels?
Natalia: It's an early type.
You wouldn't understand even if you saw it, would you?
Latif: I'd like to raise rabbit-camels.
Natalia: Yeah, it's probably the best.
Latif: Afterwards, between 3 to 7 million years ago, herds of camels moved south to South America where they evolved into llamas and alpacas. Other types crossed the Bering Land Bridge into Asia and Africa.
At the end of the last ice age, the camels in North America became extinct.
While this much has already been established, it doesn't fully explain how such a discovery could be made so far north.
For instance, in terms of temperature, it's the complete opposite of the Sahara Desert.
Indeed, the temperatures 3.5 million years ago were, on average, 22 degrees higher than they are today.
So, it might have been covered in coniferous forests, resembling the current Yukon River basin and Siberia.
Still, winter would have lasted for six months, and ponds would have frozen solid.
There were also blizzards.
There would have been times when darkness lasted for 24 hours.
Well then, overall
How did this superstar of the Sahara survive in the Arctic Circle climate?
Natalia and her fellow scientists believe they have found the answer.
And it's a remarkable answer.
What if the characteristics of camels, which we have thought evolved to adapt to places like the Sahara Desert, actually evolved to survive the winter?
What if the broad feet, instead of being for walking on sand, were actually like snowshoes for traversing snow?
What if the hump on the back, which I was surprised to learn is filled not with water but with fat, actually helped them survive the half-year winters with scarce food?
What if, after crossing the land bridge and for some time thereafter, features adapted for winter survival were utilized in the context of a hot desert environment?
For instance, the hump might have been useful even in a hot climate, as storing all the body's fat in one place like a backpack could eliminate the need to be covered entirely in insulating fat.
This would make it easier to dissipate heat.
This extraordinary notion suggests that what was considered definitive evidence of adaptation to the desert could actually serve as proof that they once inhabited high latitude regions within the Arctic Circle.
I am not the first to tell this story.
Others have used this story to recount the wonders of evolutionary biology and to provide clues for understanding future climate change.
But the reason why I like this story is different.
For me, this is a story about ourselves, about our worldview and how it changes.
I have been trained as a historian.
What has become clear is that scientists, for the most part, are also historians.
They also seek to understand the past.
I will speak about the history of the universe, the planets, and life on Earth.
And as a historian, I begin by considering the progression of the narrative.
Natalia: We create stories and we cling to them, for instance, the story of the desert camel.
It's a beautifully crafted story; the camel is perfectly adapted.
They've been living in the desert all along.
Latif: But someday, perhaps we might find a small piece of evidence.
Understanding something small may lead to rebuilding everything you once believed.
In this case as well, a small fossil, akin to a piece of wood discovered by a single scientist, has led science to a hypothesis about why this animal, resembling something out of a Dr. Seuss book, looks the way it does - an entirely new theory that defies conventional wisdom.
My perspective on camels has been completely transformed.
The perception shifted from seeing camels as highly specialized creatures suited only for specific desert environments, to recognizing them as animals that happen to be in the Sahara but are truly cosmopolitan, capable of surviving anywhere in the world.
(Applause) This is Azurie.
Hello Azurie, hi.
Here, have a bite
Azurie usually performs at the Radio City Music Hall.
This is no joke.
Well, this Azurie is living proof that our narrative about the world is dynamic.
We must reconstruct and reimagine our narratives.
Right? Azurie
A new perspective on the world exists on the other side of a single bone fragment.
Thank you.
