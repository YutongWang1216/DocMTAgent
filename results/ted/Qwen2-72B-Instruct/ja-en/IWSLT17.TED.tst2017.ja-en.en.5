Food Crisis
It has been in the news on a daily basis
What could it mean?
In various parts of the world, there are places experiencing food shortages and others with food supply surpluses.
On the other hand, GMOs are saving the world.
There may also be issues with GMOs.
Excessive agricultural runoff is polluting the seas, introducing toxins, and reducing nutrient levels.
Such things continue unabated.
I am quite disheartened by today's discussions concerning the environment.
How can we work towards a solution utilizing our knowledge?
Let's look at the apple food crisis.
You all must have eaten at least one apple last week.
Do you have any idea how long it has been since that apple was picked?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months - that's the average for apples on the shelves of American grocery stores.
I don't think there would be much difference in Europe or in other countries around the world.
We pick the apples, store them in refrigerators, and fill them with preservative gases. There are records of workers dying when they entered these storage areas to retrieve apples, because the air that slows down the decay of apples is toxic to humans.
Why didn't anyone know about this?
Why didn't I know about this?
90% of the antioxidant components contained in apples are lost by the time they are eaten.
It's nothing more than a lump of sugar at this point.
Why have we become so woefully uninformed? What can be done to improve this situation?
It is because there is a lack of platform.
When I talk about platforms, I mean computer platforms; in my youth, I did some really risky things online.
I did it on this platform.
However, I was also able to meet people and express myself.
What ways are there to express yourself using food?
If there is a platform, one can freely pose questions beginning with "What if..."
My question was this: What if the climate were equal for everyone?
This is a map of the world's climate.
Areas with high productivity are shown in green, and those with low productivity are shown in red.
The colors shift and change; what was once the heart of agriculture in California has now moved to Mexico.
China is growing better food on Brazil's land, and we are at the mercy of the climate.
What if each country had a climate suitable for production?
How will it change people's lives?
Will it change the quality of life and nutrition?
The problem for previous generations was to acquire more food - at a lower cost.
Welcome to the world of the global farm.
Humanity has constructed massive analog farms.
The lines depicted here illustrate the food transportation connected by cars, planes, and railways.
It is miraculous that the food to sustain a population of seven billion is produced by a mere fraction of the people.
What if...
What if we could build a digital farm?
It is a digital farm that spans the globe.
What if we could take this apple, digitize it in some way, transmit it as particles through the air, and then reconstruct it in another place?
What if...
I read the text written here, was inspired, and that's what prompted me to start this research.
The first point - there is no future for Japanese agriculture in terms of young labor force, water, or land. Upon realizing this, I headed to Minamisoma, just north of Fukushima, which had been affected by the earthquake at that time.
Because the land was contaminated, the children moved away to places like Sendai and Tokyo. Japan is already dependent on imports for as much as 70% of its food.
The food issue is not limited to Japan.
The population involved in agriculture in America is 2%.
No matter the country, there are limits to what can be done with as few as 2% of the population involved in agriculture.
When you look at other countries - 50% of Africa's population is under 18 years old.
80% of them do not want to become farmers.
Agriculture is hard work because of its nature.
The lives of small-scale farmers are miserable.
They flow towards the urban areas.
In India—where farmers aren't even receiving supplies of water and electricity—the number of farmers who committed suicide this year was the highest in the past decade.
It's a truly unpleasant story.
Where do the farmers go?
In urban areas
Young people don't stay in their hometowns; they all flow into the urban areas.
Then, how can we build a platform that inspires young people?
Introducing the new type of tractor!
This is the combine harvester that I have produced.
Years ago, I went to stationery stores and DIY shops and started crafting.
I began creating odd things, attempting to make plants dance by connecting them to a computer, only to find that they all withered away in great numbers. It was quite distressing.
I finally managed to create something that wouldn't wither.
In my life, I have built one of the most intimate relationships by beginning to understand the language of plants.
When you wish for them to grow larger
They said, "Go for it!"
All that exists here is an old electrical laboratory that nobody wants to enter.
"What do you think can be done?"
Together with my colleagues, we built a farm at the MIT Media Lab, a place that has been known as a research institute for digital life rather than biology.
In this space of approximately six square meters, we produced enough food to feed three hundred people per month, though it may not be considered substantial...
There are many interesting technologies being employed there, however,
What is perhaps most intriguing among them?
Beautiful white roots, deep green vegetables, and a monthly harvest
Could this be a new type of cafeteria?
A new retail experience?
A new type of grocery store?
One thing I can say for sure is that this is the first instance of picking something from a root at the Media Lab.
There is a salad in the bag, but there are no problems.
But what would happen if there were image processing experts, data scientists, and robotics researchers who, while picking something from a root, thought, "If I use my knowledge, I could do something like this; let's give it a try"?
We decided to keep the plants here in the lab before taking them outside, because we don't want to throw away what we've grown; it's precious.
My palate has changed—I want to taste test it myself first, I don't want to feed it to others until I'm sure it's a decent food.
So, I am eating lettuce every day, and I can tell the pH of the lettuce with an error of no more than 0.1.
"It's like saying 'Ah, that's pH 6.1, I can't eat it today.'"
The lettuce of the day was incredibly sweet.
The plants become very sweet because, when they are stressed and try to protect themselves, chemical reactions occur inside them, akin to them saying, "I don't want to die."
Such cries from the plants transform into a sweet taste that is to my liking.
Scientists and technologists who have turned to plant physiology...
I thought about how to make this experiment replicable by others.
I am very interested in what will be created. So, I considered designing a lab that can be delivered anywhere.
I decided to give it a try and created it.
My lab is located on the front side of the Media Lab, with around thirty sensors attached to each plant.
If you are familiar with genomics and genetic engineering, this is what is known as a phenotype.
It originates from the word "phenomenon."
Saying something like "I prefer strawberries from Mexico" actually means you prefer strawberries that have been grown under a climate that cultivates a taste to your liking.
So, by creating that climate through programming - concocting combinations like concentrations of carbon dioxide and oxygen as recipes - we program elements such as the flavor, nutrients, size, shape, color, and texture of the plants.
This requires data, so I attach many sensors to understand the circumstances. Thinking about indoor horticulture, when you look at this, you will likely become quite sad, wondering 'Why is it dying? Just talk to me.'
Farmers develop the most incredible knack for predicting plant growth in their late sixties to seventies.
When plants are wilting, they can tell the reasons, whether it's a lack of nitrogen, a calcium deficiency, or that they need more moisture.
This incredible knack is not inherited.
This is data saved in the cloud by a certain farmer.
Tracking the temporal changes in the data
We take the correlation between these data and each individual plant.
These are the broccoli in the laboratory on a certain day represented by IP addresses.
It is broccoli assignable with an IP address.
If you still feel it's not weird enough, click here to see the plant's profile.
This is downloadable data concerning the growth of the aforementioned plants, likely exceeding your expectations, addressing not only when they will be ready to eat but also
the times when the nutrients one requires can be obtained,
it predicts until the timing when it reaches your preferred taste.
Have I overwatered it?
Have I let in too much sunlight?
It also issues warnings.
It talks to me. It's intelligent. It has a common language with me.
Sometimes I think of myself as the first user of the Facebook of the plant world.
What you saw earlier was the plant's profile, and then the plant starts making friends.
plants that consume less nitrogen, more phosphorus, and less potassium than others.
They should be compatible. So far, we can only speculate, also learning about the complexity of plant-to-plant relationships.
Plants may not recognize us as friends yet - but the possibility exists; it's up to our actions.
This is my current lab.
It's slightly more orderly than before. I have experience setting up data centers in various hospitals, and I do have some knowledge about creating controlled environments.
Since then, I have been attempting all sorts of experiments in this environment.
This method, aeroponics, was developed by NASA to reduce the amount of water needed and to transport it to the Mir space station for space missions.
Here, we are providing just the right amount of what plants need - water, minerals, and oxygen.
Root growth is straightforward; it thrives beautifully with just the provision of what it needs.
It seems as though plants have two hearts.
Because they have two hearts, they grow four to five times faster.
It is a complete world.
Throughout history, humanity has advanced technology to obtain seeds that can grow even in harsh environments, and while technological reforms continue, we have now birthed new methods. It is a complete world.
We have cultivated various types of plants.
This type of tomato has not been commercially produced for 150 years.
Are you aware that humanity possesses rare and ancient seed banks?
It's about the seed storage.
It's wonderful.
There are also varieties that have been preserved alive, which no one has ever tasted.
I am the only one who has eaten this tomato in the lab.
The issue is that this is a sauce tomato, and I don't know how to cook it. I tried eating the sauce tomato, but it wasn't tasty.
Using proteins, we have tried growing various things.
Humans might be able to do it too - but in reality, we're not doing it.
What has become clear is that the equipment is large-scale and extremely costly.
We thought about spreading it worldwide, but it ended up being an apparatus costing around ten million yen.
It's hard to find someone who can casually come up with ten million yen, so I thought about making something smaller.
This project was actually taken forward by one of my students, Camille, an undergraduate studying mechanical engineering.
Camille, myself, and our friends spent the entire summer repeatedly experimenting, aiming to create something that was more affordable, functioned better, and could be made by anyone.
Next, we brought this to junior high and high schools.
If you want to feel humbled, try teaching something to a child.
I went to the school and said, "Set the humidity to 65%."
A first-year junior high student asks, "What is humidity?"
I replied, "It's about the water in the air."
He retorts, "There's no water in the air, you fool."
I also respond, "You don't have to believe me.
You don't have to believe
"Try setting it to 100%."
He sets it to 100%—now, what happens?
Moisture coalesces into mist, and finally, drops of water begin to fall.
He says, "So, humidity is about rain, huh?
"Why didn't you tell me that before?"
We created an input screen that's like a game.
It's a 3D display, accessible from anywhere in the world, log in is possible from a smartphone or tablet.
You can operate various devices and sensors of the bot.
You can choose recipes made by other children around the world if you like.
Once a recipe is selected and initiated, seedlings can be planted.
Changes can also be given during the growth period.
"Why do plants need CO2? Isn't it harmful? It can kill people, can't it?"
Such words are also heard.
If the CO2 concentration is increased, the plants will die.
If the CO2 concentration is reduced, the plants become very vigorous.
Once the plants are harvested, a new digital recipe is completed.
It is a process of iterative design, development, and exploration.
You can download data about the new plants they've developed and new digital recipes, and the changes are - were they effective or counterproductive?
Consider these to be the core part of the development process.
We will likely learn a lot.
This is what we call the Food Computer, a three-week program in schools.
It will grow this much in just three weeks.
More importantly, this child may have thought for the first time that they could become a farmer, or perhaps even that they want to be a farmer.
There we made all the data completely open.
Let's assemble the Food Computer at home, everything is online.
It might be a bit difficult, but—
It's just getting started, but everything is in place.
The ease of accessibility is a very important matter.
We will make it more accessible.
They are farmers, electricians, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, plant scientists, economists, and urban planners.
On one platform, they will do what they are good at.
In this lab, we have become cramped.
This is the new facility I've just started using.
Such warehouses should be available anywhere.
That's the reason it was chosen.
I am trying to create something like this within the warehouse.
This already exists in reality.
Please take a look.
This also already exists.
Each is growing green vegetables and the Ebola vaccine.
One reason these plants won in the DARPA Grand Challenge is because they were ahead in Ebola research, which is wonderful.
This plant produces proteins that are resistant to Ebola.
From pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements to lettuce.
Although it bears no resemblance to lettuce, this is precisely the field I'm researching.
They differ in every aspect.
We're still in the initial chaos phase— it's like saying 'This is our black box—' 'Buy mine.'
"It's no good; I hold very valuable intellectual property."
"His won't work, buy mine."
In reality, it's just getting started, and it's where society is trying to change.
While seeking more affordable food, there is also a growing demand for higher quality, environmentally friendly products.
The fact that McDonald's revealed the questionable contents of their Chicken McNuggets at any time indicates that they are adapting their marketing to the changing times.
Let's take a look at the modern world.
Personal Food Computers, Food Servers, and Food Data Centers operate using an open phenotype model.
Unlike an open genome, ours is more like a wiki with a touch of climate recipe added; you can select from a pull-down menu, initiate it, and grow accordingly.
How would this effort appear on a global scale?
Do you remember when the world was connected by lines?
First, set up the oscillator.
Instead of sending the food itself, we will begin to transmit information about food.
It's not just my fantasy; it's already being spread in such places.
With the advent of Food Computers, Food Servers, and Food Data Centers, people are becoming connected through the sharing of information.
Future food supply is not about fighting the inherent flaws.
We know what the flaws are.
Future food supply is about connecting the next billion farmers through a network, enabling the presentation and provision of solutions via a platform, "What if..."
Thank you.
