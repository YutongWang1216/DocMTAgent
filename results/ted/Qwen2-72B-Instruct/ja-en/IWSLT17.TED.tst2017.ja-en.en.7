I have been yearning for the sea since I was a child.
It is a wonderful place teeming with color and life, and it is the dwelling of strange creatures akin to aliens.
I would imagine the large sharks dominating the food chain, or picture the graceful sea turtles swimming across the coral reefs.
Because I transitioned from being a marine biologist to a photographer, I have dedicated much of my work to searching for enchanted places like those I dreamed of when I was little.
As you can see, I have been exploring underwater since I was quite young.
But the first time I really dove underwater was when I was around 10 years old.
I still vividly remember how hard I swam; I was trying to touch an old cannon on top of the shallow coral.
And finally, when I got a hold of it and looked up, I was instantly surrounded by a myriad of colorful fish. That was the day I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Peschak, conservation photographer, having lived on this planet for forty years, I've been given the precious opportunity to explore the wonders of the ocean for National Geographic and the Save Our Seas Foundation.
I have photographed everything, from massive sharks to tiny, adorable creatures that fit in the palm of my hand.
I encountered a stinky-breathed humpback whale feeding just 30 centimeters away in the frigid waters off the coast of Canada's Great Bear Rainforest.
I have also been present at the mating grounds of the green sea turtles in the Mozambique Channel.
All people and the sea on Earth have been influencing each other.
And the pristine seas like those I dreamed of as a child are becoming increasingly difficult to find.
They are being steadily pushed to the limit and threatened.
As humans, we have continuously been the dominant hunters on Earth, and I have witnessed and photographed the expanding impact of this firsthand.
For a long time, I believed that by shocking people with dramatic images, I could capture their attention.
While there are advantages to this approach, I have come back to basics.
I came to believe that the most powerful way to effect change is by appealing to people's emotions.
As a sort of matchmaker, as a photographer, I've had the invaluable opportunity to reveal the full extent of the animals and ecosystems hidden beneath the ocean's surface.
If we don't know something exists, we can't cherish it or protect it.
It is the power of conservation photography to reveal the hidden that truly matters.
Although I've visited hundreds of marine environments, there are a few that have particularly left a deep impression on me.
The first time I experienced such excitement was ten years ago, off the rocky, unspoiled coastline of South Africa.
Every year in June and July, vast schools of sardines migrate northward in a grand movement known as the Sardine Run.
There is a proper reason for this.
It's because hungry, swift predators are secretly pursuing them with incredible intensity.
Generally, dolphins hunt in groups, separating some sardines from the school to create what is known as a bait ball, a spherical aggregation of fish.
They drive the fish to the surface of the sea and thus gain access to this living feast.
There is a shark right behind them.
Many people believe that dolphins and sharks are natural enemies, but during the Sardine Run, they actually coexist.
Dolphins assist sharks in feeding more efficiently.
Without dolphins, the bait ball would be more scattered, and sharks would get stuck in what's called the sardine donut, taking in a mouthful of water and gaining nothing.
Well, I have experienced thrilling moments with sharks during the Sardine Run, and I know that they do not see me as prey.
Yet, in this wild feast, I do get bumped and slapped by fins just like any other fish.
Moving eastward from the coast of Africa across the vast Indian Ocean, you arrive at the Maldives, a collection of islands made of coral.
During the intense southwest monsoon, manta rays come from all around the atolls to a tiny spot in the Baa Atoll called Hanifaru. The main diet of the manta rays is usually tiny crustaceans, smaller than the pupil of a human eye.
When there are patches in the plankton's distribution, the manta ray feeds alone, repeatedly doing backflips in the water, much like a puppy chasing its own tail.
However, when plankton concentrates in one area, the rays line up in a row, forming a long chain for feeding. Even if the ray near the front misses a bit of plankton, the ray that follows is sure to scoop it up.
As the amount of plankton increases, the rays swim closer to each other, and this distinctive behavior is known as a cyclone feeding.
The rays, maneuvering in a tight formation, transform into multiple layers of cylindrical shapes, creating whirlpools to gather plankton which they then suck into their cavernous mouths.
Diving amidst a congregation of hundreds of rays is truly an unforgettable experience.
When I first filmed at Hanifaru, it was unprotected and under threat from development.
Working alongside NGOs like the Manta Trust, my photographs eventually helped in the process of designating Hanifaru as a marine protected area.
The local island fishermen used to hunt rays for their skin, which is used to make traditional drums.
Currently, they are among the most avid conservationists, and thanks to the rays, the Maldives now earns an additional eight million dollars annually.
I have always wanted to go back in time to an era where maps were largely blank or marked with "Here be dragons."
The closest I've come to experiencing seas from such a time was in the atolls on the western side of the Indian Ocean.
Diving far from shipping lanes and fishing fleets into such seas, the condition of the oceans as they once were can be felt intensely.
Most people have probably never heard of the small coral reef called Bassas da India in the Mozambique Channel.
The coral reef acts as a barrier, and the lagoon within has become a nursery for Galapagos sharks.
This shark cannot be called timid, even in broad daylight.
I had a hunch that they might become bolder and come out in greater numbers when night fell.
Have you ever encountered so many sharks at a single coral outcrop before?
By capturing and sharing moments like these, I am reminded of why I chose this path.
I have already done work for 'National Geographic' this year on the Baja California Peninsula.
About halfway down the Pacific side of the peninsula lies San Ignacio Lagoon, an important breeding ground for gray whales.
This coastline is where a massacre took place for a century, with over 20,000 gray whales killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
Now, the descendants of those whales gently push their own calves up to the water's surface to play, and they even interact with us.
This species has truly made an astonishing comeback.
On the opposite side of the peninsula lies a quiet fishing village called Cabo Pulmo.
It was on the brink of collapse after decades of rampant overfishing.
In 1995, the local fishermen advocated for their seas to be designated as a marine protected area.
What followed can only be described as a miracle.
Despite it being only 10 years since protection began in 2005, the fish populations had achieved an unprecedented recovery.
But see for yourself, let's go together.
Let's take a breath and dive deep into the heart of the largest and densest schools of fish I've encountered.
Everyone can generate hope.
Through my photographs, I want to convey that it's not too late to save our oceans.
I particularly want to highlight nature's resilience when faced with the challenge of feeding 7.3 billion people.
My aspiration is that in the future, one would have to look much harder to take such photos, and to continue capturing images that serve as examples of coexistence with the ocean.
I can only hope that it becomes a regular occurrence.
To survive and progress in my profession, I must be an incurable optimist.
I always work under the assumption that great photographs, the kind that drive change, might just be around the next corner, or beyond that patch of coral, within that lagoon, or just one more dive away.
