My hometown is the most free, tolerant, and progressive place in the entire United States - Seattle, Washington.
I grew up in a wonderful family of Seattleites.
My mother was an artist and my father was a university professor; I am very grateful for the environment in which I was raised, because I have always been able to live my life as I see fit without any reservations.
In fact, I did not follow the path that my parents had envisioned for me.
I dropped out of college at the age of 19 - whether it was a dropout or an expulsion doesn't really matter, does it?
And I began touring around as a professional horn player, which was something I had always dreamed of doing.
While playing chamber music, I traveled all over the United States and Europe, and for several years, I was paired with the excellent jazz guitarist, Charlie Byrd.
And by the end of my twenties, I became a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a wonderful life it has been.
My parents never once complained.
They have always supported me.
It wasn't what they had in mind, though.
He apparently told neighbors and friends, "My son is on his gap year - about ten years long."
But there was one awkward conversation about my lifestyle, so let's talk about that.
I was 27, home from Barcelona for the holidays, back in my childhood home, cooking in the kitchen with my mother, just the two of us.
My mother had become uncharacteristically quiet — too quiet —
I thought something was off.
When I asked, "Mom, what are you thinking about?"
My mother said, "We've been really worried about you."
"What does that mean?" I wondered what she could be talking about now.
"You must tell me honestly— you haven't been voting for the Republicans, have you?"
Well, the truth was, I was just a horn player who wasn't particularly interested in politics.
I had something of an awakening, which my parents picked up on, and it left them somewhat bewildered.
I had become a fervent supporter of capitalism, and I will explain how that came to be.
It stems from a long-standing interest of mine, which might come as a surprise: "poverty."
I remember seeing real poverty for the first time during my childhood in Seattle.
My family was lower middle class, but of course, we were far from true poverty.
it was a world away.
The first time I saw what poverty looked like, it was in the early 70s; I was six or seven years old.
It was a common experience, nothing special, the kind that everyone goes through.
It was a photograph in National Geographic, of a child around my age in East Africa, with flies swarming on their face and their belly bloated.
It was clear that there was no saving them, but there was nothing I could do about it.
Some people might remember a similar photo, not necessarily the same one.
It is a photograph that revealed the face of poverty, which continues to plague the world, to the Western countries.
That image was seared into my mind, persisting through my growth, schooling, dropping out and re-enrolling, and even starting a family; it never faded away.
I became concerned about what had become of that child.
I wondered what had become of people like that child all around the world.
I began to investigate, not being in university at the time, but seeking answers. I wanted to know what had happened to those at the very depths of poverty around the world.
Whether it worsened or improved, just what happened?
And upon finding the answer, my life changed, which I will also share with all of you.
Now, most Americans think that poverty has gotten worse. They believe it has deteriorated compared to when they were children, at the time of that photograph.
If you ask Americans whether global poverty has worsened or improved, 70% would likely respond that hunger has worsened since the early 1970s.
Let me now tell you the truth.
The enlightenment that altered my worldview was this:
Between 1970 and today, the proportion of people living in starvation conditions - those subsisting on less than a dollar a day - adjusted naturally for inflation, has decreased by 80%.
Compared to when I was a child, the world's worst poverty has decreased by 80%.
I had no idea about such a thing.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a miracle.
There is cause for celebration.
As a measure against poverty, it is the greatest achievement in human history, and it happened in our lifetime.
When I learned this, a question arose: How was this achieved?
If we don't understand why it worked, we can't replicate it, can we?
If we want to replicate this success and lift another two billion people out of poverty - which is the main point here - just like the two billion of our brothers and sisters, who were once considered the "least of these" in biblical terms, have done since my childhood until now, escaping from poverty.
I want to know in order to save another two billion people.
So I started looking for the answer.
The answer had nothing to do with politics; it didn't matter to me.
I still have no interest.
I wanted the best answers from mainstream economists, regardless of whether they were right, left, or centrist.
Let me tell you that answer.
There are five reasons for success.
It is the lifting of two billion of our brothers and sisters worldwide out of poverty that has been achieved so far.
The first is globalization.
The second is free trade.
The third is property rights.
The fourth is the rule of law.
The fifth is entrepreneurship.
Since the 1970s, the world has increasingly embraced free enterprise systems, making such progress possible.
I, too, am not so simple.
I understand that free enterprise is not perfect, and I also recognize that there are other necessities beyond free enterprise to build a better world.
But it's amazing, you know.
It's an issue that transcends politics.
What I have learned and realized is
The significance of capitalism does not end with the accumulation of wealth.
The best aspect of capitalism is that it's driven by purpose. Many people on this stage will talk about purpose, the kind that springs from aspiration, which is deeply intertwined with the free enterprise system.
We must spread this purpose more widely.
Now, let's talk about the second epiphany, which is related to the first and promises to bring progress not just to the world, but also to this very town where we are now.
Of all the things I've heard people say, the most concise and accurate encapsulation of my thoughts on poverty alleviation, which I mentioned earlier, is this: "No system in human history has created wealth like the free market."
"It has lifted billions out of poverty."
Whose words might these be?
It has the ring of someone like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
"It is different"
It is President Barack Obama.
Why can I say it off the top of my head?
Because I was told directly.
You probably won't believe it.
What came out of my mouth was "Banzai!"
In addition, I thought, "What a wonderful opportunity."
Do you know what I was thinking?
In May 2015, during an event centered around this theme, it was at Georgetown University.
I believed this to be the solution to America's greatest challenge, but what was it?
Regardless of whether one is liberal or conservative, it's about reaching out to those who need us most under the notion that the free market can solve poverty.
You don't have to tell me that crises popping up everywhere, in the United States and around the world, are due to the polarization of politics.
We have now reached a critical, precarious situation.
It's an unpleasant situation; this must not stand.
Last year, a paper was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the most prestigious scientific journal published in the West, the most authoritative scientific academic journal published in the West.
In a 2014 paper, the theme was "Asymmetric Political Motivation."
What this amounts to, according to the definition of psychologists, is assuming that one's own ideology stems from love, whereas an adversary's worldview originates from hate.
It is often the case in the world's conflicts.
It is a phenomenon observed between Palestinians and Israelis, for instance.
What the authors of this paper found is that in today's United States, both Republicans and Democrats are falling into the trap of what they call "asymmetric political motivation," where the majority of people assume their own political motivations are noble, while attributing negative intentions to those who disagree with them.
Today in the United States, the majority of politically passionate people believe that they are driven by love, while their opponents are motivated by hate.
Please give it some thought.
Most people think like this: "My ideology is based on fundamental decency, I want to help people, but the others are villains trying to bring me down."
As long as there is such asymmetry, we cannot move forward as a society.
It's impossible.
What then, is the solution?
Let's start by being honest; differences are to be expected.
Let's not underestimate the differences; it's not that simple.
There is a great deal of excellent research on this topic.
Veteran TED speaker and friend, Jonathan Haidt,
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
They are studying the differences in people's ideologies, values, and moral perspectives.
According to him, for instance, conservatives and liberals differ considerably in what they prioritize.
For instance, according to Haidt, among liberals, those who are deeply concerned about poverty outnumber those who prioritize economic freedom by 59%.
Among conservatives, those who prioritize economic freedom outnumber those who are deeply concerned about poverty by 28%.
This gap doesn't seem to be narrowing, does it?
Incompatible to the point of no return? That's a mistake.
This is what diversity is about, and here lies our strength.
Do you remember what lifted the poor out of poverty?
It was the fixation on poverty that took on the form of free enterprise and spread across the world.
In other words, we need each other if we are to lift the next two billion people out of poverty and help those in need.
There is no other way.
Well then,
How can we achieve this?
It's tough, isn't it?
Innovative thinking is needed.
There are many on this stage.
Social entrepreneurship—that's it, absolutely right, isn't it the best?
We need sustainable, ethical, moral, and responsible foreign investment—
Exactly right! But what is truly needed?
It is a new world with a flexible ideology.
More unpredictability is needed.
Isn't it?
Have you ever felt that your ideology has become too set in its ways?
Feels a bit cliché, doesn't it?
Do you ever think that you're only listening to people who share your opinions?
Why is this dangerous?
Because when you talk about the economy in this country, there are conservatives on the right who only talk about taxes, regulations, and big government.
On the left, there are liberals who, when discussing the economy, always focus on income inequality.
Both are important matters, indeed crucial to both you and me.
When it comes to the story of rescuing people, who are suffering from hunger and in need of help, from poverty today, this gets in the way.
We should collaborate under the best means available to us, utilizing the highest level tools at our disposal, to alleviate poverty. This becomes possible only when conservatives recognize the need for liberals and their dedication to addressing poverty, and when liberals acknowledge the necessity of conservatives and their commitment to free markets.
If embraced, this diversity will become one of America's strengths moving forward.
So, how can we collectively make this a reality?
I need a list of action items, not just for all of you, but for myself as well.
Remember, it's not enough to merely tolerate those with differing opinions; that's number one, the first item.
That's simply not enough.
We must bear in mind the necessity of people who disagree with us, for there are still those waiting for the tools our diversity can provide.
So, what should we do? How should we communicate this?
Where do we start? Right here.
It's all of us in this room. We are the fortunate ones.
We are fortunate to have people who lend us their ears.
We are also fortunate in success and leadership.
They might even listen if we speak about ideologies that they would never have expected.
Progress may begin from there.
That's the first one. Now for the second.
There is a kind of person I hope you become, and that I aspire to be myself, particularly someone who can blur the lines, who is difficult to pin down and doesn't fit neatly into any category.
If conservative, to the conservatives who speak of a moral duty to fight for the poor, constantly talking about poverty.
If liberal, to the liberals who constantly talk about the virtues of the free market when used responsibly to solve our problems.
If we do that, two things will be achieved.
The first is the ability to tackle the relief of the next two billion people, engaging ourselves in the solutions needed going forward, much like we have seen numerous times in the past.
The second is transforming the terribly sacred ideological battles we experience under this country into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
If we do, perhaps we might realize that the major differences we perceive may not be as large as we think they are after all.
Thank you.
