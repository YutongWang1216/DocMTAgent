Have you ever heard of place names such as Kenema in Sierra Leone or Arua in Nigeria?
That place is the most exotic location for me.
In the hospital located there, nurses, doctors, and scientists have quietly been fighting one of humanity's most terrifying enemies for years, the Lassa virus.
The Lassa virus is very similar to the Ebola virus.
It causes high fevers and sometimes claims lives.
Yet, by protecting the people of the community there every day, even while putting their own lives at risk, they are safeguarding all of us.
Yet, what surprised me most when I visited there years ago was that they start each grueling day on the front lines singing every morning.
Everyone gathers to express their joy.
They show their vitality.
Over the years, by visiting each other and gathering together to sing and create songs, it's truly enjoyable. We're not just there for the pursuit of science; we're connected through humanity.
I think you can imagine how it becomes indispensable, increasingly important as circumstances change.
In March 2014, things changed dramatically when a major Ebola outbreak was announced in Guinea.
This was in West Africa, near the borders of Sierra Leone and Liberia, where the first outbreak occurred in West Africa.
We were afraid -
In fact, for a while, Lassa and Ebola may have been spreading more than we thought, and I wondered if they might eventually reach Kenema.
So my team members sprang into action, joining Dr. Fumar Kahn's team, where they set up a highly sensitive virus RNA detection device, preparing to detect if Ebola crossed the border and reached Sierra Leone.
Since we had already been using such equipment for measures against the Lassa virus, the method was known and the team was very competent.
All they needed was for us to provide them with the tools and space to test for Ebola.
But unfortunately, that day has come.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to the hospital's maternity ward, and when the team conducted tests for viral RNA, they confirmed the first case of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Sierra Leone.
Their work was truly commendable.
They immediately diagnosed this case, handled the patient safely, and initiated contact tracing investigations to get a handle on the situation.
Perhaps this could have allowed for the containment of the infection's spread at an early stage.
However, by that time, the outbreak had already been ongoing for several months.
Hundreds of cases emerged, surpassing previous outbreaks.
When it arrived in Sierra Leone, it was not just another case, but it came like a tsunami.
We mobilized in response to this infectious disease, collaborating with international communities, the Ministry of Health, and the Kenema authorities. Cases escalated to 31 the next week, then 92, and subsequently 147—all patients were streaming into Kenema, due to the limited facilities available in Sierra Leone capable of handling this disease.
We worked around the clock, doing everything we could to save the patients, to raise awareness, and we also did one simple thing.
The blood samples we had taken to test for Ebola could, of course, have been disposed of properly.
Instead, we inactivated the virus with chemicals, packed the blood samples into boxes, and shipped them across the sea to other research facilities.
We sent them to Boston where my team is located.
We then worked around the clock, rotating shifts daily, and swiftly sequenced ninety-nine genomes of the Ebola virus.
The genome is the blueprint of the virus.
A genome is something that everyone has.
It represents all the characteristics that make up who we are and contains vast amounts of information.
The outcome of such work is simple yet immensely powerful.
By observing and comparing these 99 viruses, and contrasting them with the three genomes previously announced in Guinea, we were able to determine that the outbreak had begun in Guinea months earlier. First, it infected humans, and then it spread through human-to-human transmission.
This is crucial for understanding how best to intervene, but then what follows is equally important: contact tracing.
We confirmed that the virus was mutating as it spread among humans.
Observing each of these mutations is critically important, because diagnostic equipment, vaccines, treatments—all are fundamentally based on genomic sequences.
Experts in global health must now mobilize a response and recalibrate all previous efforts to address this.
At that time, as a scientist, my work entailed accumulating data at hand, secluding myself in the lab for months on end, meticulously analyzing the data with great care, and going through several rounds of revisions to prepare research papers. Finally, upon publication of the paper, I would make the data publicly available.
This is the current state of the flow of scientists' research.
But we couldn't afford to do things that way, could we?
With friends on the front lines, what was abundantly clear was that help was needed, and moreover, a great deal of help was required.
Therefore, the first thing we did after the genomic sequences were read was to immediately publish them on the website.
We simply broadcasted the data to the world and said, "Please lend us your support."
And help came.
Almost instantly, people from all over the world who were surprised to see the data published, reached out to us.
One of the world's foremost virus tracking teams suddenly became part of our team.
We began collaborating virtually, with ongoing exchanges over the phone and email, tracking the virus minute by minute and brainstorming ways to halt the spread of infection.
There are various ways to build a community in times of crisis.
In particular, when the outbreak began to spread on a global scale, everyone became actively involved, investigating, engaging, and offering their support.
Everyone wanted to be involved.
The capabilities of such people around the world are truly remarkable, and the internet connects all of us.
Imagine this: instead of seeing each other as threats and keeping our distance, everyone says, "Let's do this."
They say, "Let's work together to solve this."
The issue was that the data we all used was severely limited and inadequate, consisting only of what could be found through internet searches.
During such times, a multitude of possibilities and opportunities are lost.
During the early stages of the epidemic in Kenema, 106 medical records had accumulated, which we decided to make public to the entire world.
And at our research institute, we were able to demonstrate that by training a computer on those 106 cases, it could predict the prognosis of Ebola patients with near 100% accuracy, a tool we then provided to the healthcare workers on the ground.
We created an app to provide this tool, but to prove its effectiveness, we needed to demonstrate that the app was fully functional.
The 106 records were far from enough, and we were waiting for more data to come in before releasing it.
But the data was not coming in as we had hoped.
Everyone was engaged in their own research and contemplation, waiting, but everyone was siloed, not utilizing the power of collaboration.
But come on, this just can't be happening.
Don't you think so? I'm sure you all feel the same way.
Our lives are at stake here.
In reality, many lives were lost, including those of healthcare workers, my dear colleagues: five in number - Val Fornie, Alex Mogboi, Dr. Fumar Kahn, Alice Koboma, and Mohammed Fullah.
They were among the many healthcare workers who lost their lives in Kenema and its surroundings, five out of many. At a time when the world was watching, we were working in silence and separately.
Ebola hemorrhagic fever, like other threats to humanity, is exacerbated by suspicion, backstabbing, and discord.
When we build walls between us and engage in conflict, the virus gains strength.
Unlike other natural threats, the fight against Ebola involves all of us equally.
We are all in this fight together.
If one person contracts Ebola, it may soon be transmitted to someone else.
In this situation, where our lives are equally fragile, endowed with the same vitality, and filled with the same fears and hopes, I wish we could cooperate with joy.
One of the graduate students I mentored read a book about Sierra Leone and learned that the word "Kenema," the name of the city where our hospital is located, actually comes from the Mende language of Sierra Leone, meaning "clear as a river, transparent to everyone's eyes."
We felt a deep resonance with this, as even before knowing its meaning, we had always respected the people of Kenema, striving to work together and share information in an open environment.
It is indeed a matter of great importance.
When the outbreak occurred, it was required of us to share information openly with each other and with those around us in order to fight it together.
This is by no means the first, nor will it be the last, Ebola epidemic; there remain many more microbes lurking, such as the Lassa virus.
And when the next pandemic strikes, it could happen in a major city where millions reside.
It might be a virus that can be transmitted through the air.
The virus might possibly be spread deliberately.
This is truly terrifying, isn't it? Yet, what our experience has taught us is that we possess both the technology and the capacity to overcome it; we have the ability to triumph over viral infections and gain the upper hand.
But it becomes possible within the bounds of our united strength, so let's do it with joy.
In the battle against infectious diseases, those like Dr. Kahn who lost their lives, along with others who fell at the frontlines, have always been fighting alongside us. Let's continue this fight together, just as they did.
Let's illuminate the world with billions of warm hearts and acts of kindness, so that it will not be at the mercy of destruction caused by a single virus.
Thank you.
