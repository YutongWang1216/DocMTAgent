There are times when I feel a deep sense of shame for being European.
In the past year, over a million people have arrived in Europe seeking help, and frankly, our response has been shameful.
It's just riddled with contradictions at this point.
We all mourned the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi, but since then, over 200 children have drowned in the Mediterranean one after another.
Despite recognizing the need for shared responsibility in accepting refugees under international agreements, we tacitly accept the fact that the number of refugees taken in by the small country of Lebanon exceeds the total across all of Europe.
While we lament the existence of smuggling boats, we have made them the only route to asylum in Europe.
Despite a labor shortage, we are excluding people whose skills match our economic and demographic needs from being accepted.
While we claim to uphold liberalism against Islamic fundamentalism, we are doing so with repressive policies that detain young asylum seekers, separate children from their families, and confiscate refugees' belongings.
Don't you think that's strange?
Why have we become so inhumane in our response to this humanitarian crisis?
I don't think it's because people are indifferent. At least, I don't want to believe that's the reason.
I believe it's due to a lack of vision among politicians; a vision to adapt international refugee policies, established over 50 years ago, to the changing era of globalization.
I would like to return to the basics and pose two very fundamental questions that we all should consider.
First, why isn't the current system working?
And, how can we fix this?
The modern refugee system is something they created in the immediate aftermath of World War II.
The original purpose was to provide people with a destination when states collapse, or, in the worst case, turn their swords against their own citizens, and to offer them a place where they can live with safety and dignity until they can return home.
It was designed to address situations like what we see in Syria today.
It is an international agreement signed among the governments of 147 countries - through treaties such as the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and via international organizations like the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, they have pledged to mutually accept refugees into their own territories; it is about the acceptance of people fleeing from conflicts and persecution.
But today, this system is not functioning.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In reality, our immigration policies are blocking the path to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek integration into their place of refuge, with the expectation that they may one day return home.
In reality, it ends up in a virtually permanent state of limbo.
In theory, refugees are meant to be shared in a spirit of global responsibility.
In reality, it is the countries adjacent to conflict zones, due to geographical proximity, that end up shouldering the overwhelming majority of the world's refugees.
The reason the system is not functioning is not because the rules are wrong,
It is because we are failing to properly apply the rules in accordance with a changing world, and it is this that we need to rethink.
Here, what exactly is the mechanism of the current refugee system?
Let me explain a little.
However, I will explain from the perspective of the refugees, not from the top-down viewpoint of the system.
First, please imagine a Syrian woman.
Let's call her Amira.
She is a woman who symbolizes many people from her region.
Amira, like a quarter of the world's refugees, is a woman with children. The reason she cannot return home is that the city she lived in is in the state you see – Amira's city, Homs, was once a beautiful and historic place, but now it is buried in rubble.
It is not a situation where they can return.
However, resettlement in a third country is not an option for Amira, as it is akin to winning the lottery, a possibility that materializes for only one percent of the world's refugees.
As a result, Amira and her family are forced into almost impossible choices.
There are only three basic options available.
The first is to enter a refugee camp with her family.
There, they may receive aid, but prospects for Amira and her family's future are virtually non-existent.
Refugee camps are barren wastelands - often in the middle of deserts.
In Jordan's Zaatari refugee camp, the sound of gunfire can be heard at night from the border with Syria.
There are constraints on economic activity.
The quality of education is also poor.
And around 80% of refugees worldwide who are housed in camps will endure such conditions for a minimum of five years.
Life there is miserable, and perhaps for that reason, only 9% of Syrians actually choose this route.
The second option is to head for urban centers, such as Amman or Beirut, in neighboring countries.
This is the option chosen by 75% of Syrian refugees.
But there too, they face significant challenges.
Refugees typically do not have the right to work in these urban areas.
They are also unable to receive much assistance.
In this case, after exhausting their savings, Amira and her family are left with virtually nothing, facing a life of poverty in the city.
The third option — the number of Syrians choosing this is increasing.
This is the phenomenon seen in Europe today, where, for the sake of their families, people are embarking on extremely perilous journeys in search of a glimmer of hope, risking their lives to head for foreign lands.
The world presents these virtually impossible choices to refugees, limiting their options to three: camp confinement, a life of poverty in the city, or embarking on a perilous journey.
For refugees, this is precisely what the international refugee system itself has become.
But thinking that this is the only option is an illusion.
I believe there is room for reconsideration.
The reason we confine them to these options is because, in our minds, we think the paths available to refugees are limited to these alone, but that is incorrect.
Politicians view the refugee issue as a "zero-sum" problem - that is, they believe that anything done for refugees comes at the expense of their own citizens.
We tend to share the assumption that refugees are a burden and a weight on society, as if it's a common truth.
There are also ways in which refugees can contribute to society.
What I am saying is that there are ways to expand the options for refugees while ensuring that everyone benefits - the host countries and communities, our societies, and the refugees themselves.
I believe that by considering four approaches I will discuss, we can fundamentally change our thinking about refugees.
One common thread among all four is the approach of utilizing opportunities created by globalization, mobility, and markets, which can transform our perspective on the refugee issue.
The first idea is about creating environments suitable for refugees, starting from a very basic understanding: that refugees are just like everyone else, simply placed in extraordinary circumstances.
I began research with a colleague from Oxford University in Uganda, looking into the economic activities of refugees.
I didn't choose Uganda because it is a leading recipient country in the world.
Because it has an excellent policy in place.
Unlike other recipient countries around the world, Uganda provided economic opportunities to refugees.
It granted refugees the right to work and the freedom of movement.
This has yielded remarkable results for both the refugees and the regions where they reside.
In the capital, Kampala, 21% of refugees own businesses and employ workers, with 40% of those employed being citizens of the host country.
In other words, refugees were creating jobs and employing citizens of the host country.
Even within refugee camps, we saw impressive examples of vibrant individual enterprises.
For instance, in the Nakivale refugee settlement, Congolese refugees are involved in a business trading digital music.
A venture started by a Rwandan refugee involved providing computer games, repurposed from gaming consoles and televisions, for teenagers.
Despite the harsh conditions, innovative initiatives are being undertaken. This photo features Demoukay, a Congolese individual,
When I arrived at the settlement, I was virtually penniless but aspiring to be a video producer.
He, along with friends and colleagues, established a community radio station and, borrowing a video camera, is now engaged in video production.
He has co-produced two documentary films at the request of my team and is successfully running his business with a minimal initial investment.
We should let such examples guide our response to refugees.
Instead of inevitably seeing refugees as dependent on humanitarian aid, we need to provide them with opportunities to prosper as human beings.
Of course, clothing, bedding, shelter, and food are all crucial in an emergency, but we need to look beyond these immediate needs.
Opportunities such as access to communication, electricity, education, the right to work, and access to capital and banks.
We must ensure that benefiting from the world economy is something that is not only commonplace for us but also possible and rightful for refugees.
The second is an idea concerning economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all of the world's refugee-hosting countries have adopted a policy like Uganda's.
Most countries do not welcome refugees into their economies in the same manner as Uganda.
However, practical solutions that can be adopted do exist.
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, the development economist Paul Collier. During our stay, we engaged in brainstorming sessions and held discussions with the international community and the Jordanian government, seeking ways that align with Jordan's national development strategy.
We came up with a way to provide jobs for Syrians, an idea involving economic zones where the employment of refugees could be integrated with that of the host country's citizens, the Jordanians.
Just 15 minutes away from the Zaatari refugee camp, home to 83,000 refugees, lies the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area, an economic zone.
The Jordanian government has invested over a million dollars to connect this area to the power grid and road network, but two things are missing: labor and domestic investment.
What if refugees could work here? What if, instead of being confined to the camp, they could support their families and acquire skills through vocational training before returning to Syria?
We believed this would be beneficial for Jordan, because as a middle-income country, Jordan's development strategy required the expansion of its domestic manufacturing sector.
Not only would it be beneficial for the refugees, but it would also contribute to the post-conflict reconstruction of Syria, nurturing the best human resources to eventually rebuild Syria—a recognition that the protection and development of refugees is essential.
When we published this proposal in the political journal 'Foreign Affairs',
It caught the attention of King Abdullah.
At a Syria support conference held in London two weeks ago, it was announced that there would be a pilot implementation this summer.
The third idea I'd like to propose to you all is a matching system between countries and refugees, one that leads to delightful outcomes such as the one depicted in this photo, where a Syrian refugee is taking a selfie with Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Asking refugees about their hopes and where they want to go doesn't happen very often, does it? Yet, it is possible for everyone to benefit while listening to the voices of the refugees.
The concept of matching theory, developed by economist Alvin Roth, involves determining the final combinations based on the preferences of the parties involved.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Titelboim explored how to apply this concept to refugees, asking them to list their preferred destinations in order of choice, while simultaneously having host countries prioritize the type of refugees they prefer based on criteria such as job skills and language, then matching the two parties accordingly.
Now, of course, the criteria for acceptance should also take into account factors such as diversity and vulnerability, but these too can be considered ways to increase the matching rate.
The concept of matching is effectively utilized in various scenarios, such as university admissions for students and the pairing of kidney donors with patients, and it even plays a role in algorithms used on dating websites.
Why not incorporate this to expand the options for refugees?
It can also be applied at the national level. One of the major challenges we face is gaining the acceptance of refugee settlements from local communities.
Currently, for instance, in my country, the UK, we often do the ridiculous thing of sending engineers to the countryside and farmers to the city.
By conducting market matching, we can align the preferences of both parties, and listen to the needs and desires of both the residents of the host communities and the refugees.
And the fourth idea is humanitarian visas.
Almost all of the tragedies and chaos unfolding in Europe are entirely avoidable.
It is due to the fundamental contradiction in Europe's refugee regulations. What this means is that to become an asylum seeker in Europe, one must arrive having undertaken the aforementioned perilous journey without prior preparation. But why is such a journey necessary?
In an era with budget airlines and robust consular services, such journeys should be utterly unnecessary; yet, last year, over 3,000 people died undertaking them, at Europe's borders and within Europe itself.
Simply put, if refugees were allowed to travel to Europe regularly and become asylum seekers, these tragedies could be avoided. The way to make this happen is through something called humanitarian visas, which can be obtained from embassies and consulates in neighboring countries. Then, simply by paying their own fare, refugees could travel to Europe by ferry or plane.
Using smugglers to cross from Turkey to the Greek islands costs 1,000 euros.
A budget airline ticket from Bodrum to Frankfurt costs 200 euros.
There are significant advantages to unlocking such options for refugees.
Many lives would be spared, the refugee smuggling industry would dry up, and chaos would be removed from the front lines of Europe, such as the Greek islands.
What is obstructing such measures is not a lack of sensible strategies, but policy.
This idea is actually being implemented.
Brazil has pioneered this approach, admitting more than 2,000 Syrians who obtained humanitarian visas to enter the country and gained refugee status upon arrival.
All the Syrians who utilized this system have attained refugee status and have been officially recognized as refugees.
There are also historical precedents.
Between 1922 and 1942, the Nansen passport was used as an international identity document, enabling 450,000 Assyrians, Turks, and Chechens to move within Europe and apply for refugee status in other European countries.
The Nansen International Office for Refugees was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, recognizing the practicality and effectiveness of this strategy.
All four of the ideas I've discussed would increase the options for hypothetical refugee Amira, mentioned at the beginning.
This expands the range of options for refugees, meaning they aren't limited to the three unreasonable choices I initially mentioned, and it benefits everyone else as well.
In conclusion, we desperately need a new vision - one that recognizes that expanding refugees' options does not have to be a burden.
The notion that refugees inevitably become a burden is mistaken.
While they carry a humanitarian burden, refugees are people with skills, talents, and ambition, and if given the opportunity, they have the ability to contribute to society.
In the years to come, there will be no shortage of people migrating around the world.
What is happening in Europe will continue for many years to come.
Refugees will continue to move, wandering in search of a place to belong. To address this situation, we should seek rational and realistic methods - not those based on outdated theories of humanitarian assistance or notions of charity, but rather approaches that harness opportunities created by globalization, market dynamics, and mobility.
I want to appeal to all of you, and especially to the politicians among you, to wake up and confront this challenge directly.
Thank you.
