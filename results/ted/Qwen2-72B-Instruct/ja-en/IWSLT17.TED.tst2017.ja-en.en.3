In college, because I majored in politics, I had to write a lot of reports.
When a regular student writes a report, the workload would likely be distributed like this.
If you do it this way - although it starts slowly, by making good progress in the first week, even if the load increases a bit in the second half, an orderly state is maintained.
I would want to do it that way too.
In terms of the schedule
I intend to start right away, but when it actually comes to doing the report, in my case, it ends up like this.
It always ends up like this every time.
I ended up having to write a 90-page thesis, which should be written over the course of a year.
I knew that my usual approach wouldn't work.
It's too large in scale.
I decided to make a plan and proceed with it in this manner.
It's a one-year plan.
It feels like a gentle staircase, starting lightly, rising a bit in the middle, and then sprinting at the end.
Climbing up this staircase is
It shouldn't be that difficult.
However, something strange happened.
The first few months were
I had passed by many times, but I accomplished nothing.
Therefore, the plan will be changed like this.
Then - the middle period also passed by, but I was unable to write, resulting in this situation.
Further, two months became one month, and that further shrunk to two weeks.
One morning, I woke up to find that there were only three days left until the deadline. Not having written a single word yet, I had no choice but to write a 90-page paper in 72 hours, pulling all-nighters for two consecutive nights. While the human body isn't designed to endure such stress, I sprinted across campus with all my might, time seemingly turning into slow motion, and submitted it at the very last moment before the deadline.
I thought that was the end of it all.
A week later, I received a call from the university.
"Is this Mr. Tim Urban?"
"Yes"
"I have something to discuss regarding the submitted paper."
"Sigh"
What I was told was, "I have never seen such an excellent graduation thesis."
Such a thing did not happen.
It was a truly terrible paper.
I just wanted everyone to think, even if just for a moment, "Isn't this person a genius?"
It is a truly terrible paper.
The current me is a writer.
I write a blog called "Wait But Why".
About two years ago, I decided to write about 'procrastination'.
Since my behavior always perplexed those around me, I wanted to understand what goes on inside a procrastinator's mind and why we act the way we do.
I wanted to explain to those who aren't procrastinators out there that I believed there must be differences between the brains of procrastinators and those who aren't.
In order to verify this, I found a place that would take MRIs of my brain and the brain of someone who is definitely not a procrastinator, and I decided to compare them.
I have brought the results here with me today.
I hope you'll pay close attention to see if you can spot the differences.
Though the differences might be hard to spot unless you're a brain specialist, well, anyway, please take a look.
This is the brain of someone who is not a procrastinator.
In contrast, there is the Rational Decision-Maker.
As for my brain --
This is the difference between the two: the Instant Gratification Monkey.
Both brains have a 'Rational Decision-Maker,' but in the procrastinator's brain, there is also an 'Instant Gratification Monkey' present.
How does this relate to procrastination?
Everything is going well up until this point.
"The Rational Decision-Maker decides to do something productive, making a rational decision to do a bit of work, but the Monkey doesn't like that. So it takes the wheel and suggests, 'Hey, remember that thing with Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding? Let's read the Wikipedia article about that.'"
Then â€” I have to go check the fridge and make sure nothing has changed in there since ten minutes ago.
After that, there's the YouTube spiral waiting, starting from a video where Richard Feynman talks about magnets, and then proceeding all the way to watching an interview with Justin Bieber's mom.
So I'm pretty tied up for now, and unfortunately, I'm done for today.
"There's no room to squeeze in any work."
What's going on?
The monkey is not the entity you want to be taking the helm.
They live only for the present moment.
With no regard for past memories or knowledge of the future, there are only two things that matter to them: what's easy and what's fun.
In the animal kingdom, this isn't a problem.
If a dog were to spend its life doing nothing but what's easy and fun, it would likely be considered a great success.
To the monkey, humans are merely another type of animal.
As long as they ate well, slept well, and produced the next generation, it might have been fine during the times when they lived a primitive life.
We are no longer living a primitive lifestyle.
We live in an advanced civilization, but the monkey has no idea what that means.
The reason there's another 'Rational Decision-Maker' in the brain is to provide us with abilities not found in other animals.
We can imagine the future
We can see the big picture
We can make long-term plans
The Rational Decision-Maker takes everything into consideration
Now, I'm trying to let myself do what I should be doing.
There are times when it makes sense to do what's easy and fun, such as during dinner time, bedtime, or leisure hours.
There are overlapping parts between the two.
There are times when our opinions align as well.
However, as a general rule, there are times when it makes sense to do something difficult and not very enjoyable.
Conflicts arise at such times.
In the case of procrastinators, this conflict tends to always result in spending a lot of time in the area represented in orange, doing easy and fun things that don't make sense to do.
I refer to this area as the "Dark Playground."
The Dark Playground is a place well-known to all procrastinators.
It's the place where you end up playing when you're not supposed to be playing.
The fun in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun; it's a pleasure that shouldn't be had, filled with familiar feelings of procrastination such as guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-loathing.
The question is how procrastinators, with the monkey at the helm, can move into the blue zone, a less comfortable but truly important area where things happen.
In fact, procrastinators have a guardian angel that is always watching over them, even in the worst of times; it is also known as the "Panic Monster."
The Panic Monster, usually asleep, suddenly wakes up when scary endings like looming deadlines, potential disgrace, or professional crises approach.
The crucial point is that this is the only thing the monkey truly fears.
Very recently, I had the opportunity to do just that, when the folks at TED reached out to me six months ago, inviting me to give a TED Talk.
Of course, I said 'yes'.
Being able to say "I once gave a TED Talk" was a long-standing dream of mine.
In the midst of this excitement, the Rational Decision-Maker is worrying about something else.
"Do you realize what you've signed up for?"
"Do you have any idea what's going to happen someday in the future?"
We really need to sit down and start working on it right now!
The monkey responds, "I totally agree, but how about we open up Google Earth, zoom into the bottom of India to sixty meters above ground level, scroll for two and a half hours to reach the top end, and by then, wouldn't we have a pretty good grasp of India's landscape?"
And so, I spent the entire day just doing that.
Six months became four, then two, then one, and TED released the list of speakers.
When I opened the page, there was my face staring back at me.
So who woke up?
The Panic Monster went berserk, and immediately the entire system fell into chaos.
Remember that the monkey fears the Panic Monster, and it will flee to the treetops.
Finally, the Rational Decision-Maker was able to take the helm, and I was able to start preparing for the lecture.
Due to the Panic Monster, the procrastinator's erratic behavior can also be explained, such as being unable to write even the first line of a report over two weeks, then miraculously awakening to a strong work ethic and churning out eight pages in an all-nighter.
This is the entire situation with the three characters involved, the procrastinator's system.
It's not pretty, but it works in the end.
This is what I decided to write about on my blog two years ago.
When I wrote about it, I was surprised by the reaction to the blog.
Literally thousands of emails poured in from all around the world, from a remarkably diverse range of people.
Nurses, bankers, artists, engineers, and a remarkable number of graduate students.
Everyone was saying the same thing: "I have the same problem."
However, the lightness of the blog post was in stark contrast to the weight of the emails I received.
They were written with a strong frustration about the impact procrastination was having on their lives, detailing what they were going through because of the monkey.
I wondered, what does it take for the procrastinator's system to function?
Why are they in such a bleak state?
What I realized is that there are actually two types of procrastination.
In the examples I've discussed, there were deadlines.
When there's a deadline, the impact of procrastination is confined to a short period, and the Panic Monster emerges.
However, there is another type of procrastination where there is no deadline.
In the case of entrepreneurial jobs, like those of individual entrepreneurs or artists, there are no deadlines at first because nothing happens until you go out and do something to get it off the ground and running.
There are also many important things outside of work that don't have deadlines, such as visiting family, staying fit through exercise, building relationships, or resolving troubled connections.
If the mechanism for a procrastinator to tackle challenging tasks relied solely on the Panic Monster, there would be a problem, because in situations without deadlines, the Panic Monster doesn't appear.
Without anything to jolt us into action, the effects of procrastination are unbounded, leading to a perpetual continuation of putting things off.
Such long-term forms of procrastination are less visible and less talked about than comical, short-term procrastinations with looming deadlines; typically, they result in a quiet, personal torment.
Long-term and significant misfortunes or regrets
I realized that this could be the reason why those people wrote the emails, and why they found themselves in such terrible situations.
You're not stuck in limbo on some project.
Long-term procrastination makes you feel like a bystander in your own life.
Their frustration doesn't stem from being unable to achieve their dreams, but from being unable to even start pursuing them.
While reading through those emails, I had a realization - there's no such thing as someone who isn't a procrastinator.
We're all procrastinators.
Even if you're not as chaotic as me, you might have a healthy relationship with deadlines. But please remember that the most insidious issue with the Instant Gratification Monkey is when there's no deadline.
Finally, there's one more thing I'd like to show you.
It's called the "Life Calendar."
Each box represents a week in a 90-year lifespan.
It's not as if we have so many left, plus we've already used up quite a bit.
I think we should all take a good look at this calendar.
Because everyone must be procrastinating on something, it makes you consider what exactly you are putting off.
We need to be aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey that wants instant rewards.
This is a task for all of us.
Considering that there aren't that many boxes left, we should probably start this job today.
Well, even if not right away today,
If possible,
Sooner rather than later
Thank you.
