At that moment, I was waiting in fear for the last moments of my life in a Texas church packed with souls and bodies.
Right in such a venue, I was sitting lightly on a dilapidated wooden chair covered in a red rag, with an organ to the left, the choir waiting behind, and further back, a baptismal font was prepared.
There was no change whatsoever.
The intense tension, earnest desire for salvation, sweaty palms, and the people sitting at the back who seemed rather uninterested.
On the night of December 31, 1999, the eve of Christ's return, it was when I believed the world was going to end.
That year, I had just turned twelve, the age at which one is officially recognized as a full member according to the scriptures.
Even so, I felt like complaining that it was unfair for the world to end just as I had become old enough to be considered a full member according to the scriptures, but it was all for naught. I was forced to reconsider my future.
Renewing my spirit, I made every effort to attend church.
I prayed so earnestly that I lost track of time, desperately hoping that God would notice my lack of faith and not hasten His arrival earlier than scheduled.
In an added precaution, I was reading through books that were popular at the time, the kind that said things like "Please save me," just to be sure.
At one point, I came across a passage that spoke of the fateful hour, warning that should anyone's faith be found lacking, further tragedy awaited.
In any case, the task set before me was to control all desires, overcome the devil and inertia, and triumph over my own disbelief.
Let's believe it's possible, even though it's tough at twelve.
The time was drawing ever closer.
23:50
The remaining ten minutes, the pastor gathered us before the altar so that we could meet the moment when the clock's hand pointed to the fateful hour, together with deep prayer.
People of all denominations will gather in one place.
The choir remained in their seats, and the deacons and their ladies - so to speak, the bourgeois church members - took their positions in the front row of the altar.
As you know, even for the second coming of Christ in America, there are VIP seats prepared.
(Applause) Right behind those VIPs are the seniors, who worked tirelessly under the scorching sun of East Texas in the cotton fields when they were young; their leathery, wrinkle-free skin, as if it is the earth itself. They are people who have held dreams of what life could have been like if they had taken different paths, whose hopes have been betrayed time and time again. Yes, those are the very people.
They are, in fact, the main characters in my story.
They had dedicated their entire lives to this moment, much like their medieval forebears awaited the day of reckoning, finding their purpose in a talk show that began every day at four o'clock.
Like my grandmother, she too moved toward the front of the altar, and I stealthily followed her back, convinced that my grandmother was surely destined for heaven.
I thought that if I held her hand while we prayed, perhaps I could go to heaven with her.
I clasped my hands, closed my eyes, listened intently, and prayed.
The pastor's voice was rough and forceful.
The responsive prayers turned into shouts, echoing throughout the church.
The keyboard melody swelled with increasing intensity.
The accompanying fervor envelops the church.
To ensure I wouldn't be left behind, I gripped my grandmother's hand once more.
Faced with the terror of the impending fate, I retreated into the darkness behind my eyelids.
And then that voice descends, "Amen."
It has ended.
The clock's hand is
The fateful hour has already passed.
The savior did not appear, and I gazed upon them, trying not to reveal their disappointment, for I had closed my eyes too deeply and for too long, unable even to perceive the new possibilities that lay before us.
The sight of them filled me with a pang of heartache.
They had been deceived, victims of a falsehood, and I, too, was among them.
I had been continuing to pray, never neglecting my efforts to resist temptation.
I, who had undergone the baptism of that trial not once, but twice, held onto my belief.
Indeed, up until that moment.
When I returned home and turned on the TV, Peter Jennings was celebrating the dawn of the new millennium, and that news was being broadcast around the world.
At that moment, a strange thought crossed my mind; would God, taking time zones into consideration, descend multiple times?
This notion was utterly ridiculous, and yet cruel.
However, even so, I did not stop believing.
And I embrace a new belief, the belief that there is not just one answer.
My answer was wrong; the question itself was wrong; it is the belief to confront that injustice.
A new ray of sunshine pierces the frozen, still winter mountain called "faith." The melting snow of possibility begins to flow towards yet unseen landscapes.
I still look back and think about that night when the savior did not come, how in an instant, what I had believed crumbled away. Even if it wasn't a lie, the moment I knew it wasn't the truth.
Among the many people who celebrated the moment of the year 2000 in entirely different ways, there may be some who, after undergoing a similar course as I did, have ended up here. Starting from the dawn of the new millennium, my mother left, communication with my father ceased, and even God seemed to have forsaken me on that day.
I reached out my hand, determined to grasp something to believe in, once and for all.
At eighteen, I enrolled in Yale University, thinking at the time that it was the perfect opportunity to leave behind all the dark past I had witnessed in Oak Cliff, Texas; the shattered dreams and lost hopes of people, a chance to sever ties with all that darkness.
However, one day during the winter break, I found myself face down on the floor of my home, my hands bound tightly behind my back, with a robber pressing a gun to my head. And it was then that I finally realized, education would not save me either.
In 2008, I reached out for my next salvation, which was a company called Lehman Brothers.
With a bright future ahead, I quickly call home, determined not to suffer for money anymore.
But even the heart of finance crumbled before my eyes with a resounding noise, and I was abandoned even in the business world.
Undeterred, I reach out for the next hope as a youth staff in Washington. The voices coming from Illinois cry out loudly, "The time has come," "Change will be brought to America."
However, Congress stumbled, the nation seemed to tear hopes apart, and "change" became a joke that couldn't be laughed at. Even if politics were to return, nothing happened; we were not saved.
I indeed pledged my allegiance at the altar named the American Dream, kneeling to the god of capitalism, for the sake of success, wealth, and power.
Nevertheless, at the stroke of midnight when the date changed, I kept my eyes open, wondering if there really was no God.
That night, I decided to confront once again, not because I was brave, but because I was left with no choice but to either die or believe; those were the only two options that remained for me.
And so, I moved on to the next holy ground, Harvard Business School, refusing the appealing offered salvation at this point because I knew better.
I still feel that my efforts are not enough.
It was not long after the harsh Cambridge winter had begun, on a certain night, in the quieter corner of a lively party where the topic arose with three friends. It was a common subject that most young people would have experienced at least once, a typical conversation born of youth: "Shall we go on a journey?"
I had not decided where I should go or how I should proceed.
But I was possessed by Jack Kerouac's novel; "To slip out into the night and vanish." We set off to find out what was really happening in this country.
Although there were many voices in opposition, and indeed, those voices made valid points, I took a step forward nonetheless.
In the summer of 2013, an 8,000-mile journey across America began. We passed through Montana's grasslands, Detroit's ruins, and the swamps of New Orleans. At each destination, we encountered people living their lives, conducting business to sustain their livelihoods, and witnessed their resilience in simply surviving day by day.
At the pinnacle of capitalist academia, I was, rather, being innovative.
This idea grew and transformed into a nonprofit organization called "MBAs Across America," and it was also this momentum that brought me to the stage of TED.
How voracious our generation is for purpose and meaning.
We realized the signs of this wave, recognizing the need for just a little more support for the countless entrepreneurs who, out of the public eye, generate employment and drive change.
We finally realized, and to be honest, another important aspect is that I made efforts to create my own wave.
The wounds of this teetering nation could be healed and comforted by each social enterprise, capable of helping it rise again; there was indeed a time when many people believed in such notions.
Yet, this missionary journey led me to a new gospel, and it is precisely this that brings me to stand here today.
About a year ago, one evening, I was at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, attending a gathering of Harvard Business School alumni.
Beneath the life-sized replica of a whale hanging from the ceiling, I sat alongside the era's influential figures, celebrating the achievements of our alma mater and honoring each other's spirit of social contribution.
The network of people gathered there, along with their assets, created a space brimming with pride, exceeding a staggering five trillion dollars.
When we look at what we have accomplished, it is all beautiful.
But that wasn't the end. Two days later, I had business to attend to in the Harlem area. I sat at a corner of a farm built on what was once an empty lot, listening to stories about the children who came to the farm every day from a man named Tony.
These are stories of children living below the poverty line.
They hold onto their belongings even when they sleep, to prevent them from being stolen at the homeless shelter.
Children come to Tony's program, aptly named "Harlem Grown," seeking one meal a day.
After driving a taxi for nearly 20 years, Tony used his pension to start the program.
He wasn't paid a salary, due to financial struggles as the operation expanded.
He said he was willing to cling to any straw.
And I resolve to become that straw for them.
On my way back, a dull sound echoed deep within my chest, and tears simply streamed down my face.
I was so ignorant that under one roof, a whale replica hung suspended, and people capable of moving half a trillion dollars gathered, yet just two days later, barely fifty blocks north under another sky, there was a man who was running around unpaid, preparing meals for children.
I did not weep for inequality, nor out of pity for the hungry and homeless children, nor from anger at the wealth held by the 1%, nor from sympathy for the poverty of the 99%.
I was simply reeling from the fact that in a country plagued by kidney disease, I had become a dialysis machine myself.
I realized that my story exists for those who must keep walking, even if they have no shoes. My organization, and my voice, were meant to deliver effective aid to places long overlooked, like Harlem, Appalachia, and the disaster-stricken areas of New Orleans. What I was truly meant to convey were all the voiceless voices, seen as uneducated and innocent.
That epiphany utterly humbled me, and I remembered how Peter Jennings announced the new millennium, how I was deceived and cheated by the repeated injustices that kept unfolding, again and again.
I had been deluded.
But this time, I myself had become a false savior, having made quite a detour from that altar where, believing the world would end, I once stood. I had come to believe that suffering was atonement to God, that His word was everything, and that scripture alone held the truth.
After a long journey from the world I once believed in, I find myself standing once again at the starting point.
The era we live in is not one of disbelief; on the contrary, we believe no less than those in the past.
Some may believe in the words of Brené Brown, or perhaps it's Tony Robbins.
"The New Yorker" and "Harvard Business Review"
There must be those who believe in these as well, for are we not, above all, in this very temple of TED, dedicating our prayers? We want to believe, for belief is essential.
We ourselves long for a leader who will solve all our problems.
I have come to perceive that suffering is a necessary evil in the god of capitalism, and I am convinced that the gospel of technological progress is absolute.
But out of fear that the very foundation of what we believe in might crumble, when we neglect to question each element of that foundation, the resulting human toll tends to be overlooked.
If there's something you have no choice but to accept that is getting in your way, it's time to stop and reevaluate.
The gospel that preaches creativity, innovation, and responsibility towards society, environment, and economy is not within my domain.
I'm not actually trying to spread any doctrine-laden gospel here.
The existence of the gospel of doubt, that's why I am here.
This gospel isn't telling us to stop believing, it merely demands a new attitude, a mindset that recognizes there isn't just one answer.
It allows for the acceptance of past mistakes, acknowledging that the very act of questioning might also be flawed, embracing the irrationality that comes with it.
This gospel of doubt suggests that we, in this place and in this space, may be faced with the possibility that everything could be wrong.
"Why?" That question itself is the gospel.
Where is the necessity for people to suffer in vain, to the point of forsaking the power granted to us to question?
From this belief in reevaluation, I made a certain decision regarding my own endeavors; I turned "MBAs Across America" into a nonprofit organization.
We downsized our organization's staff, halted new hires, and made our business model public and shareable so that those who needed it could access it freely.
The reevaluation that was demanded of me was to abandon the role of savior that people had imposed upon me, because in the face of the truth that no miracles occur, our lifespans are far too short to wait for the Second Coming of Christ again.
This gospel of doubt should empower and give you hope, even when you despair and feel utterly lost, illuminating the path ahead. Even in times of hardship and pain, rather than drowning in the cessation of thought that is blind faith, the inner voice that urges reevaluation will shine as a small, faint, yet irreplaceable light, illuminating the darkness, even if it whispers.
Whether it's a cry, simply give voice to it: "There must be another way."
Thank you.
