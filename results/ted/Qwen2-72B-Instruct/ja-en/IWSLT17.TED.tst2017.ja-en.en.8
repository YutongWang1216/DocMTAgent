When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the heart of Zimbabwe's health policy.
At the end of a long war for independence, a new government emerged that promptly proclaimed socialist policies, making primary services like healthcare and elementary education essentially free.
They achieved a remarkable feat by significantly increasing local medical facilities, ensuring that roughly 80% of the population had access to healthcare within a two-hour walk.
When Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980, the country's childhood vaccination rate was just 25%.
By 1990, just a decade later, it had reached 80%.
I truly felt proud to be involved in this massive reform.
The people's excitement and solidarity were palpable.
I felt as though I was standing shoulder to shoulder with highly competent local scientists, doctors, and activists, not only as part of Africa's independence movements but also at the forefront of global public health initiatives.
However, there was a terrifying problem.
The first cases of AIDS in Zimbabwe were reported in the year I arrived, 1985.
While I had treated a few AIDS patients during my residency at Harlem Hospital in the early 1980s, I had no idea what was looming in Africa.
The HIV infection rate when I first arrived was around 2%.
By the time I left Harare 17 years later, it had skyrocketed to the point where one in four adults was infected.
By the mid-1990s, I was informing hundreds of people in their prime that they were HIV-positive.
I witnessed the deaths of colleagues and friends, and also saw the deaths of students and patients.
In response, my colleagues and I set up a clinic.
demonstrating how to use condoms or
initiating sex education in schools and workplaces, or
I also conducted case studies and provided preventive guidance to the partners of those infected.
I was dedicated, and at the time, I thought I was doing my best.
I believed I was providing excellent care, though in retrospect, it was inadequate.
However, I did not engage in activities that demanded structural reforms.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan candidly admitted that his own failures contributed to the genocide in Rwanda.
In 1994, when the genocide occurred, he was the head of UN Peacekeeping Operations.
At the tenth anniversary memorial service for the genocide, reflecting on that time, he said, "I was convinced that I was doing my utmost back then, but the genocide made me realize that there was more I could have done, more I should have done. I realized there were actions I could have taken to sound the alarm and gain support."
The AIDS epidemic caught the medical community off guard, and according to World Health Organization estimates, some 39 million people have lost their lives to AIDS so far, making it clear that I am not alone in wishing we had acted sooner.
However, during my time in Zimbabwe, I did not place myself in a position to advocate for change or consider political stances.
I was there to apply my professional skills, working as a clinician and as an epidemiological researcher.
In my heart, I believed my role was to care for patients, conduct investigations, and gain a deeper understanding of the infection patterns among the residents, hoping that this would help curb the spread of the virus.
I was aware that there was a higher risk of developing AIDS and dying among the socially disadvantaged.
On the sugarcane plantations, which resembled feudal estates more than any modern corporate organization, 60% of pregnant women were HIV-positive.
I taught that being infected did not mean a person was promiscuous, rather it was often a product of male-dominated cultures, coercive seasonal labor, and the legacy of colonialism.
The white population largely remained unaffected.
As healthcare workers, we were painfully powerless, reduced to merely pleading with individuals to change their behavior, to use condoms, and to reduce the number of sexual partners they had.
The infection rate continued to soar, and while antiretroviral drugs were developed in the West—still the most effective treatment for AIDS to this day—it was out of reach for the public sector across Africa.
I remained silent about the fact that life-saving medication was not equally accessible, and I did not speak out against the political and economic systems underlying the AIDS epidemic—the very mechanisms that had allowed for such a massive scale of infection.
I justified my silence, reminding myself that "I am not a citizen of this country, and if I sounded the alarm, there was a possibility of being expelled abroad, which would prevent me from doing good work, seeing patients, and conducting the research that was needed."
That's why I stayed silent, refraining from commenting on the government's then-current policies regarding AIDS.
I did not fully assert my own concerns.
Many doctors and other healthcare workers might think I had no fault.
It is a covenant between physician and patient—the Hippocratic Oath and its various iterations enshrine the sanctity of the relationship between doctor and patient.
I did everything I could, exhausting every option for each and every one of my patients.
However, I realized that such a massive epidemic reflected the distortions of society, stemming not just from biological causes, but rather from customs that marginalize, exclude, and discriminate against the vulnerable, rooted in prejudices related to race, gender, sexuality, and social class.
AIDS fits into this category.
The recent Ebola outbreak was similar as well.
Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer, who have been involved in anti-AIDS activities in Haiti, refer to this as "structural violence." The term "structural" is used because inequality is embedded in our society's political and economic structures, often invisible to those with privilege and power. The term "violence" is employed because the consequences of this phenomenon—early death, suffering, and illness—are indeed violent.
If we are to be of any help to our patients, we must not neglect to acknowledge these social inequalities.
Raising awareness is the first step in making public health work, allowing us to gather allies and forge a path together towards real change.
Therefore, recently, I have not been staying silent.
I am speaking out on many issues, even when it might make listeners uncomfortable, and even when it puts me in an awkward position to speak up.
In many cases, it concerns racial disparities and institutionalized racism – matters that should no longer be tolerated in this country, let alone in the medical field or public health.
Because of its existence, people are paying the price with their lives, unable to live out their full lifespan.
Therefore, sounding the alarm about racial discrimination in American healthcare, the ongoing structural and interpersonal violence, the violence inflicted upon people of color, is central to my mission as New York City's Health Commissioner. This includes addressing the legacy of pain inflicted by 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow laws, and 60 years of incomplete equality, all of which have fueled this violence in America.
The mortality rate for those under 65 is 50% higher for Black men compared to White men in New York City.
In 2012, the maternal mortality rate for Black women was more than ten times that of White women.
The infant survival rate has dramatically improved, yet black infants still face a risk of dying before their first birthday that is nearly three times higher than that of white infants.
New York is not unique in this regard.
Similar statistics can be found across America.
According to a recent analysis by The New York Times, there are reportedly 1.5 million missing Black men across America.
According to the article, today, more than one in six Black men aged 25 to 54 are missing from daily life, either incarcerated or having died young.
There is a stark injustice, a disproportionate violence that occurs daily, specifically targeting young Black men, the very violence that is the subject of protest known as #BlackLivesMatter.
However, what should be remembered is that despite varying incidence rates, common diseases and their outcomes continue to occur—conditions like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and AIDS, illnesses that lead to a slow and quiet demise. It is through premature deaths from these diseases that Black people are losing even more lives.
When the #BlackLivesMatter movement began, I felt a sense of frustration and anger, because in the medical field, there had even been an avoidance of using the term "racial discrimination" in research and work.
Every time I use this phrase, I wonder if it also resonates with you.
Despite medical students dressed in white coats protesting as if they were corpses, the majority of the medical community stood idly by doing nothing. This is concerning because the lingering discrimination continues to influence the manifestation of diseases and mortality rates. What I fear is
In the modern trend toward personalized and precision medicine, where we seek tailored treatments and pursue biological and genetic research, we risk losing sight of the bigger picture—the daily environment, where people live, grow, work, and love, is what most impacts people's health and is harming too many individuals' well-being.
As healthcare providers, we witness stark inequalities in our daily work, whether in clinics or in research. A homeless person may not follow a doctor's advice due to more pressing priorities. A transgender youth may contemplate suicide because of a brutally uncaring society. The burden of their children's health falls heavily on single mothers.
A physician's role as a healthcare provider is not merely to treat patients, but also to raise awareness and become an advocate for change.
A physician, regardless of the legitimacy, carries considerable weight in their words due to their social standing, and we must not waste this influence.
I vowed to myself that I would not remain silent as I had in Zimbabwe, and as New York City's Health Commissioner, I pledge to seize every opportunity available to me to raise awareness and call for collaboration in addressing healthcare disparities.
I will also confront racial discrimination, and I ask for your help. When you stand up against gender inequality, I will be there to support you, and I will do the same for any other form of injustice.
Now is the time for us to rise and collectively raise our voice against structural inequalities.
To call for change, you don't need to have all the answers.
All it takes is courage.
The health of our patients, and indeed all of us, hangs in the balance.
