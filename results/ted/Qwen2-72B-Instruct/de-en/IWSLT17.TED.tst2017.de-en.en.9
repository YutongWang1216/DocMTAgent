Most people have never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.
Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.
This goes back to the decision that Roy made three years ago.
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,
the TV production company of Amazon.
He is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog haircut, and describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos".
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce.
Of course, this is a very competitive industry.
There are already so many TV series that Roy can't just choose any one.
He has to find shows that are very, very good.
In other words, he has to find shows that are way out on the right-hand side of that curve.
This curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the website IMDB. The rating ranges from 1 to 10, and the height indicates how many shows received this rating.
If your show is rated nine or higher, it's a winner.
Then you have a successful show.
These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all those shows that are addictive, where, after watching one season, your brain asks: "Where can I get more of these episodes?"
This type of show.
On the left side, here at this end, are shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- that should tell you enough about what's happening at this end of the curve.
Roy Price isn't worried about falling on the left side of the curve, because I think it takes a special kind of intelligence to underbid "Toddlers and Tiaras."
He is more concerned about the middle bulge, the average television - the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't inspire.
So he has to make sure that he is really on the right side.
The pressure is on, and of course, this is Amazon's first time doing something like this, so Roy Price wants to take no chances.
He wants to create successes.
He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.
He considers many ideas for TV shows and, through an evaluation, selects eight TV show candidates, then produces the pilot episode of each of these shows and posts them online, where anyone can watch them for free.
And when Amazon gives stuff away for free, you do take it, right?
Millions of viewers watch these episodes.
However, they don't know that they are being watched while watching these shows.
They are being watched by Roy and his team, who record everything.
They track when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or rewatch.
They collect millions of data points, using this information to decide which show they should produce.
In fact, they gather the data, process it, and the answer emerges: "Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican U.S. senators."
They made this show.
Does anyone know the name of this show?
Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can recall this show, because it wasn't that good.
It's just an average show - literally - as the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 - so slightly above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team were aiming for.
Around the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. His name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the programming manager for Netflix. Just like Roy, he is always on the hunt to find that one super show, and he uses data for that too, but he does it a little differently.
Instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on Netflix viewers, namely the ratings they give shows, their viewing patterns, which shows they like, etc.
They use this data to uncover these little details about the viewers: what shows they like, what producers, what actors.
When they had all the pieces together, they took a risk and decided to make not a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator.
Do you know this show?
Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix scored a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.
"House of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on that curve. So right where they wanted to be.
Of course, the question now is: What happened here?
You have two very competitive, data-savvy companies.
They combine all these data points and it works incredibly well for one of them, but not for the other company.
What is the reason for that?
Because the logic somehow dictates that this should work across the board.
When you collect millions of data points for a decision you make, you should be able to make a good decision.
One has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.
One optimizes it through very powerful computers.
The least one can expect is good television, right?
If data analysis doesn't work this way, then it's somewhat alarming, because we live in a time when we increasingly rely on statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond just television.
Does anyone here know the company Multi-Health Systems?
Nobody. Okay, that's actually good.
Multi-Health Systems is a software company, and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. If you come into contact with it, you're in prison.
If someone here in the U.S. is in prison and requests parole, it's likely that this company's data analysis is used to determine whether parole is granted or not.
Just like at Amazon and Netflix. But instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it's decided whether a person will be good or bad.
Average television, 22 minutes, that can truly be awful, but more years in prison are worse.
Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite all the data,
does not always yield the best results. It's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems doesn't know how to use data.
Even the most data-savvy companies can get it wrong sometimes.
Yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes.
In 2009, Google announced that they could predict outbreaks of severe flu through data analysis - by analyzing Google search data.
It worked wonderfully and became a major news sensation. The success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature".
It worked flawlessly, year after year after year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,
and no one could say why.
It simply didn't work, which was once again a sensation, including the retraction of the publication in the magazine "Nature".
Even the most data-savvy companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.
Despite all these flaws, data is increasingly flowing into life's decisions -- at the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine.
So we had better make sure that data is helpful.
I am also familiar with many difficulties involving data. I work in computational geneticsâ€”a field where some very smart people use unfathomably large amounts of data to make serious decisions, such as those concerning cancer therapies.
or the development of a drug. Over the years, I have noticed certain patterns regarding the difference between successful decisions based on data and unsuccessful ones. This pattern should be disseminated.
When you ever have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:
First, you break down the problem into its components so that you can analyze the pieces; second, you put the pieces back together to make a decision.
Sometimes you have to do this multiple times, but it's always two things: taking apart and putting back together.
And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.
Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only aid in breaking down a problem and understanding its parts.
They are not suited to put the pieces back together and then come to a conclusion.
For that, there is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.
If there is something that the brain is good at, it is putting pieces and parts back together, even when the information is incomplete, to then make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.
That's why I believe Netflix was so successful, because they used data and reason where they also belong in the process.
They use data to better understand their audience, to do what they otherwise would not have been capable of. But the decision of how to take all these pieces, put them back together, and make a show like "House of Cards," that was not in the data.
Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they were taking a significant personal risk with this decision.
Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.
They used data to drive all their decisions, first when they were competing for TV ideas, then when they selected "Alpha House" as a show.
It was a safe decision, because they could always say: "That's what the data tells us."
It did not lead to the desired result.
Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go awry when data starts to drive our decisions.
No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and to not forget that, this device is pretty useful.
Many of you will...
Before there were data, this was the device for making decisions.
Many know it.
It's also known as the "Magic 8 Ball." It's amazing. For decisions via a yes or no question, all you need to do is shake the ball to get an answer. "Most likely" -- right here at this moment.
I will settle it later with a tech demo.
I have made some decisions in my life so far, where in retrospect, I should have listened to the ball.
But, as you naturally know, when you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, like data analysis, to make better decisions.
But this does not change the fundamental structure.
So perhaps the ball gets smarter and smarter and smarter. Ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.
And I find this to be a very encouraging message, that despite the vast amount of data, it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what one does, and to take risks.
Because in the end, it's not the data, but the risks that get you to the right end of the curve.
Thank you very much.
