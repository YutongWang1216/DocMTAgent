What do you think when you look at me?
A creditor? An expert?
Perhaps even a sister.
Or oppressed, subjected to brainwashing, a terrorist?
Or simply a delay at the airport security check.
That is indeed true.
I do not hold you responsible for your negative impressions.
This is how the media portrays people who look like me.
A study found that 80% of the reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative.
Studies show: Americans think that most people would not know any Muslims.
People probably don't talk to their Uber drivers.
For all those who have never met a Muslim: It's great to get to know you.
I tell you who I am.
I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with extra cream.
I am introverted,
a wannabe fitness fanatic,
and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim woman.
But not singing like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not born this way.
I have decided to do so.
When I was 17 years old, I made the decision to come out.
No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim woman. I decided to wear the hijab, my head covering.
My feminist friends were horrified: "Why are you oppressing yourself?"
The funny thing was: Back then, it felt like a feminist declaration of independence for me, specifically against the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old to conform to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.
I did not simply passively accept the faith of my parents.
I have wrestled with the Quran.
I read it, thought, questioned, doubted, and ultimately believed.
My relationship with God was not love at first sight.
It was a matter of trust and gradual surrender, deepening with each reading of the Quran.
The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.
I see myself in it. I feel that God knows me.
Have you ever had the feeling that someone perceives you, understands you completely, and yet somehow loves you?
That's what it feels like.
Later, I got married and, like all good Egyptians, began my career as an engineer.
I later had a child after my marriage, and essentially lived the "Egyptian-American Dream".
Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.
Many of you probably remember exactly where you were.
I was sitting in my kitchen, had just finished breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking news".
There was smoke, planes were flying into buildings, people were jumping from the buildings.
What was that?
An accident?
A technical malfunction?
My shock quickly turned to outrage.
Why would someone do such a thing?
I switched the TV channel and heard: " ... Muslim terrorists ...," " ... in the name of Islam ...," " ... of Middle Eastern descent ...," " ... Jihad ...," " ... bomb Mecca!"
"Oh, my God."
It wasn't just my country that was attacked, but in an instant, the actions of others transformed me from a citizen into a suspect.
On the same day, we had to drive across the Midwestern United States to move to a new city and start our graduate studies.
I remember feeling, as we drove in silence, that I sank as deep as I could into my seat, and for the first time, I feared being recognized as a Muslim.
That night, we moved into our apartment in a new city that felt like a completely different world.
And then I heard, saw, and read the warnings from national Islamic organizations, which stated: "Be vigilant", "Be cautious", "Stay in well-lit areas", "Do not congregate".
I stayed inside all week.
Then came Friday that week - the day when Muslims gather to pray.
And again the warnings were: "Do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a target."
I watched the extensive coverage.
The emotions were understandably raw, and I heard about attacks on Muslims or those perceived as Muslims, dragged outside and beaten.
There were indeed arson attacks on mosques.
I thought: We should stay at home.
But something didn't feel right.
Because the people who had attacked this country had attacked our country.
I experienced the people's anger at the terrorists.
Imagine that! I was angry too.
It is not easy to constantly have to explain oneself.
I have nothing against questions, I love questions.
It is the accusations that are hard.
These days, we can actually hear people say: "There's a problem in this country -- it's called Muslims.
"When will we get rid of them?"
Some people want to ban Muslims and close down mosques.
They speak of my community as if it were a tumor in the body of the USA.
The question arises: Are we malignant or benign?
They know: a malignant tumor is removed entirely, and a benign tumor is kept under observation.
The alternatives are pointless, because the question is wrongly posed.
Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.
Thank you!
Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.
Will the closure of mosques make America safer?
It might free up a few parking spaces, but it won't stop terrorism.
Regular attendance at a mosque leads to viewing people of other faiths more tolerantly, and showing greater civic engagement.
And as a police chief in the Washington, D.C. area recently told me: People are actually not radicalized in mosques.
They are radicalized in their basements or in bed in front of a computer.
In the radicalization process, it has been observed that it starts online. First, the individual is isolated from their community, even from their family, so that the extremist group can perform brainwashing that leads the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who despises their behavior and ideology is a traitor or has fallen from the faith.
If we want to prevent radicalization, we need to encourage people to go to the mosque.
Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.
Ultimately, a group like ISIS justifies its brutality with the Quran.
As a Muslim woman, as a mother, as a human being, I believe we must do everything in our power to stop a group like ISIS.
But we would be playing into their fantasy if we accept them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.
Thank you!
ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan has to do with Christianity.
Both groups claim that their ideology is based on their "Holy Book".
But when you look at them, what drives them is not what they read in their "Holy Scripture".
It is their brutality that leads them to read these things into the scripture.
A prominent Imam recently told me an astonishing story:
A girl came to him because she intended to join ISIS.
I was truly surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.
He said the problem was precisely the opposite. Every cleric she had spoken to silenced her, telling her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only land her in trouble.
Uninspired and lacking something that would give meaning to her anger, she became a prime target for exploitation by extremists who promised her a solution.
This imam restored her connection to God and her community.
Instead of blaming her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for real change in the world.
What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining ISIS.
This was a glimpse of how Islamophobia affects me and my family.
But how does it affect ordinary Americans?
How does it affect everyone else?
How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy, our freedom of thought?
A study - actually several neuroscientific studies - shows: When we are afraid, at least three things happen.
We are more likely to accept an authoritarian government system, conformity, and prejudices.
A study shows: When subjects are presented with news reports that portray Muslims negatively, they are more likely to support military strikes on Muslim countries and the curtailment of rights for American Muslims.
This is not just an academic issue.
When you look at when sentiment against Muslims spiked - between 2001 and 2013 - it happened three times, but never in conjunction with terrorist attacks.
It occurred in the lead-up to the Iraq War and during two election cycles.
So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terrorism, as I had expected.
It can indeed be a tool for manipulating the public, eroding the foundation of a free society that has rational and well-informed citizens.
Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.
We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.
Assigning collective guilt is not just about having to explain oneself.
Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both of them were in school.
Deah was an athlete.
He was at the dental school, talented, very promising...
His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.
She visited him there and he showed her his resume. She was amazed and said:
"When did my little brother turn into such a refined young man?"
Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just as he did to Yusor's sister, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon. He did it in their apartment, execution-style, after posting remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page.
He shot Deah eight times.
Fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also deadly.
So back to the beginning.
What happened after 9/11?
Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safely at home?
We discussed it, and for us, it was not an easy decision, for it came down to what kind of America we wanted to leave for our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we could freely practice our religion.
We decided to go to the mosque.
We drove silently with our son in his car seat, under high pressure to the mosque.
I took him out, removed my shoes, entered the prayer hall, and what I saw made me pause.
The hall was completely filled.
Then the Imam made an announcement, expressed gratitude, and welcomed our guests, for half of those gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers, who had come not to attack us, but to stand by us.
In that moment, I broke down.
These people were there because they had chosen courage and compassion over panic and prejudice.
What will you choose?
What will you choose in a moment of fear and fanaticism?
Will you play it safe?
Or will you join those who believe: We are better than them.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much!
Helen Walters: So, Dalia, it seems you've struck a nerve.
But I wonder, what do you say to those who might argue that you are giving a TEDTalk, you are a deep thinker, working in a prestigious think tank, hence you are the exception and not the rule.
What would you say to those people?
Dalia Mogahed: I would say, do not be mistaken. I am completely normal.
I am not an exception.
My story is not unusual.
I am as ordinary as it gets.
When you look at Muslims around the world, and I did this with the largest ever study on Muslims globally, people want normal things.
They want prosperity for the family, they want employment, and they want to live in peace.
Therefore, I am in no way an exception.
When people seem like an exception to the rule, it is often the rule that has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.
HW: Thank you very much. Dalia Mogahed.
