What started as a platform for tinkerers is about to become a billion-dollar business.
Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film, and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. This is made possible in research institutions worldwide.
Before air package delivery entered our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft built a six-meter-high tower out of 1,500 bricks live in front of an audience at the FRAC Center in France. A few years ago, they began flying with ropes.
By linking together, the aircraft achieve high speed and acceleration in tight spaces.
They can also build self-loading structures independently.
They have learned to carry loads, cope with turbulence, and generally react to the laws of nature.
Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.
Our goal is to transcend the boundaries of what's possible in autonomous flight.
For a system to function autonomously, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in space.
In our lab at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to locate objects. This allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.
For today's demos, we are using a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a spin-off of our lab.
There are no external cameras.
Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine its position in space, and onboard calculations determine what the aircraft should do.
External commands are given at the highest level, e.g., "take off" and "land".
This is a so-called tail starter,
an aircraft that tries to kill two birds with one stone.
Like other fixed-wing aircraft, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.
Unlike most fixed-wing aircraft, it can hover, giving it significant advantages during takeoff and landing, and making it very versatile.
However, there is always a downside.
A limitation of tail-sitters is that they are sensitive to turbulences such as gusts of wind.
We are developing new controls and algorithms to improve this.
The idea behind this is that the aircraft can regain its optimal position regardless of its orientation, and performance can be improved through practice.
Okay.
During our research, we often grapple with fundamental abstract questions that get to the heart of the matter.
Such a question, for example, would be: What is the minimum number of movable parts required for controlled flights?
There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.
Helicopters are essentially machines with a thousand moving parts, all conspiring to hurt you.
Decades ago, trained pilots could fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a rudder.
Recently, we discovered that flying works with just one.
This is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-controlled aircraft. It was invented recently.
It has only one moving part, a propeller,
no flaps, hinges, or rudders, no additional actuators or control surfaces, just one propeller.
Although it is mechanically simple, a lot is happening internally to enable stable flight and the ability to move anywhere in space.
Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail starter. To get it to fly, I have to throw it just right.
The likelihood of throwing it just right with everyone watching is slim, so instead, I'll show you a video recorded last night.
If the monospinner is an exercise in frugality, then this machine here, the omnicopter with its eight propellers, is an exercise in abundance.
What to do with all this abundance?
You see that it is extremely symmetrical.
Therefore, it is ambivalent in its orientation.
This gives it the extraordinary ability,
to move in all directions in space, regardless of which direction it is turned or even how it rotates.
Naturally, it is complex, primarily in the area of interactive flows from the eight propellers.
Some aspects can be illustrated in models, the rest is learned directly during flight.
Let's take a look at that.
If aircraft are to become a part of our daily lives, they must become extremely safe and reliable.
This machine here consists of two separate twin-propeller aircraft.
This rotates clockwise
and the other counterclockwise.
When combined, they behave like a high-performance quadcopter.
However, should something go wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue flying, albeit with limitations.
We will now demonstrate this by rendering one half unable to fly.
The final demonstration examines synthetic swarms.
The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a spectrum of aesthetic expression.
We took off-the-shelf micro-quadcopters - each weighing less than a slice of bread - and equipped them with localization technology and algorithms.
Each unit knows where it is in space and is self-guided. That's why there's no upper limit.
Hopefully, these demonstrations inspire the conception of new revolutionary ideas.
The particularly safe machine over there aspires to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.
Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.
For people like us, the reward lies in the act of creation and development.
It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, intelligent beings to shape it in such spectacular ways.
The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.
Thank you very much.
