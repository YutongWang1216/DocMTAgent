I am a neurosurgeon.
Like most of my colleagues, I deal with human tragedies on a daily basis.
I know how your life can change in an instant, after a severe stroke or a car accident.
For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very limited ability to self-heal.
After a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.
That's probably why I became a functional neurosurgeon.
What is a functional neurosurgeon?
A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical measures.
Certainly, they have heard of one of the most famous, "deep brain stimulation." Here, an electrode is implanted deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that neurological function improves.
It is truly an amazing technology. It has improved the fate of Parkinson's patients who suffered from severe tremors and intense pain.
Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.
The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.
In my opinion, we are getting closer to this dream.
I want to show you that we are very close to it.
With a little help, the brain can help itself.
The story began over 15 years ago.
At that time, I was a senior attending physician, working day and night in the emergency room.
I often treated patients with head trauma.
You have to imagine that in cases of head trauma, the brain swells and the intracranial pressure increases.
To save a life, one has to reduce the intracranial pressure.
To do this, sometimes a portion of the swollen brain tissue must be removed.
Instead of discarding the swollen brain tissue, Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, and I decided to analyze the brain tissue.
What do I mean by that?
We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.
This is no easy task.
Growing cells from a piece of tissue is comparable to taking very small children away from their families.
One must find the right nutrition, temperature, humidity, and environments to let them thrive.
That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.
After many attempts, Jean-François managed to do it.
He saw that under his microscope.
This was a big surprise for us.
Why?
It looked exactly like a stem cell culture, with large green cells surrounded by smaller, immature cells.
Maybe you remember from biology class that stem cells are immature cells that can transform into any cell type of the organism.
The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. They are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.
It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass during surgery.
We made another fascinating observation: Normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly.
They never die, they are immortal.
But these cells behaved differently.
They divided slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.
So we observed a new, peculiar cell population that resembled stem cells but behaved differently.
It took us a long time to understand where they came from.
They originate from these cells.
These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.
We all have them in our brains.
They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.
They play a very important role in our development.
During the fetal stage, they are responsible for the folding of the brain.
But why do they remain available to us?
We do not know that. 
We believe that they are involved in brain healing, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries.
However, this is not entirely certain.
One thing is clear, however -- it is from these cells that we obtained our stem cells.
We are faced with a potential cellular source that enables brain healing.
We had to prove that.
So we decided to develop an experiment.
We wanted to take a piece of brain tissue from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells just as Jean-François did.
and subsequently color-mark them to be able to track them in the brain.
In the final step, we reimplanted them at the extraction site of the same individual.
We call this autologous transplantation - autotransplantation.
One of our initial questions was: What happens when we reimplant these cells into normal brain tissue? And what will occur when we reimplant the same cells into damaged brain tissue?
Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.
In the first scenario, we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they completely disappeared after a few weeks, as if they had been withdrawn again, they return home. The space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they vanish.
In the second scenario, we inflicted an injury and reimplanted precisely the same cells, and now the cells persisted -- they matured into neurons.
Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.
These are the cells that were reimplanted.
The proof they present are these little dots. These are the cells that we colored in vitro, in the culture.
We naturally could not stop here.
Can these cells also help a monkey recover from a brain injury?
So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.
They had to pick up food pellets from a tray.
They did this very well.
Once they had reached a stable level of dexterity, we injured the hand motor area in the motor cortex.
As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed; they could no longer move their hand.
Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree, much like after a stroke.
The patients are paralyzed and then attempt to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. They recover to a certain degree, just as with the monkey.
When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.
On the left side, you see the monkey who spontaneously recovered.
He can produce about 40% to 50% of his original performance prior to the injury.
He is not as precise and not as fast.
Now, see when we reimplanted the cells: The same monkey, two months after the reimplantation.
I can tell you, these were also very exciting results for us.
Since then, we have learned much more about these cells.
We can freeze them and use them later.
We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's.
But our dream is still to implant them in humans.
I truly hope that I will soon be able to show you how the human brain provides us with the means to heal itself.
Thank you very much.
Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, are thinking: "I know someone who needs this."
Me certainly. 
Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans.
Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are the authorities. Stemming from these great results, one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to undergo this kind of study.
BG: That is understandable, the brain is very delicate and so on.
JB: Yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience, and almost a professional team.
BG: Looking into the future - you have completed the research and are trying to obtain permission to start clinical trials. If you look further into the future, how many years will it take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.
JB: That's hard to say.
Firstly, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.
Will the authority allow us to start it soon?
Then, one has to conduct this study with a small group of patients.
It does take quite a long time to select the patients, carry out the treatments, and assess whether it is beneficial to perform this type of treatment.
After that, one has to apply it to a multi-center study.
One really has to demonstrate that it is useful before one can offer this treatment to everyone.
BG: And that it is safe, of course. JB: Of course.
Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and for telling us about it.
Bruno Giussani: Thank you very much.
