This is James Risen.
You may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.
Long before anyone had ever heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he spectacularly revealed that the NSA had illegally tapped the phones of Americans.
But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.
In it, he describes a disastrous US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed over blueprints for a nuclear bomb to Iran.
If that sounds crazy, read it.
It is an incredible story.
But do you know who really didn't like that chapter?
The U.S. government.
For almost 10 years, the government investigated Risen and asked him to name his alleged sources.
In this process, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of prosecuting whistleblowers and spying on journalists.
According to the First Amendment, the media have the right to publish secret information.
But it is impossible to exercise this right if the media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of those brave individuals who disclose it.
So when the government came knocking at Risen's door, he did what many brave journalists had already done before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to jail.
From 2007 to 2015, Risen therefore lived with the risk of going to jail.
But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.
Suddenly, despite years of insisting it was essential to their case, the government's demands of Risen were dropped.
The reason: In the era of electronic surveillance, reporters and their sources can hide less and less.
Instead of failing to make Risen testify, his digital footprints might do the job for them.
And so the investigators, without his consent, secretly obtained his phone records,
just like his email data, financial and banking information, his credit report, and even travel records including the list of his flights.
Amidst this information, they found evidence which they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and purported source for Risen.
Unfortunately, this is just one of many cases.
President Obama pledged upon taking office to protect whistleblowers. Instead, his administration has prosecuted more of them than all previous U.S. governments combined.
Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially since the government classifies too much of its work as secret.
Since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.
We are thus jeopardizing journalistic endeavors, which should be safeguarded by the First Amendment, as the government gains ever more means to spy on everyone.
But just as technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.
And they can do so from the moment they make contact, rather than retrospectively, from the witness stand.
Today, there is communication software that didn't exist when Risen wrote his book, and it is significantly safer than regular emails or phone calls.
One such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source submission system for whistleblowers, originally developed by internet celebrity and our late colleague Aaron Swartz, and has since been further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work.
Instead of sending an email, you go to a news website, like this one from The Washington Post.
There you can upload documents or send information, just like with any ordinary contact form.
These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.
Therefore, the government can no longer secretly obtain information, and much of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.
But SecureDrop is just a small part of the overall effort to protect press freedom in the 21st century.
Unfortunately, governments around the world are continually developing new espionage technologies that endanger us all.
It is up to us to ensure that not just tech-savvy individuals like Edward Snowden have a means to expose wrongdoing. It is equally important that we protect the next whistleblower,
someone who knows about malpractices in soldiers' care and wants to report on overcrowded hospitals. Or the next environmental worker sounding the alarm about Flint's contaminated water. Or a Wall Street insider warning us of the next financial crisis.
After all, these technologies were not created merely for those seeking to uncover crimes, but to protect all of our constitutional rights.
Thank you.
