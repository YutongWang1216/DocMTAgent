Democracy.
We in the West make a big mistake by taking them for granted.
We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it actually is, but as part of the inventory of our society.
We tend to view it as an immutable fact.
We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.
That is not true.
Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have definitively proven that it is entirely possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.
In fact, democracy is dwindling among us, in Europe.
At the beginning of the year, when I was representing Greece - the newly elected Greek government - it was made abundantly clear to me as Finance Minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process in our country - our elections - must not influence the austerity programs being implemented in Greece.
At that moment, I thought there could hardly be a better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my more rebellious friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it were to effect any change.
At this point, I would like to present to you an economic model for a genuine democracy.
I ask you to join me in believing once again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup have fallen prey to a false belief, that we can do without democracy, but rather, that we need a true and robust democracy.
For without democracy, our societies become meaner, our future bleaker, and our great new technologies are wasted.
Regarding the topic of waste, I would like to draw your attention to an interesting contradiction currently threatening our economies.
I call it the "Twin Peaks Paradox".
One peak you know well. You recognize it as the mountain of debt casting its long shadow over the US, Europe, and the entire world.
We all recognize the mountain of debt,
yet few recognize its twin.
A mountain of unused cash, belonging to wealthy savers and corporations, who are however too fearful to invest it where it would be productive and generate income that could pay down the mountain of debt and also produce all the things humanity urgently needs, such as "green" energy.
I give you two figures in this regard.
In the past three months, a total of $3.4 trillion has been invested in the US, the UK, and the Eurozone combined, in all the wealth-generating assets, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on.
$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money, until you compare it with the $5.1 trillion that was sitting idle in the same countries and our financial institutions at the same time, doing absolutely nothing except inflating stock markets and driving up real estate prices.
Thus, debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that do not balance each other out through normal market mechanisms.
The result is stagnant wages, over a quarter of those aged 25-54 unemployed in the US, Japan, and Europe, and consequently low aggregate demand, which in a vicious cycle fuels investors' pessimism, who fearing low demand, contribute to it by refraining from investing. Just like Oedipus' father, who out of fear that the oracle's prophecy might come true, that his son would kill him when he grew up,
unwittingly bringing about the conditions that lead to Oedipus killing him.
This is my struggle with capitalism --
its incredibly wasteful nature. All this unproductive capital should be deployed to improve our lives, nurture human talents, and especially fund all those technologies, "green" technologies, that are crucial for saving the Earth.
Is democracy then the solution?
I believe so. But before we proceed: What do we mean by democracy?
Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor, being the majority, control the government.
The Athenian democracy, of course, excluded far too many --
Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.
However, it would be a mistake to diminish the standing of Athenian democracy because of these exclusions.
The crucial aspect of Athenian democracy was and remains that it included the working poor, not only granting them the right to free speech, but more importantly and decisively, it accorded them the right to equal political participation and decision-making in matters of state with equal voting weight.
Although the Athenian democracy did not last long --
like a candle that burns very brightly, it also quickly burned out.
However, our contemporary liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,
but rather in the Magna Carta, in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and even in the American Constitution.
While Athenian democracy focused on empowering the free citizens and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which was ultimately a charter for rulers.
For liberal democracy only took hold when a complete separation of politics and economics became possible, with the democratic process confined to politics, while the economy – that is, the realm of corporations – became a democracy-free zone.
In our current democracies, since the inception of this separation between politics and economics, an unrelenting battle between the two has ensued, with the economy gradually undermining and disempowering politics.
Are you wondering why politicians aren't like they used to be?
It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.
This is because one can be in government today without being in power, given that power has migrated from politics to the economy and the two spheres have become disconnected.
I mentioned my struggle with capitalism.
When you think about it, it's rather like a pack of predators that has so sustainably decimated the animals it feeds on that it ends up starving as a result.
Similarly, the economy has cannibalized politics to such an extent that it is now hurting itself through the self-inflicted economic crisis. Corporate power grows, political goods are devalued, inequality rises, aggregate demand falls, and corporate executives are too frightened to invest their companies' cash reserves.
The more successful capitalism is in expelling the "Demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher the Twin Peaks will rise, and the greater the waste of human labor and the prosperity of humanity becomes.
If that is true, it is clear that we must bring politics and economics back together, and it would be better if, in doing so, the "Demos" retains control, much like in ancient Athens, except for the exclusion of slaves, women, and foreigners.
By the way, this is not a new idea.
The Marxist left had this idea over a hundred years ago, and it didn't end particularly well.
The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a status akin to that in ancient Athens through a miracle, without creating new forms of brutality and waste.
But there is a solution: Abolish the working poor!
Capitalism does this by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.
The problem is that as long as economics and politics remain separate domains, automation raises the Twin Peaks ever higher, magnifies the waste, and deepens social conflicts, much as I believe will soon be the case in countries like China.
We must therefore reshape the economy and reunite the domains of economics and politics, ensuring that we democratize the reunited domain; otherwise, we will end up in a pathological surveillance hyper-autocracy that will make the movie "The Matrix" seem like a documentary.
The question, then, is not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements it has produced --
The more intriguing question is whether capitalism will be supplanted by a dystopia akin to that depicted in "The Matrix," or by something resembling the society in "Star Trek," where machines serve people and humans channel their energy into exploring the universe, or perhaps into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian "Agora," indulging in lengthy discussions about the meaning of life.
I believe we have reason to be optimistic.
What, then, would it take, what might it look like, to have a "Star Trek"-like utopia instead of a "Matrix"-esque dystopia?
In practice, I would like to briefly mention a few examples to you.
In the realm of business: Envision a capital market where you earn money while you work, where your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to another, and where the company - no matter which one you are currently employed by - is owned by those who are currently working within it.
Then all incomes derive from capital and proceeds, and the concept of wage labor is utterly obsolete.
No more distinction between those who own the companies but do not work in them, and employees who work there but do not own the firm. No more tug-of-war between capital and labor, no vast gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no towering twin peaks.
In the realm of global political economy: Just imagine for a moment that our national currencies had floating exchange rates within a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of Twenty], in the interest of all humanity.
Imagine further that all world trade is conducted in this currency - let's call it "Cosmos", in units of "Cosmo" - and each government pays into a common fund the amount equivalent to its country's trade deficit or surplus.
Also imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world where investment funds are scarce.
This is not a new idea.
It is essentially what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference.
The problem was that one did not have the technical means to implement it back then.
Today, we have them, particularly against the backdrop of a reunited politics and economics.
The world I describe is simultaneously libertarian, in that it privileges the privileged, and Marxist, because it will have consigned the separation of capital and labor to the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian.
But above all else, it is a world where we can envision a genuine democracy.
Will we awaken in such a world?
or will we sink into a "Matrix"-like dystopia?
The answer depends on how we collectively decide politically.
It is up to us, and we had better do it democratically.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Yanis...
You describe yourself in your biography as a libertarian Marxist.
How relevant is Marx's analysis today?
Yanis Varoufakis: If anything I've just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.
The rationale for reunifying politics and economics is... Should we fail to do so, technological advancement will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers refers to as "secular stagnation."
By transferring this crisis from one part of the globe to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries with little interest in liberal democracy.
If this analysis is accurate, then Marx is indeed relevant,
just like Hayek, which is why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also utterly inconsistent.
BG: Indeed, and now we seem to be as well.
YV: If one isn't confused, one isn't thinking hard enough.
BG: That's a very Greek, almost philosophical explanation -- YV: Actually, it was Einstein who said that. BG: In your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China, and last night at the speakers' dinner, you very clearly stated your view on the Western perspective of China.
Do you want to repeat it here?
YV: There is a great deal of hypocrisy.
In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.
As I said in my lecture, we have confined democracy to politics, while the realm where most activity occurs - the economic sphere - is a completely democracy-free zone.
In a certain sense, if I may say so provocatively, China today resembles 19th-century England.
For -- let me remind you -- we tend to associate liberalism with democracy -- which is a mistake, historically speaking.
Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --
He was particularly skeptical regarding democratic progress.
What we observe in China now closely mirrors the progression we experienced in the UK during the Industrial Revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second phase.
Accusing China now of doing what the West did itself in the 19th century reeks mightily of hypocrisy.
BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Greece's Finance Minister at the beginning of the year.
YV: I had a feeling that was coming.
BG: Yes ...
How do you look back on the first half-year six months later?
YV: Very exciting, personally, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the Eurozone,
not just Greece, but the Eurozone,
namely, bidding farewell to our complacency, and the constant denial that a massive fault line runs through the Eurozone, and continues to run, severely threatening the development of the entire European Union.
We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first proposal to expose this denial --
to do it right. Unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the Eurogroup, have continued to choose denial.
But you know what's coming.
This is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to sustain an economically unviable system through political will and authoritarianism, one might be able to postpone the change for a while, but when it then occurs, it happens abruptly and destructively.
BG: What kind of change do you foresee?
YV: There is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.
BG: Did you make any mistakes during your time as Finance Minister?
YV: Every day.
BG: For example? YV: Anyone looking back -- seriously...
If there is a Finance Minister, or any minister for that matter, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims they made no mistakes, then that is a dangerous person.
Of course I made mistakes.
The biggest mistake was signing the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.
I believed that there was a genuine interest on the part of the creditors to find a common solution.
But that was not the case.
They merely wanted to topple our government, simply because they did not want to deal with the fault lines running through the Eurozone.
They were unwilling to admit that for five years they had been implementing a catastrophic program in Greece.
We lost one third of our nominal GDP.
It is worse there than during the "Great Depression".
None of the troika of creditors, who imposed this policy on us, would admit: "This was a colossal mistake."
BG: Despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the discussions, you still seem to be quite pro-European.
YV: Absolutely.
My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.
My greatest fear is that the Eurozone will not survive.
For if it does not survive, the unleashed centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.
This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.
We are probably the strongest economy in the world.
If we allow ourselves to embark on a postmodern version of the 1930s, as it appears to me, it will be equally detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.
BG: We hope very much that you are wrong on this point.
Yanis, thank you for being at TED.
YV: Thank you.
