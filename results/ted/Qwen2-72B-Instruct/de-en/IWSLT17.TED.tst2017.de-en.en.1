This week we were hit with news of a leak of 11 million documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.
The release of these documents provides a small glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.
We get a sense of how clients, banks, and lawyers approach firms like Mossack Fonseca and say: "Okay, we need an anonymous company. Can you set that up?"
We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the entire system works, how it operates.
This has already led to some very direct consequences.
Iceland's Prime Minister has resigned.
There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailbox companies in tax havens.
It is claimed that a trail of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, through a close childhood friend, a famous cellist.
There will now be a lot of wealthy individuals and others out there who are nervously awaiting the next release, and the next batch of leaked documents.
Now that sounds like the plot of a spy thriller or a John Grisham novel.
It seems far removed from you, me, ordinary people.
Why should that concern us?
But the truth is: When the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, it means less money for important public services like healthcare, education, roads.
And that affects us all.
For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.
Across the world, the media and leading politicians are discussing how a select few use secret tax havens to hide and obscure their wealth - something we have been discussing and exposing for ten years.
I think many people find this whole world very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.
I always imagine it like a Russian nesting doll.
So you have a company within a company, within another company, which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these entities.
It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society, to truly understand what is going on.
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA.
Probably because there were no prominent Americans involved in these revelations, in this scandal so far.
It's not that there are no wealthy Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.
However, due to the principle on which these tax havens operate, Mossack Fonseca had fewer American clients.
If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming, or Nevada, we would see many more cases and examples with connections to the USA.
In fact, it is true that in some U.S. states, you need to provide less information, less detail, to set up a company than to get a library card.
This kind of opacity in the USA has allowed school district employees to defraud schoolchildren.
It has allowed fraudsters to defraud particularly vulnerable investors.
It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.
Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out what all this looks like in practice.
How does this actually work?
So we sent an undercover investigator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.
Our investigator posed as an African minister looking to move suspicious funds into the USA to buy a house, a yacht, and a private jet.
It really shocked us that all but one lawyer gave our investigator suggestions on how he could transfer his money.
These were all preliminary discussions. None of these lawyers took us on as a client, and of course, no money was exchanged. But it illustrates the problem with this system.
It is also important not to view these as isolated incidents.
It's not about a single lawyer who presented suggestions to our undercover investigator.
It's not about a single top politician, embroiled in a scandal.
It's about how the system works, through which corruption, tax evasion, poverty, and instability are perpetuated.
And to address this, we need to change the rules of the game.
We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.
It may all sound rather bleak, as if there's nothing we can do about it; as if nothing ever changes; as if there will always be the rich and the powerful.
But as a born optimist, I do see that things have started to change.
In the last few years, we have seen moves towards greater transparency regarding the owners of companies.
The issue gained political attention when British Prime Minister David Cameron put it on the agenda at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.
Since then, the EU has been recording in central registers at the national level who really stands behind companies in Europe and who controls them.
One of the uncomfortable facts is that the USA is lagging behind in this regard.
Members of both parties have introduced a bill in both chambers of Congress, but it is not making the progress that we would like to see.
We would really like to see these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to push for greater transparency in the USA and globally.
For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.
We need ordinary people to get angry when they see others able to hide their true identity behind shell companies.
We need business leaders to stand up and say: "Lack of transparency is not good for business."
We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and work to end this type of opacity through legislation.
Together, we can finally put an end to the opacity that still enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption, and money laundering.
