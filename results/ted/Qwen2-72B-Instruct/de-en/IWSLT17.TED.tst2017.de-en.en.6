A while ago, I tried out an experiment.
For a year, I would say "Yes!" to everything I was afraid of.
No matter whether it made me nervous or put me in uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say "Yes".
Did I want to speak in public?
No, but yes!
Did I want to be on live television?
No, but yes!
Did I want to start acting?
No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.
And a crazy thing happened: Doing exactly what I was afraid of eliminated my fear.
My fear of giving speeches, my social anxiety -- poof, gone.
The power of a word is impressive.
"Yes" has changed my life.
"Yes" changed me.
But there was a particular "Yes" that profoundly changed my life, in an unexpected way. It started with a question from my youngest.
I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett, and Emerson. And Emerson, the youngest, for inexplicable reasons, calls everyone "honey,"
as if she were a southern waitress.
"Honey, I need milk for my sippy cup."
She once asked me if I could play with her when I was just about to leave. And I said: "Yes".
This "Yes" was the beginning.
of a new approach to life within my family. From then on, I vowed to always play with them whenever they asked me to. No matter what I was doing, or where I was going, I would always say Yes -- every single time.
Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm trying very hard.
It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.
But it also had a surprising side effect: Only recently did I fully realize that saying "Yes" to playing with my children saved my career.
I have a real dream job.
I am an author. I invent things, bring them to life.
Dream job.
No.
I am a Titan.
Dream job.
I create television. I produce television.
I make television, on a grand scale.
In this TV season, I am responsible for putting 70 hours of programming out into the world.
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV. Three to four shows are in production simultaneously.
Each show creates hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.
The budget for an episode of a television show can range between three and six million dollars.
Let's say five.
A new episode every nine days times four shows, so every nine days $20 million worth of TV, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production simultaneously, times four, 16 episodes in production at once: 24 episodes: Grey's, 21 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: How To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: The Catch, 70 hours of television,
$350 million for a season.
In America, my television series air back-to-back on Thursday nights.
My shows run worldwide in 256 regions, in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.
My mind operates on a global scale, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are shows that I've not just produced, but created myself, adding even more to my plate. I need to find time, truly quiet, creative time, to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.
Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows in production simultaneously, $350 million, campfires burning around the world.
Do you know who else does that?
No one, that's why I am a Titan.
Dream job.
I don't want to impress you with that.
I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" comes up.
I'm telling you this so that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country, or a classroom, manage a business or a household, take me seriously when I talk about work, so you understand that I'm not just tapping away on my computer and daydreaming, and it's true when I say: I get that a dream job isn't about dreaming.
It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.
I work a lot, hard, and I love it.
When I'm immersed in my work, there is no other feeling.
My work always creates a country out of nothing.
It's as if I'm marshaling troops, as if I'm painting on a canvas.
It's like hitting a high note, running a marathon.
One feels like Beyonc√©.
And all of that at the same time.
I love working.
It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and exhilarating, funny and disturbing, clinical and maternal, cruel and reasonable. And the best part about it, is the buzzing.
There is such a change in me when the work is going well.
A buzzing starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a lively street, one I could drive on forever.
Many people assume when I explain the buzzing to them, that I'm talking about writing, that writing brings me joy.
Don't get me wrong, it does.
But the buzzing -- when I started with television production, as I began to work and work and make, to build, to create, and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this buzzing, this energy. The buzzing!
The buzzing is more than the writing.
The buzzing is action and activity. The buzzing is a drug.
The buzzing is music. The buzzing is light and air.
The buzzing is God's voice in my ear.
And when you have that kind of buzz, you can't help but aim for greatness.
The feeling of being unable to do anything but aim for greatness, no matter the cost.
That's what they call the buzzing.
Or maybe it means being a workaholic.
Maybe it means being a genius.
Maybe it means having an ego.
Maybe it's the fear of failing.
I don't know.
I only know that I'm not made for failing, and I only know that I love the buzzing.
I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know that I do not want to question it.
Let me be clear: The more successful I become, the more shows, the more episodes, the more boundaries crossed, the more work there is, the more things happening simultaneously, the more eyes on me, the more history I'm writing, the more expectations there are.
The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.
And what did I say about work?
I love work, don't I?
The country I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high note, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing.
I like this buzzing. I love the buzzing.
I need the buzzing. I am the buzzing.
Am I just this buzzing?
And then the buzzing stopped.
Overworked, overstretched, exaggerated, burnt out.
The buzzing stopped.
Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is a singular work titan.
Harper tells people, "My mom won't be there, but you can write to my nanny."
And Emerson says, "Honey, I want to go to Shonda-Land."
They are the children of a titan.
They are baby titans.
They were 12, 3, and 1 when the buzzing stopped.
The buzzing of the engine fell silent.
I no longer loved my job. The engine had died.
The buzzing did not return.
My buzzing was broken.
I did the same things as always: The same titanic work, 15-hour days, working through weekends, no regrets, nothing delegated, a titan doesn't sleep, doesn't give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever it takes.
But there was no buzzing.
There was silence within me.
Four television shows, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.
Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...
I was the perfect Titan.
I was a poster Titan,
Everything was gray, I just wasn't having fun anymore.
And that was my life.
Everything I did.
I was the buzzing and the buzzing was me.
What does one do when what they do, the work they love, suddenly fades?
I know, some might think: "Go cry, stupid author-Titan."
But you know, you do it, one works, one loves what one does, be it teaching, banking, being a mother, a painter, being Bill Gates, one simply loves another and that gives one the buzzing, if one knows the buzzing, and knows how the buzzing feels, if one has known the buzzing before, when the buzzing stops, who are you then?
What are you?
What am I?
Am I still a Titan?
If the song of my heart ceases, can I survive in the silence?
And then my "Southern waitress" asks me a question.
I am on my way out, running late, and she says, "Mom, do you like to play?"
And just as I want to say no, two things become clear to me:
Firstly, I have to say yes to everything, and secondly, she didn't call me "honey".
She doesn't call anyone "honey" anymore.
When did that happen?
I miss being a Titan and mourn my buzzing, and here everything changes right before my own eyes.
And so she says, "Mom, do you like to play?"
And I say: "Yes".
There is nothing special about that.
We play and her sisters join in, we laugh a lot and I dramatically read from the book "Everybody Poops".
Nothing out of the ordinary.
But it is remarkable, because in my pain and panic, in the solitude and absence of the buzzing, there is nothing I can do but pay attention.
I am focused.
I am quiet.
The landscape I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high note - they no longer exist.
All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, soft voices, crayons, and the song about letting go, or whatever the girl in "Frozen" releases.
Peace and simplicity are everywhere.
The air at this place is so thin that I can hardly breathe.
I can hardly believe that I am breathing.
Playing is the opposite of working.
And I am happy.
Something within me is dissolving.
A mental door opens and a surge of energy comes in.
And not immediately, but it happens, it happens.
I feel it.
The buzzing slowly returns.
Not at full volume, barely there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.
Not the buzzing, but a buzzing.
And now I feel as if I know a magical secret.
But let's stay on topic.
It is love. That is all.
No magic. No secret. Just love.
It is something we have forgotten.
The buzzing, the work buzz, the Titan's buzz, that is just a substitute.
If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself through shows and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I have forgotten what the real buzzing is.
The buzzing is not a force and it is not work-specific.
It is dependent on the joy.
The real buzzing is dependent on love.
The buzzing is the current that comes from the zest for life.
The real buzzing is self-assurance and peace.
The real buzzing ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation, and the pressure.
The real buzzing is simple and original.
The real buzzing is God's voice in my ear, but maybe God whispered the wrong words to me, for which god told me that I am a Titan?
It is simply just love.
We all need a little more love, much more love.
Whenever my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.
I make this a firm rule, so I can absolve myself of any guilt as a workaholic.
It's a law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the buzzing again.
I wish it were that simple. I'm not good at playing, I don't like it.
Playing doesn't come close to how much working does for me.
The truth hurts,
but I don't like to play.
I always work, because I love it.
I would rather be at the workplace than at home.
This admission is painful, for what kind of person prefers working to being at home?
Well, me.
Let's be honest, I call myself a "Titan" --
I must have issues.
Being too relaxed is not part of any of those.
We race around the garden, back and forth, to and fro.
We have little dance parties,
we sing and play ball.
We burst soap bubbles.
In doing so, I mostly feel stiff, absent, and confused.
I always reach for my phone.
But it's okay.
My children show me how to live, and the buzzing of the universe fills me.
I play and play until I wonder: Why did we ever stop playing?
You can do it too! Always say yes when your child wants to play with you.
Maybe you think I'm naive, a daydreamer.
You may be right about that, but you can do it too!
You have time!
And do you know why? You are not Rihanna or a Muppet Show character.
Your child may find you less interesting than you think.
It's just 15 minutes.
My little ones want to play with me for no more than 15 minutes before they realize they'd rather be doing something else.
They are wonderful 15 minutes, but still just 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, I am replaced by a ladybug or a cookie.
If my teenage daughter talks to me for a whole 15 minutes, I am Mother of the Year.
It's just 15 minutes, no more is needed.
Everyone can spare 15 minutes at a time, even on a bad mood day!
15 minutes at a time!
No phone, no laundry, no distractions whatsoever.
The day is short: dinner, getting the kids ready for bed.
But 15 minutes are in there!
My children are my comfort zone, my world. It doesn't have to be children. The point is to feel the buzzing, to have a place for one's peace of mind.
It's not about playing with one's own children. It's about joy,
about playing in general.
Allow yourself the 15 minutes!
Find out what does you good. 
Find it out and keep it to yourself.
I'm not perfect at it. I fail and I succeed. Meeting friends, reading books, enjoying the day --
"Want to play?" is a shorthand for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show, when I became a Titan in training, when I wanted to outdo myself more and more.
Why not allow yourself a full 15 minutes at a time?
What could be wrong with that? Nothing!
The buzzing returned in my free time. The buzzing seems to come back when I'm not working.
Work doesn't function without play.
It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens, energy pours in, and I find myself back in my office. I hear an unfamiliar melody, it fills me and my soul. It inspires me with new ideas. The buzzing has carved out its path once more. I embrace it fully and fall in love with my work again.
I like the buzzing, but I don't love it.
I don't need it.
I am not the buzzing, the buzzing is not me... not anymore.
Bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.
This is now my buzzing.
The buzzing of life.
The buzzing of love.
The buzzing of work is part of me, but just a part now. And for that, I am so grateful.
I couldn't care less that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan play Journey to Jerusalem.
I said yes to less work and more play.
And yet, I have everything under control. My brain is still functional. My campfires are still burning.
The more I play, the happier my children and I are.
The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.
The more I play, the clearer my head becomes.
The more I play, the better I work.
The more I play, the more I hear the buzzing. The land I create, the marathon I run, the troops, the canvases, the high note, the buzzing, the other, the right buzzing: The buzzing of life.
The more I feel this buzzing, the more this unusual, quivering, raw, and new sense of life spreads within me. Less Titan -- more me!
The more I feel exactly this buzzing, the more I know who I am.
I am an author. I invent things, I bring them to life.
That comes with the job, it means living his dream.
This is the dream of this job,
because a dream job should be a little dreamy.
I said "Yes" to less work and more play.
Titans have no chance here.
"Do you want to play?"
Thank you very much.
