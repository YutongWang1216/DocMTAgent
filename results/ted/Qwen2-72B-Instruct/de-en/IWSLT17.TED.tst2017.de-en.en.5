About 1.3 billion years ago, in a very distant galaxy, two black holes orbited each other at an increasingly faster rate, converting the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.
For this brief moment, they shone brighter than all the stars combined in all the galaxies of our entire known universe.
It was a very big bang.
They did not release their energy in the form of light --
we are talking about black holes after all.
The entire energy was released into the fabric of spacetime itself, and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.
Let us first place the events in a temporal sequence.
About 1.3 billion years ago, multicellular life had just arisen on Earth.
Since then, Earth has produced quite a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans, and - God help us - even the internet.
About 25 years ago, a group of particularly brave individuals -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne, and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a massive laser detector to search for gravitational waves, such as those created by colliding black holes.
Most people considered them crazy.
But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so the US National Science Foundation funded their idea.
After decades of development, construction, design, and an enormous amount of hard work, they built the LIGO detector: the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.
In the subsequent period, the precision of LIGO could be significantly increased, greatly enhancing its detection capability.
Therefore, it is now called Advanced LIGO.
In early September 2015, LIGO was restarted for a final test run to resolve some smaller, persistent issues.
On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the detector went online, the gravitational waves from the collision of the two black holes swept through the Earth.
They went through you and me
and also through the detector.
Scott Hughes: Only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my terminally ill father. 
In essence, these were the fruits of my life's work.
Everything I had worked for is no longer science fiction!  AA: This is my good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, a theoretical physicist at MIT. He has been investigating gravitational waves from black holes and their measurable signals through observatories like LIGO for 23 years. But what are gravitational waves?
A gravitational wave is a ripple in the fabric of space and time.
As the wave passes, space and all its contents are stretched in one direction and squeezed in the other.
To illustrate this, instructors in relativity courses often perform a rather silly dance.
"Stretch and squeeze, stretch and squeeze."
The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even laughably so.
On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and squeezed by the passing waves. The stretching of an average person amounted to 10^-21.
That means 20 zeros after the decimal point, followed by a 1. That's why the LIGO team was considered crazy.
With a five-kilometer-long laser detector, which is already absurd, this length would have to be measured with a precision of less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. That is grotesque.
At the end of his classic text on gravitation
Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGO, described the pursuit of the waves as follows: "The technical challenges involved in building such detectors are enormous.
But physicists are inventive, and with the support of the public, certainly all obstacles will be overcome."
Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.
Back to LIGO. Scott likes to claim that LIGO is more of an ear than an eye.
I would like to explain what that means.
Visible light has a wavelength much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phone.
This is quite convenient. Because this allows you to create an image or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from multiple points around you.
It's different with sounds.
Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.
That's why it's extremely difficult, practically impossible, to create an image of things that matter to you particularly:
the face of your child, for example.
Instead, we listen for certain properties such as pitch and tone, rhythm and volume, to infer the story behind them.
"Now Alice is speaking."
"And Bob interrupts her."
"Foolish Bob."
The same applies to gravitational waves.
We cannot create simple images of objects in space with them.
But by listening for changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can hear their stories.
At least for LIGO, the measured frequencies fall within the audible range.
When we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speaking.
Listening to gravity can tell us a great deal about the collision of two black holes, a subject my colleague Scott has been deeply engaged with for a long time.
SH: Two non-spinning black holes simply chirp: beep!
If the two bodies are spinning rapidly, you hear the same chirping with an added pitch change. It sounds like this: woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!
It is a kind of motion vocabulary, inscribed in the wave form.
AA: On September 14, 2015 - a date I will never forget - LIGO heard the following: [Whirring sound] Someone who knows what to listen for recognizes this as the sound of - SH: ... two black holes, each with 30 times the mass of the Sun, spinning as fast as the blades of your blender.
AA: Let's take a moment to consider what this means.
Two black holes, the densest bodies in the universe, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, orbit each other a hundred times per second before they collide.
Imagine these forces.
Fantastic.
And we know about it because we have heard it.
In this lies the enduring significance of LIGO.
LIGO paves an entirely new path for exploring the cosmos, one that was never before possible.
In this way, we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.
Much in the universe we cannot see, practically or fundamentally.
A supernova, for example. I would love to know why massive stars explode in supernovae.
They are very useful. From them, we have learned much about the universe.
The fascinating physical processes, however, occur in the core, which is hidden beneath thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon, and silicon.
We will never see through them, as they are opaque.
Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were clear glass. The Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them, as the Big Bang is obscured by its own afterglow.
With the help of gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.
And perhaps most importantly: I am optimistic that in the universe there exist things we have never seen, that we likely never will see, and of which we have no conception whatsoever. Things that we can only discover by listening.
In fact, LIGO did indeed find things on its first try that we had not expected.
My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, a key member of the LIGO project, puts it this way: ME: The kind of stars that produce black holes, as observed by LIGO, are the dinosaurs of the universe.
They are massive, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. The black holes are, so to speak, the dinosaur bones for our archaeological work.
LIGO affords us an entirely different perspective on cosmic events, on the birth of stars, and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos.
AA: The challenge now is to be as bold as possible.
Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the hum and chirp of the cosmos.
We need ideas for new observatories - an entirely new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.
For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?
Now is the time for big dreams.
Dream with us.
Thank you.
