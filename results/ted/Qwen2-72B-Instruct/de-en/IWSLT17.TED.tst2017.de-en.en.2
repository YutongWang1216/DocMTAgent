This is the story of how I once nearly got kidnapped and ended up in the trunk of a red Mazda.
A day after completing my design studies, I had a yard sale.
A guy in the red Mazda stopped and checked out my stuff.
He bought one of my artworks.
He was alone in the city and was just taking a road trip across the country. Afterwards, he would join the Peace Corps.
I invited him for a beer. He enthusiastically told me about how he wanted to change the world.
It was getting late. I was getting tired.
While we were settling the bill, I made the mistake of asking him, "Where are you sleeping tonight?"
He made the whole situation even worse: "I don't know yet."
And I thought: "Oh, man!
What do I do now?
Who doesn't know the situation?
Do I have to offer a place to sleep now?
But I've just met him! He says he's going to join the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans to. I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazda!
This is a small trunk!
Then I heard myself say, "I have an air mattress. You can sleep in my living room."
A voice in my head said, "Uh, what?"
At night, I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, thinking: "Oh man! What have I gotten myself into?
A complete stranger is sleeping in my living room.
What if he's crazy?
I got so scared that I got out of bed, tiptoed to the door, and locked my bedroom door.
But he wasn't crazy at all.
We are still in touch.
The artwork he bought from me now hangs in his classroom. He is now a teacher.
That was my first experience as a host. It completely changed my perspective.
Maybe the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends just waiting to be discovered?
Hosting people on my air mattress became the norm for me. When I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress along.
Let's fast forward, two years later...
I'm unemployed, nearly broke, my roommate is moving out, and the rent is going up.
I found out that there was a design conference in town at the time. All the hotels were booked.
I believe creativity can turn fear into fun.
I wrote to my best friend and soon-to-be roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I've been thinking about how we could make some money. Our apartment is turning into a designer bed and breakfast. Young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and breakfast every morning.
Ha!"
We created a website and thus founded "Air Mattress and Breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].
Three happy guests got to sleep on the air mattress on our wooden floor for twenty dollars.
They loved it, and so did we.
I'm sure our cheese-ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.
We toured the entire city with them. When we said goodbye to our last guest and the door clicked shut, Brian and I stared at each other.
Had we just discovered that we could make new friends and pay our rent at the same time?
Things started to pick up.
My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.
We wanted to find out if this could be turned into a business concept.
This is how we presented ourselves to the investors: "We want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private spaces, their bedrooms, their bathrooms - the kind of rooms whose doors you close when company comes over.
Through the internet, they can then invite complete strangers to stay with them.
"This is going to be the next big thing!"
We were waiting for the rocket to ignite.
But she didn't.
No one in their right mind would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in other people's apartments.
Why?
Because we all learned as children that strangers can be dangerous.
When you have a problem, you fall back on what you're good at. We could design.
At art school, we learned that design is much more than just looks and feel -- it's the whole experience.
We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.
Can design do such a thing?
Is it possible to create trust with design?
I want to give you a taste of the level of trust we were aiming for.
It's a 30-second experiment. It will force you out of your comfort zone.
Raise your thumb if you're ready.
Take your mobile phone in your hand.
Now I would like you to unlock your phone.
Give your unlocked phone to your left neighbor.
This faint pang of panic you're feeling right now -- it's exactly what hosts feel when they open their door for the first time.
Because the only thing more personal than your phone is your home.
Visitors don't just read your text messages, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your bathroom.
How does it feel to hold an unlocked stranger's phone in your hands?
Most feel the responsibility.
Most guests also feel this way when they stay elsewhere.
Only for this reason can our company exist.
Just wondering, who has Al Gore's phone now?
Could you please announce on Twitter that he is running for the office of the President?
You can now return the phones.
You have now experienced the kind of trust we aim to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.
What if we had changed a small detail in this experiment?
What if your neighbor had first introduced himself by name; if he had told you where he was from, what his dog or his children are called?
Imagine having 150 reviews all saying, "He can really hold an unlocked phone well!"
How would you feel then, if you had to hand over your phone?
Because a well-designed feedback system significantly strengthens trust.
At the beginning, we still made some mistakes.
It was difficult for people to give negative reviews.
Ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their reviews before posting them online.
Last week we discovered something new.
We conducted a study with Stanford. We investigated how likely it is for people to trust each other, depending on how similar they are in terms of age and location.
Unsurprisingly, we trust people the most who are most similar to us.
The more differences we find, the less we trust.
This is a natural social bias.
Things get interesting when you add a person's reputation to the mix -- in our case, through reviews.
If you have fewer than three reviews, nothing changes.
But with more than ten, everything changes.
A good reputation highlights commonalities.
The right design can therefore help us overcome some of our deeply ingrained preferences.
We also learned that trust depends on how much one reveals about themselves.
Here you see the reactions to the first message from a guest.
If you share too little, like simply saying "Hi!", you're less likely to get a response.
If you share too much, like saying: "I have problems with my mother" -- the request is also less likely to be accepted.
There is therefore an optimal level of openness, for example, "Great artworks in your place! I'm vacationing with my family."
How can we use design to achieve this level of openness?
We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. We also provide tips on what topics one should write about.
Our entire company is built on the hope that the right design can help us overcome our prejudices against strangers.
What we hadn't anticipated was the large number of people who were more than willing to shed these prejudices.
Here you can see how many people are taking advantage of our offer.
One can observe three things.
Firstly: incredible amounts of luck.
Secondly: the tireless work of our team.
Thirdly: a need that had previously gone unmet.
Business is currently going very well for us.
Of course, there are also times when not everything runs smoothly.
There were guests who had thrown parties without permission or trashed apartments.
Hosts have left guests standing in the rain.
At the beginning of the project, I worked in customer service. All calls came directly to my mobile phone.
I was on the front line when trust was broken.
There is nothing worse than those calls. It still hurts just thinking about them.
The disappointment you hear in the callers' voices was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue improving.
Fortunately, of the 123 million mediated nights, only a fraction ever had an issue.
Because people rightly trusted each other.
When trust works, wonderful things can happen.
One of our guests was on vacation in Uruguay. There he suffered a heart attack.
His host drove him to the hospital.
He even donated blood for the necessary operation!
Here is his assessment:
"Perfect house for travelers prone to heart attacks due to sedentary jobs.
The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.
Javier and Alejandra are true guardian angels who save one's life even though they hardly know them.
They drive you to the hospital in their own car when you're dying, and wait while you get a bypass.
Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books over.
They even let you stay longer without charging for the extra nights.
"I can only recommend it!"
Of course, not every stay goes this smoothly.
But these relationships beyond mere monetary transactions are precisely what one aims to achieve with the sharing economy.
When I first stumbled upon this term, I wondered:
How does the idea of sharing fit with monetary transactions?
This is about an economic transaction.
But simply calling it the "rental industry" now doesn't do justice to what it is.
The sharing economy describes a trade that promises human connections.
People reveal a part of themselves, and that changes everything.
When you travel these days, it's akin to fast food. It's efficient and reliable, but less authentic as a result.
What if traveling was a rich buffet of local experiences?
What if, at every place you visit, there was a group of locals waiting to fill you in thoroughly and show you neighborhoods you've never heard of on a pub crawl;
or what if one could learn to cook from a five-star chef?
These days, apartments are designed with the principle of privacy in mind.
What if we designed apartments from the ground up to be shared?
What would that look like?
What if cities embraced the idea of shared ownership?
I envision cities that enable us to have companionship and relationships, instead of loneliness and isolation.
In South Korea's capital, Seoul, this project has already been initiated. Many parking lots, owned by the government,
were now offered to residents. Students who were looking for a place to stay,
were matched with people whose children had moved out. Incubator programs were launched,
to finance new startups in the sharing economy. Through our platform alone, 785,000 people will be staying with a stranger or hosting guests in 191 countries tonight.
The idea does not seem as crazy as we were taught it was.
We didn't reinvent the wheel.
Hospitality existed before as well.
Similar websites already existed before us.
Why did ours work, then?
Beyond luck and timing, we realized that one can find the right design with the components of trust.
Design can help us overcome deep-seated prejudices.
I find that astonishing,
truly overwhelming.
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me.
Of course, we know that design cannot solve every problem.
But if it could help us, if it had this huge impact, I wonder what we can use design for next.
Thank you.
