Alright, I want to tell a story, about how we come to know the things we know.
This is the story of this woman, Natalia Rachinskaya.
She was a paleontologist, and her specialty was digging up old things everywhere.
Natalia Rachinskaya: "Yes, some people call me Doctor Dead Stuff."
I found her particularly interesting because she dug up things in high-latitude Arctic regions, in the remote permafrost of Canada.
One day during the summer of 2006, she was at an archaeological dig site called the Fyles Leaf Bed, which is less than ten degrees of latitude from geomagnetic true north.
NR: "Honestly, it doesn't sound like much fun when you put it that way." "You spend all day carrying a pack, with a GPS unit and a notebook," "hiking over long distances, picking up anything that might be a fossil."
But at one point, she noticed something.
"A small, rust-colored object," about the size of my palm.
"It was just lying on the ground."
Her first thought was that it was just a piece of wood, because that's what people had found at the Fyles Leaf Bed before—prehistoric plant material.
But that evening, back at camp...
NR: "I took out my hand lens," 'I looked more closely, and I suddenly realized, "This thing doesn't seem to have growth rings."
"It could be a preservation issue," "but it really looks like..."
"Bones."
So over the next four years, she returned to the site again and again, eventually collecting 30 fragments, all from the same bone, many of them exceedingly small.
"It's not actually that much. It all fits into a small ziplock bag."
Then she tried to piece them together like a puzzle.
But it was extremely challenging.
"It had shattered into many tiny fragments," "and we tried to restore it using sand and putty, but it looked terrible."
"Finally, we used a 3D surface scanner."
"Oh wow! "Pretty cool, huh?"
In the end, it turned out that reconstructing it virtually was much simpler.
"When they all came together, it felt truly magical."
How confident are you that you've got it right, piecing it back together as it originally was?
Is it possible that if you pieced it together differently, you might end up with... a parrot or something?
"Well, no. We're pretty sure we've got it right."
She found that what she had pieced together was a tibia, or shinbone, and this tibia belonged to an even-toed ungulate mammal, the kind that includes creatures like cows and sheep.
But there was absolutely no way it could have been a cow or a sheep.
It was just too large.
"The size of this thing was just too big. This was a massive animal."
So what on earth could it have been?
Now hitting a roadblock, she showed one of the fragments to some colleagues in Colorado, and they had an idea.
"We used a little saw, and then we scraped a tiny bit off the edge of the fragment," "and from there came an incredibly distinctive smell."
It smelled somewhat like burned skin.
This was a scent Natalia recognized, one she had encountered while dissecting skulls in the gross anatomy lab—it was collagen.
Collagen is what gives our bones their rigidity.
In general, after so many years, it would naturally decompose.
However, in this case, the Arctic seemed to have acted as a natural deep-freeze, preserving it.
A year or two later, Natalia attended a major conference in Bristol, where she saw a colleague of hers, named Michael Buckley, demonstrating a new technique he called "collagen fingerprinting."
In fact, the collagen from different species has subtle structural variations, so if you have collagen information from an unknown bone, you can compare it to known species' collagen data, and who knows, maybe you'll find a match.
So she sent Mike a fragment by FedEx.
"Of course, you have to track the delivery closely. It's very important."
He processed the sample and compared it to 37 modern, known mammal species.
And it turned out there was a match!
The final conclusion was that the 3.5 million-year-old bone Natalia had discovered in the high Arctic, was from...
A camel.
"I thought, you've got to be kidding me," "But if we're right, it's amazing."
So they tested a bunch of fragments and got the same result for every single one.
However, judging by the size of the bone they found, this meant that this camel was 30 percent larger than a modern camel.
So this camel would have been roughly 2.7 meters tall and weighed about a ton.
"Oh, right."
Natalia discovered a "Giant Arctic Camel."
When you hear the word "camel," the image that comes to mind is likely that of the Bactrian camel, found in regions of East Asia and Central Asia.
But more likely, the image in your mind looks something like this: a dromedary camel, the quintessential desert creature, often found in scorching hot desert environments such as the Middle East or the Sahara, sporting a massive hump to store water for long treks across the desert, and broad hooves to help them navigate sand dunes.
So how on earth did these creatures end up in the high Arctic?
Scientists had actually known for some time, even before Natalia's discovery, that camels originated in the Americas.
( MUSIC: "The Star-Spangled Banner" ) They originated here.
For 40 million of the 45 million years that camels have existed, you could only find them in North America, with a total of 20 different species, possibly even more.
"If we lined them up, would they look different?"
"Yes, there was a huge range in body size."
"Some had particularly long necks," "so they functioned much like giraffes."
Some even had long snouts, similar to crocodiles.
"They were particularly primitive, and the earliest ones might have been very small," "almost like a little rabbit."
What? A camel the size of a rabbit?
"The earliest ones were indeed."
"You probably wouldn't recognize those."
My goodness, I wish I had a "rabbit-camel" as a pet!
"I know, right? This is going to be amazing, isn't it?"
Then, around 3 to 7 million years ago, one branch of camels migrated south into South America, where they evolved into llamas or alpacas, while another branch crossed the Bering Land Bridge into Asia and Africa.
At the end of the last ice age, camels in North America went completely extinct.
Scientists were already aware of this, but it doesn't fully account for how Natalia came to find a camel in such a northerly location.
Here, in terms of temperature, it's the complete antonym of the Sahara.
To be frank, 3.5 million years ago, the average temperatures were 22 degrees Celsius higher than they are today.
So it would have been a boreal forest up there, somewhat akin to the Yukon River basin or Siberia today.
However, they still had six-month-long winters, during which all the ponds would freeze over.
You will encounter blizzards.
You will experience 24 hours of continuous darkness.
Just... just what is going on?
How could these superstars of the Sahara possibly have survived under such frigid conditions?
Natalia and her colleagues felt they had found the answer.
And the answer was rather ingenious.
What if the characteristics of camels, which we don't think were adaptations for the Sahara-like environment, were actually evolved to survive harsh winters?
What if those broad feet weren't for crossing sand dunes, but instead, like snowshoes, for traversing snowy landscapes?
What if those humps — what a scoop! — stored not water, but fat, enabling camels to survive the food-scarce, six-month-long winter cold?
What if, long after that, they modified these winter-adapted traits into adaptations for hot desert conditions upon crossing land bridges?
For instance, those humps might be beneficial to camels in hot climates because when you store your fat in one place, you know, like a "fat backpack," it means your insulating layer doesn't have to cover your entire body.
This makes it easier for them to dissipate heat.
It was this crazy idea that suddenly transformed what appeared to be classic desert traits in camels into evidence that they originated in the high latitudes of the Arctic.
Actually, I'm not the first person to tell this story.
Others have already told it, marveling at the wonders of biological evolution, or offering a glimpse into potential future scenarios of climate change.
But I love this story for another, different reason.
For me, this is a story about us, about how we perceive the world, and how that perception can change.
My profession is that of a historian.
I've found that, in fact, many scientists are also historians.
They figure out what happened in the past.
They tell the history of the universe, the Earth, and its living beings.
As a historian, you need to have a narrative in your mind, considering how the story unfolds.
"We spin tales, and then we follow the narrative," "just like the desert-dwelling camels, right?"
"What an awesome story! Camels are just perfectly suited for the desert."
"It turns out that camels have always lived there."
But at any time, you might come across tiny clues.
You might find little things that force you to reshape everything you thought you knew.
Just like in this case, where one scientist found a shard she thought was wood, this discovery led to a new, counterintuitive theory in science, explaining why this odd, furry creature evolved into its current form.
To me, this completely upended my understanding of camels.
It transforms from a creature seemingly specialized for a singular environment into a globe-trotting traveler, one that just happens to show up in the Sahara Desert, but could potentially turn up anywhere.
This is Azulie.
Hey, Azulie! How are you?
Come, I've brought you something to eat.
Azulie had just finished her guest performance, coming over from New York's Radio City Music Hall.
This isn't a joke.
Well, whatever... Seriously, Azulie is here as a living testament to how the story of the world is ever-changing.
We need to take the initiative, to boldly make changes and reimagine.
Azulie, you agree, don't you?
Indeed, we are only a fragment of bone away from a completely new perspective on how we view the world.
Thank you all.
