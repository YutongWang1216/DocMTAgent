Hello everyone.
My name is Matthew Williams, and I am a champion.
I have won medals in three different sports and at the Canada Games. I have played basketball at the international level, and I am extremely proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I train in basketball and speed skating with top-notch coaches and sports psychologists five days a week to maintain peak performance.
By the way, all of this is thanks to the Special Olympics.
Has this changed your perception of me and my accomplishments at all?
The world doesn't see everyone like me as a champion.
Not long ago, people like me were not accepted.
Since the inception of the Special Olympics in 1968, there has been significant improvement, but in reality, it's still common to see that people with intellectual disabilities are often overlooked compared to those without such challenges.
People call me "stupid" to my face, assuming I wouldn't care.
They call me "idiot," saying I'm slow, using it entirely in a derogatory manner.
They have no idea how much this hurts me and my friends.
I don't want you to think that I'm here seeking pity.
I am here because the issue persists: There are still many people who have misconceptions about how they perceive individuals with intellectual disabilities, or, even more concerning, many simply fail to acknowledge their existence at all.
Do you all know that the World Games are being held this year?
I am one of the 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities, coming from 165 countries, competing in Los Angeles.
At the time, there were over 62,000 spectators watching the opening ceremony, and it was even broadcast live by TSN and ESPN.
But do you know about this?
When you see someone like me, what do you think?
I am here today to boldly advocate for our equal recognition.
The Special Olympics has transformed the self-perception of athletes with intellectual disabilities, as well as shifted the perspectives of spectators.
If you're unfamiliar with the Special Olympics, let me explain: it's a program designed for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
It operates independently of the Paralympics and the Olympics.
We have high-quality, year-round sports programs specifically for athletes with intellectual disabilities, which can transform our destinies and alter perceptions about us.
The Special Olympics has changed my life, it has changed the lives of many others, and it has also transformed how the world views individuals with intellectual disabilities.
I was born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability.
Before I was 12, I played hockey all the time.
The older I get, the harder it feels to keep up with others, and I feel angry and frustrated.
There was a time when I wasn't involved in any sports, didn't have many friends, and felt abandoned and ignored.
There was a time when individuals with intellectual disabilities were isolated from society, hidden away from public view.
No one would think they could participate in sports, let alone become valuable members of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the impact of regular physical activity on the health of children with intellectual disabilities.
Dr. Hayden and other researchers, through rigorous scientific study, reached a conclusion: The reason for the diminished health of children with intellectual disabilities was simply a lack of opportunities for physical activity.
Many people doubt that individuals with intellectual disabilities can benefit from sports programs or athletic competition.
But it was thanks to people like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of the Special Olympics, who believed in the benefits of sports, that these have been proven time and again by no fewer than 4.5 million Special Olympics athletes.
Before I joined the Special Olympics, I was a nervous person, young and shy with little confidence and not many friends.
But when I got there, I found everyone to be friendly, supportive, and non-judgmental, allowing me to just be myself.
Now, I am a basketball player and a speed skater, having competed at provincial and national levels. This year, I participated in the Special Olympics Summer Games in Los Angeles, where I had the honor of representing Team Canada as one of the inaugural basketball players to compete on the world stage.
I am one among the 4.5 million athletes worldwide, and I have heard many similar stories.
Becoming athletes in the Special Olympics helps us regain confidence and dignity.
This event also highlights significant health needs.
Studies show that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities live 13 years less than men without such disabilities, and women with intellectual disabilities live 20 years less than women without them.
The Special Olympics keeps us healthy and actively engaged in sports.
Our coaches also teach us about nutrition and wellness.
The Special Olympics also offers free health screenings to athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctors or accessing healthcare.
At the 2015 Special Olympics Summer Games, my teammates from Team Canada and I went up against the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the game, members of the Nigerian basketball team underwent health examinations through the Games' health system. Seven out of the ten players received free hearing aids, hearing more clearly for the first time in their lives.
The changes it brings about are remarkable.
They were more excited, happier, and confident because their coach could finally communicate with them using words.
They were easily exhilarated because they could now hear the sounds of the basketball, the whistle, and the cheers of fans standing nearby, sounds we often take for granted.
The Special Olympics does not merely transform its athletes in terms of athletics.
It also transforms them in aspects of their personal lives.
This year, studies show that nearly half of American adults do not know a single person with an intellectual disability, and 44% of Americans who have had no contact with people with intellectual disabilities are significantly less tolerant and hold less positive attitudes.
Then, words tinged with the term "fool" demonstrate that individuals with intellectual disabilities continue to be overlooked and feel isolated from the world.
People use this word either casually or as an insult.
Last year on Twitter, it was used more than nine million times, deeply hurting me and my 4.5 million fellow athletes around the world.
People don't realize they're using it as an insult, but that's exactly what it is.
My fellow athlete and Global Messenger, Franklin Stevens, wrote a letter to a political commentator who had used the "r-word" as an insult, saying, "Come watch the Special Olympics one day,
See if you leave with the same opinion."
This year, at the 2015 Special Olympics Summer Games, people waited in line for hours just to see the final night of weightlifting competitions.
When my teammate Jackie Barrett took the stage, the crowd rose to their feet; known as the Newfoundland Moose, he deadlifted 665 pounds and squatted 611 pounds, setting multiple new records for the Special Olympics.
Jackie is a record holder among weightlifters in Newfoundland, not just within the Special Olympics, but among all weightlifters.
Jackie is now a big celebrity in Los Angeles, with ESPN even tweeting live about his weightlifting record-breaking performance, expressing astonishment at his feats.
Fifty years ago, few could have imagined what people with intellectual disabilities were capable of achieving.
This year, sixty thousand spectators filled the iconic Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to witness the opening ceremony of the games and cheer on athletes from 165 countries around the world.
We were celebrated and cheered on, no longer hidden away.
The Special Olympics teaches athletes to be more confident and proud of themselves.
The Special Olympics also teaches the world that individuals with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and inclusion.
Now, in my athletic career, I have dreams and achievements, quality training, respect, and a healthier lifestyle, and I'm also working towards becoming a personal trainer.
I am no longer hidden or bullied; I am here at TED giving a TED Talk.
With the Special Olympics, the world has changed, but there is still a long way to go.
So the next time you see someone with an intellectual disability, I hope you can see their potential.
The next time someone uses the word "stupid" around you, I hope you tell them how hurtful it can be.
I hope you will want to watch a Special Olympics event.
I want to leave you with one final thought.
Nelson Mandela once said, "Sport has the power to change the world."
The Special Olympics is changing the world, transforming the lives of 4.5 million athletes, giving us a place where we can gain confidence, make friends, avoid discrimination, and experience what it's like to be a champion.
Thank you all!
