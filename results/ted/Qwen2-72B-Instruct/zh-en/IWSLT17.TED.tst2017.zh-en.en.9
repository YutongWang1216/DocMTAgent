Okay, I want everyone to raise their hands if you've ever blocked a friend on Facebook because they made inappropriate comments about politics, religion, children's rights, or food.
How many people have at least one person they don't want to see, simply because you don't want to talk to them?
Remember, in times past, if we wanted to have a polite conversation, we just followed Henry Higgins' advice in "My Fair Lady": stick to the weather and your health.
But in recent years, with climate change and the anti-vaccination movement, that tactic doesn't work so well anymore.
So in this world that we live in, where every conversation can turn into an argument, where politicians can't talk to each other, and where there are people who are passionately for or against anything and everything, something is out of whack.
The Pew Research Center surveyed ten thousand American adults and found that our levels of polarization and the intensity of our positions are higher than at any point in history.
We are less inclined to compromise, which means that we are not listening to one another.
The decisions we make, about where to live, whom to marry, or even who to be friends with, are increasingly based on our existing beliefs.
Again, this indicates that we are not listening to one another.
Conversation requires a balance between speaking and listening, and somehow, we have lost that balance.
Advances in technology are part of the reason.
Take the smartphones, which are now in your hands or within easy reach nearby.
According to Pew's research, roughly one-third of American teenagers send more than a hundred text messages per day.
And among these people, almost all of them, prefer to text their friends rather than talk to them face-to-face.
The Atlantic published a great article,
The author is Paul Barnwell, a high school teacher.
He gave his students a communication assignment,
He hoped to teach them how to give a presentation on a topic without relying on notes.
Then he said, "I began to realize..."
"I began to realize that communication skills are perhaps the most neglected, and poorly taught, skills we have."
Children spend hours each day engaging with screens for creativity and connecting with peers, but have few opportunities to develop their interpersonal skills."
It may sound amusing, but we must ask ourselves: In the 21st century, what skill could be more important than maintaining a coherent, confident conversation?
Now, my job is to have conversations with people. Nobel laureates, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, governors, plumbers.
I converse with people I like, and also with those I don't.
I converse with people I profoundly disagree with on a personal level.
But I still manage to have good conversations with them.
So I'd like to spend the next ten minutes teaching you how to talk, and how to listen.
Many of you have likely heard countless tips, such as making eye contact, having interesting topics prepared for discussion, maintaining focus through gazing, nodding, and smiling to show attentiveness, and repeating or summarizing what you've just heard.
I want you to forget all of those.
None of it is useful.
There's no need to learn how to appear attentive if you genuinely are.
I've actually taken the same skills that I use as a professional interviewer and applied them to everyday life.
Alright, I'm going to teach you how to interview people, which will actually help you learn how to be better communicators.
Learning to start a conversation, without wasting time, without being boring, and most importantly, without offending anyone.
We've all had great conversations.
We've all been there. We know what it feels like.
Those conversations that leave you feeling truly engaged, inspired, or as if you've formed a genuine connection with someone, or felt completely understood by another person.
There's no reason why most of your interactions can't be like that.
I have ten basic rules. I'll explain each one, but honestly, if you choose just one and master it, you'll already be enjoying more rewarding conversations.
Rule number one: Don't be half-hearted.
I'm not saying just put down your cell phone, or your iPad, or your car keys, or whatever is in your hand.
What I mean is, be present.
Immerse yourself in the situation.
Don't think about your previous argument with your boss.
Don't think about what you're having for dinner.
If you want to withdraw from the conversation, then withdraw. But don't be physically present while mentally checked out.
Rule number two: Don't be a know-it-all.
If you want to express your opinion without leaving any room for response, argument, rebuttal, or elaboration, go write a blog post.
There's a good reason why I don't allow "expert lecturing" in my conversations: it's really boring.
If the person is a conservative, they surely dislike Obama, food stamps, and abortion.
If the person is a liberal, they surely dislike big banks, oil companies, and Dick Cheney.
Entirely predictable.
You certainly don't want that.
You need to approach every interaction assuming there's something you can learn.
The renowned therapist M. Scott Peck once said that true listening requires setting aside your own agenda.
Sometimes, this means setting aside your personal opinions.
He says that feeling this acceptance, the speaker becomes increasingly less fragile, and thus more likely to open up their inner world to the listener.
Reiterate the point that you should assume you have something new to learn.
Bill Nye said, "Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't."
Let me reiterate: Everyone is an expert in something.
Third: Use open-ended questions.
On this point, consider how journalists formulate their questions when interviewing subjects.
Ask questions that begin with "who," "what," "when," "where," "why," or "how."
If you ask a complex question, you will receive a simple answer.
If I were to ask you, "Were you afraid at the time?"
You would respond to the most powerful word in that question, which is "fear," and the answer would be "yes" or "no."
"If I were to ask you, 'Were you angry at the time?' The answer would be, 'Yes, I was very angry then.'"
Let the other person do the describing, as they are the one who knows the situation.
Try asking the other person: "What was it like?"
"How did you feel about it?"
By doing so, the other person may need to pause and think, resulting in more interesting responses for you.
Fourth: Go with the flow.
This means that ideas will naturally flow into your mind, and you need to express them.
We often see in interviews where a guest speaks for several minutes, only for the host to ask a question that seems to come out of nowhere or has already been answered.
This suggests that the host may have stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this incredibly clever question and became fixated on asking it.
We do the same thing as well.
When we sit down to talk with someone, we suddenly remember that time we bumped into Hugh Jackman at a coffee shop.
And then we stop listening.
Stories and ideas will continually come to you,
But even if you can't stop them, don't let them linger too long in your mind.
Fifth: If you don't know, say you don't know.
People on the radio, especially on National Public Radio, are very aware that their words will be broadcast. Therefore, they are more careful about what they claim expertise in and the assertions they make.
Learn to do this. Speak and act with caution.
Conversation should be a responsible act.
Sixth: Avoid comparing your experiences to others'.
If the other person is talking about losing a family member, don't take it as an opening to start talking about how you lost a family member.
If the other person is talking about work-related troubles, don't tell them how much you hate your job.
This is different, it can never be the same.
Every experience is unique.
And, more importantly, this isn't about you.
You don't need to prove at this moment how competent you are, or how much pain you've endured.
When someone once asked Stephen Hawking what his IQ was, he replied, "I don't know. People who boast about their IQ are losers."
Conversation is not a means for self-promotion.
Seventh: Try not to repeat yourself.
This is aggressive and boring, but we do it easily.
Especially in work conversations, or when talking to our children. We want to make a point, so we keep saying it in different ways.
Don't do that.
Eighth: Minimize small talk.
Let's be honest, no one cares about those years, names, dates, and all the details you're trying so hard to recall from your memory.
Others don't care. They are focused on you.
The other person is interested in who you are and what you have in common.
So forget the details. Let them go.
Ninth: This is not the last guideline, but it is the most important one.
Listen attentively.
I couldn't tell you how many distinguished people have said that listening may be the single most important, the number one skill you can improve upon.
As the Buddha said - let me paraphrase, "If you keep talking, you won't learn anything."
Calvin Coolidge once said, "No one was ever fired for listening too much."
Why are we unwilling to listen to each other?
Firstly, we prefer to speak.
When I am speaking, everything is under my control.
I don't have to listen to anything that doesn't interest me.
I am the focus.
I can reinforce my own sense of identity.
But there's another reason: We get distracted.
The average person speaks at a rate of about 225 words per minute, but we can listen to nearly 500 words per minute.
So our minds are occupied by these extra 275 words.
I know it's exhausting to really pay attention to someone talking, but if you don't, you're not having a conversation.
You're just two people in the same place yelling unrelated things at each other.
You must listen to each other.
Stephen Covey has a brilliant take on this.
He said, "Most of us do not listen with the intent to understand.
We listen in order to respond."
The last one, number ten: Be brief and to the point.
"A good conversation should be like a well-cut miniskirt; short enough to be alluring, yet long enough to cover the subject," as my sister would put it. All this boils down to one idea: being interested in others.
I grew up around a famous grandfather, with a constant stream of guests in our home.
Visitors would come to converse with my grandparents, and after they left, my mother would come over and say to us, "Do you know who that was?
She was the first runner-up for Miss America.
He is the mayor of Sacramento.
She is a Pulitzer Prize winner. He is a Russian ballet dancer.
I grew up assuming that everyone has an amazing story that's unknown.
In all seriousness, I think it's all of this that made me a better interviewer.
I try to speak less, but open my mind, always ready for amazement, and I'm never disappointed.
You can do this too.
Go out, talk to people, listen to them, and most importantly, be ready for amazement.
Thank you.
