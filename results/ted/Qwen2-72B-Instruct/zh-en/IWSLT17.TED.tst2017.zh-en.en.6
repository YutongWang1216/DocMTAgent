There are times when I feel deeply ashamed to be a European.
Last year, over a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help, and our response, frankly, has been pathetic.
There are too many contradictions here.
We mourned the death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi, yet since then, over two hundred children have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea one after another.
We have international conventions recognizing that the responsibility for receiving refugees is shared by all countries, yet we accept that tiny Lebanon hosts more Syrians than the whole of Europe does.
We denounce the existence of human trafficking, yet we make it the only viable route for seeking asylum in Europe.
We face labor shortages, yet we prevent those who could meet our economic and demographic needs from entering Europe.
We claim that our liberal values are the opposite of those espoused by Islamic fundamentalists, yet – we subject child asylum seekers to detention under duress, separate children from their families, and confiscate refugees’ belongings.
What are we doing?
How did we get here, responding to a humanitarian crisis in such an inhumane way?
I do not believe that it is because people do not care – at least, I refuse to believe that.
I believe that it is because our political leaders lack vision – specifically, vision about how to adapt institutions crafted five decades ago to cope with an evolving and globalizing world.
The international refugee system. So what I would like to do is take a step back and pose two very fundamental questions – questions that all of us need to confront.
First, why does the existing system fail?
Second, how can we fix it?
The modern refugee system was created in the wake of World War II by these individuals.
Its purpose was to ensure that when a country breaks down, or worse, a regime turns against its own people, those people have somewhere to go where they can live safely and with dignity until they can return home.
This is precisely what we see today in Syria.
Through an international conference endorsed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and an international organization, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), countries pledged to one another to allow non-nationals onto their territory who are fleeing war, conflict, and persecution.
But now, that system is breaking down.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In reality, our immigration policies block the path to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to be treated equally or to choose to return to their home country.
But in practice, they are trapped in a state of virtually indefinite limbo.
In theory, the refugee challenge is one that all countries share.
In reality, geography means that countries neighboring conflicts receive the lion's share of refugees, often beyond their capacity.
The flaws in the existing refugee system are not what is causing it to break down.
It is because we have failed to apply them sufficiently as the world has changed – precisely what we need to reconsider.
So let me explain how the current system is supposed to work.
How does the current refugee reception system operate?
But this is not a top-down macro view; it is a view from the perspective of the individual refugee.
So, imagine a Syrian woman.
Let's call her Amira.
Amira represents the many refugees I have met in the region.
Amira, like roughly a quarter of the world's refugees, is a woman with children who cannot go home because her city – Homs, which you see here – was once a beautiful, historic place, now lies in ruins.
So Amira cannot go back.
Amira also has no hope of being resettled in a third country, because that is akin to winning the lottery: fewer than one percent of the world's refugees ever get that chance.
So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice.
They have three basic options.
The first is that Amira can take her family to a refugee camp.
In the refugee camp, she may receive aid, but for Amira and her family, the prospects are exceedingly dim.
The camp is situated in barren, desolate lands, typically in the midst of a desert.
In Jordan's Zaatari camp, you can hear the shells crossing the border from Syria at night.
Economic activities there are severely restricted.
The quality of education is typically very low.
And around the world, some 80% of refugees in camps must remain there for at least five years.
These are miserable places, which may explain why, in reality, only 9% of Syrians have chosen this option.
Or Amira could head for an urban area in a neighboring country, such as Amman or Beirut.
Seventy-five percent of Syrian refugees choose this option.
But even there, the challenges are formidable.
Refugees in urban areas typically lack the right to work.
They typically lack access to aid.
So when Amira and her family exhaust their meager savings, they will have little to fall back on, and poverty beckons.
And there is a third option, which an increasing number of Syrians are choosing.
Amira can seek hope for her family by embarking on a perilous journey that may cost them their lives, bound for another country – this is what we see playing out in Europe today.
Globally, we are leaving refugees with an almost impossible choice: between the three options of camps, urban destitution, and a perilous journey.
For refugees, this choice is the global refugee regime today.
But I believe this is a mistaken choice.
I believe that we can revisit this choice.
The reason we limit these options is that we assume they are the only ones available to refugees – but they are not.
Politicians frame it as a zero-sum game: if refugees gain, citizens must lose.
We seem to accept the assumption that refugees are an inevitable burden and expense to society.
But this is not a given; refugees can contribute.
So what I want to argue is that we have a way to expand those options, and make them beneficial for everyone involved: the receiving countries and communities, our societies, and the refugees themselves.
I want to propose four ways to transform our established thinking about refugees.
These four approaches share a common thread: we are harnessing the opportunities presented by globalization, social mobility, and markets to refresh our understanding of the refugee challenge.
I want to start by considering the notion of creating environments, which stems from a fundamental recognition that refugees, like everyone else, are simply people in specific circumstances.
My colleagues at Oxford University and I have launched a research project in Uganda to study the economic lives of refugees.
We chose Uganda not because it is a typical case among host countries.
It is rather an exception.
Unlike most host countries around the world, what Uganda does is provide refugees with economic opportunities.
Giving them the right to work and the freedom to move.
The results have been remarkable, for both the refugees and the host countries.
In Uganda's capital, Kampala, we found that 21% of refugees start companies and run their own businesses, employing others; 40% of those employed are nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees are creating jobs for host-country citizens.
Even in refugee camps, we found examples of dynamic, thriving entrepreneurial activity.
For example, in a camp called Nakivale, we found Congolese refugees running a business trading in digital music.
We found Rwandan refugees operating businesses that enable young people to play computer games on recycled consoles and screens.
Breaking through extreme constraints, refugees are innovating constantly. Before you is a Congolese man named Damon Kay.
He arrived at the refugee camp with nothing but a dream to become a filmmaker.
So together with friends and fellow refugees, he started a community radio station. He rented a camera, and he is now making films.
He has already shot two documentaries, working with our team and for our team, and starting with almost no resources, he has built a successful career.
It is precisely these kinds of examples that should guide our response to refugees.
Rather than seeing refugees as inevitably dependent on humanitarian aid, we need to give them the opportunity to pursue human flourishing.
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, and food are critically important during the emergency phase, but we must also think long-term.
We need to provide internet connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, capital, and business networks.
All the avenues to the global economy that we take for granted should be – and can be – made available to refugees.
The second idea I want to discuss is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world have adopted Uganda's policies.
Most host countries' economies remain closed to refugees, but we do have workable alternatives.
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, development economist Paul Collier, to discuss an idea with the international community and local authorities: creating jobs for Syrians while advancing Jordan's national development strategy.
The idea was to establish an economic zone where we could combine employment for refugees with that of Jordanians, the host country's citizens.
Just a 15-minute drive outside the Zaatari refugee camp, home to 83,000 refugees, there exists a functioning economic zone known as the King Hussein Economic Zone.
The government has invested over $100 million to connect the power grid and roads, but two things are still missing: labor and foreign investment.
What if refugees could work there instead of being confined to camps, support their families until they can return to Syria, and develop skills through vocational training?
We recognized that this would benefit Jordan, which, as a middle-income country, needs to upgrade its manufacturing sector as part of its national development strategy.
Doing so would benefit the refugees while also aiding Syria’s post-conflict reconstruction, by recognizing that they need to be empowered as a key resource for that effort.
We published this perspective in the journal Foreign Affairs.
King Abdullah of Jordan also embraced this idea.
Two weeks ago, at the London conference on Syria, a pilot project based on this idea was announced, and it will begin this summer.
The third idea I want to present is preference matching between states and refugees, in order to achieve the kind of satisfactory outcome seen in this selfie, which features German Chancellor Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee.
We rarely ask refugees what they want or where they would like to go, but I argue that we should – and that doing so would benefit everyone.
Economist Alvin Roth developed the concept of matching markets, in which the final matches are determined by the ordinal preferences of both sides.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Tawbein have explored how to apply this concept to the refugee challenge, asking refugees to rank the countries to which they would prefer to go, while also allowing states to rank the types of refugees they wish to receive based on criteria such as skills or language. The two rankings are then matched.
Of course, you would need to establish quotas for diversity and vulnerability, but this is a way to increase the likelihood of successful matches.
This matching concept has already proven successful in, for example, pairing students with universities and kidney donors with patients, and it also highlights the importance of algorithms in dating websites.
So why not apply it to offer better options for refugees?
This can also be applied at the country level, where the biggest challenge is persuading local communities to accept refugees.
Currently, taking my country as an example, we often send engineers to remote areas and farmers into cities, which makes no sense at all.
So matching markets offer a potential way to align these preferences, reflecting the needs and demands of both the people of the host country and the refugees.
My fourth idea is humanitarian visas.
Most of the tragedies and chaos that we see in Europe are entirely avoidable.
This stems from a fundamental contradiction at the heart of Europe's asylum policy: In order to seek asylum in Europe, you have to get yourself there, embarking on the perilous journey I described earlier. But why is such a journey necessary?
In an era of budget airlines and consulates?
These are entirely unnecessary journeys that led to more than 3,000 deaths last year, at Europe's borders and inside the continent.
If refugees could go directly to Europe and claim asylum, these deaths could be avoided. And this is doable, through humanitarian visas, which would allow people to obtain a visa at an embassy or consulate in neighboring countries, and then pay their own way to Europe by cruise ship or plane.
It costs roughly €1,000 to smuggle a person from Turkey to the Greek islands.
It would cost just €200 to fly on a budget airline from Bodrum, Turkey, to Frankfurt, Germany.
If we allowed them to do so, it would yield tremendous benefits.
This would save lives, eliminate the market for smuggling, and end the chaos that we see on Europe's periphery, in places like the Greek islands.
What stands in the way of implementing this solution is politics, not a lack of rational alternatives.
And this is an idea that has already been put into practice.
Brazil pioneered this policy, with more than 2,000 Syrians obtaining humanitarian visas to enter Brazil, where they were granted refugee status upon arrival.
In that program, each Syrian was granted refugee status and confirmed as a genuine refugee.
There is also a historical precedent
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports served as travel documents, allowing 450,000 Assyrians, Turks, and Chechens to cross into Europe and apply for refugee status elsewhere on the continent.
The Nansen International Office for Refugees was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for this workable solution.
So the four ideas I have shown you are all ways in which we can increase Amira's options.
Allowing refugees better options, not limited to the three fundamental, unviable choices I mentioned earlier, and still benefiting everyone.
In summary, we need a new perspective to expand refugees' options, while recognizing that they are not necessarily a burden on society.
Refugees being a cost is not a given.
Indeed, refugees are our humanitarian responsibility, but they are also people with skills, talents, and aspirations, capable of contributing to society - if we allow them to.
In a new world, migration will not go away.
The scene we see in Europe will be with us for many years to come.
People will continue to migrate; people will continue to leave their homes. We need to find a rational and realistic way to manage this – not based on the old logic of humanitarian assistance, not based on the logic of charity, but on the opportunities presented by globalization, markets, and mobility.
I hope that everyone recognizes this, and I urge our government officials to rise to the challenge.
Thank you everyone.
