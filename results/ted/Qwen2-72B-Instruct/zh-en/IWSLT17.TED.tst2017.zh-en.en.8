When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the heart of Zimbabwe’s national health policy.
Upon taking power after a protracted war of independence, the new government promptly unveiled a socialist program that made primary health care and elementary education virtually free.
A vast network of rural health clinics put 80% of the population within two hours’ walk of care – a truly remarkable achievement.
In 1980, the year of Zimbabwe's independence, 25% of children were routinely immunized.
By 1990, just ten years later, that figure had risen to 80%.
It was a privilege to be part of that transformation, that revolution.
The excitement and camaraderie were palpably real.
Working side by side with the remarkable people of Zimbabwe – scientists, doctors, and activists – I felt that I was not just participating in an African independence movement, but in a progressive global public-health movement as well.
I have also faced daunting challenges.
In 1985, the year I arrived, Zimbabwe reported its first case of AIDS.
In the early 1980s, I cared for some of the first patients with AIDS while I was training in medicine at Harlem Hospital. But... we had no idea what we were going to encounter in Africa.
When I first arrived, the infection rate was around 2%.
By the time I left Harare 17 years later, one in every four adults was infected.
By the mid-1990s, I was telling hundreds of vibrant young people that they had tested positive for HIV.
I watched colleagues and friends die, as did my students and hospital patients.
Faced with this situation, my colleagues and I started a clinic.
We demonstrated how to use condoms.
We conducted outreach in schools, workplaces, and communities.
We conducted research, and we provided advice on how to protect themselves to the partners of people living with AIDS.
We worked very hard at all of this, and I believe that I gave it everything I had at the time.
I provided the best care possible, given the circumstances at the time.
But I did not make constructive changes.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan once candidly admitted that his personal mistakes led to the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was the head of the UN peacekeeping department.
At the genocide's tenth-anniversary commemoration, he recalled that at the time, he believed he had done everything he could, but in the aftermath of the genocide, he realized there was much more he could and should have done to sound the alarm and seek support.
The explosion of AIDS caught the medical community off guard, with the World Health Organization estimating that thirty-nine million people have died from the disease to date. Many, like me, feel regret and sorrow for not having done more to stop it sooner.
But when I lived in Zimbabwe, I did not think of myself as an advocate or a political person.
I had assumed I was going there because of my medical expertise, because of my clinical and infectious disease training.
I always felt that my job was to care for patients and, through research, better understand the epidemiology of the infection, hoping to slow its spread.
I became aware of the disproportionately high numbers of marginalized communities being infected and dying from AIDS.
In the sugar estates, which resembled feudal fiefdoms more than modern businesses, 60% of pregnant women were testing positive for HIV.
My work involved showing that infection was not a matter of moral failing, but rather was linked to patriarchy, to the coercion of migrant labor, and to colonialism.
The white people mostly remained unscathed.
As medical professionals, our arsenal was disappointingly limited: we appealed to people to change their personal behavior, to use condoms, and to reduce the number of sexual partners.
Infection rates continued to climb. Treatment, which should have been our most effective weapon against the virus, was feasible in the West but remained unaffordable for the entire public sector in Africa.
I did not boldly articulate that inequalities in access to life-saving medicines or flaws in the underlying economic and political systems were driving factors behind the high prevalence of infection among such a large segment of the population.
I rationalized my silence, reminding myself that I was a guest in this country and that sounding the alarm might get me expelled, preventing me from doing the work I needed to do – caring for my patients and conducting the desperately needed research.
So I did not boldly speak out about the government's early HIV policies.
I did not voice my concerns loudly enough.
Many doctors and health workers might feel that I didn't do anything wrong.
Our commitment to our patients, akin to the Hippocratic Oath and its various iterations, is sacrosanct within the doctor-patient relationship.
I did everything in my power for each of my patients.
But I knew that the infectious diseases that accompanied our fractured society reflected more than just biological phenomena; they were crucially indicative of marginalization, exclusion, racism, sexism, and classism.
So it was with AIDS.
So it was with Ebola.
Medical anthropologists, such as Paul Farmer working on AIDS in Haiti, term this structural violence: structural, because inequality is rooted in the political and economic organization of our social environments, often ignored by those in positions of privilege and power; violent, because its effects – premature death, suffering, illness – are indeed violent.
We do little for patients if we fail to recognize these social injustices.
Sounding the alarm is the first step toward steering public health in the right direction, it's how we seek support, how we break through together to effect real change.
So today, I am not staying silent.
I have spoken out boldly on many issues, despite discomforting my audience, and despite discomforting myself.
Much of this pertains to apartheid and organized racism, things that should not happen in this country, things that should not exist within medical practice or public health.
But they do exist, and we pay for them with shortened lives.
That's why I've sounded the alarm about how racism impacts health in America—the persistent, organized, interpersonal violence against people of color is inextricably linked to our tragic history of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow, and 60 years of inadequate equality. Doing so has been a central part of my work as New York City's Health Commissioner.
In New York City, the premature mortality rate – death before age 65 – is 50% higher for black people than for white people.
In 2012, Black women faced more than ten times the risk of pregnancy-related death compared to White women.
Despite significant progress in reducing infant mortality, the death rate for black infants in their first year of life remains nearly three times that of white infants.
New York City is no exception.
These statistics are similarly reflected across the entire United States.
A recent New York Times analysis reports that there are roughly 15 million missing black men nationwide.
The author points out that among Black men aged 25 to 54, at least one in six has vanished from daily life, either due to incarceration or premature death.
Young black people confront disproportionate levels of violence on a daily basis, an injustice that resonates in the recent protests bearing signs that read "Black Lives Matter."
But we must remember that in the status quo of general healthcare and its outcomes, along with persistently high rates of diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and AIDS—those that silently and slowly claim lives—there are diseases that take more Black lives prematurely.
As the Black Lives Matter movement unfolded, I felt frustrated and angry that the medical establishment, in its research and practice, remained hesitant even to use the term "racism."
Every time I say it, you probably sense it already.
Medical students dressed in white coats protested against biological weapons, but the medical establishment largely stood by as ongoing racism influenced disease patterns and mortality rates.
I worry that the trend toward personalized and precision medicine, seeking out biological and genetic targets to better design therapies, might inadvertently blind us to the big picture—the lived reality where people live, grow, work, and love, which profoundly influences population health and, for many, ill health.
In our daily lives, as health care workers, whether in clinics or conducting research, we bear witness to monumental injustices: the homeless person who cannot adhere to medical instructions because they must prioritize more immediate needs; the young transgender individual contemplating suicide due to a society that is too unforgiving; the single mother who feels compelled to shoulder the blame for her child's poor health.
As health care workers, our role is not just to treat our patients, but also to sound the alarm and advocate for change.
Regardless of whether it is deserved, our professional standing lends credibility to our voices, and we should not squander this privilege.
I regret not being more outspoken in Zimbabwe, and I have made a commitment to myself that as New York City's Health Commissioner, I will seize every opportunity available to sound the alarm and advocate for health equity.
I will speak out against racism, and I hope you will join me, just as I will stand with you when you speak out against sexism or any form of inequality.
It's time for us to rise up together and speak out boldly against structural inequalities.
We do not need to have all the answers to advocate for change.
We just need courage.
The health of our patients, and indeed our own health, depends on it.
