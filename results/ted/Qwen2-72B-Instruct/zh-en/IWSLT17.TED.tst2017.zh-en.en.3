When I was in college, I studied political science, which meant I had to write a lot of papers.
When an average student writes a paper, they might do so by spreading out the task like this.
So, you see, it might start off a bit slow, but after a week, you've already written quite a bit, then sometimes you write a bit more, and finally, everything is done and nothing goes wrong.
I wish it were that way for me too.
At least, that's how my plan goes.
I'm all ready to start, yet when it comes down to actually writing the paper, this is what happens.
And it happens every time I write a paper.
When it finally came time to write my 90-page senior thesis, a paper that was supposed to take a year to write.
I knew that for a paper of this magnitude, my usual approach wouldn't cut it.
A senior thesis is a major undertaking.
So I made a plan, deciding to do it this way.
A year's work was arranged in this manner.
Start with less work, increase steadily over the middle months, and then go full throttle in the final stretch, like stepping up on small stair steps.
How hard can climbing steps be?
No big deal, right?
But then, something interesting happened.
The first few months?
Coming and going, I basically didn't do much.
And so, there was this great revision plan.
And then... somehow the intervening months slipped by, with me barely putting pen to paper, so it ended up like this.
Then it was down to two months left, then one month, and finally just two weeks remaining.
And then one day, I suddenly realized there were only three days left until the deadline, and I hadn't written a single word yet. So I did the only thing I could: I wrote all 90 pages in 72 hours, pulling back-to-back all-nighters—something no one should ever do. I sprinted across campus in slow motion, sneaking in under the wire to submit my thesis just before the deadline.
I thought it was all over.
A week later, I received a call—it was from the school.
They asked, "Are you Tim Urban?"
I said, "Yes, that's me."
They said, "We need to talk to you about your thesis."
I replied, "Okay."
They continued, "This is the best thesis we've ever seen."
( Applause ) That did not happen.
The thesis was really, really terrible.
I just wanted to savor this moment, when all of you thought, "This guy is amazing!"
It wasn't like that, the thesis was super awful.
Anyway, I'm now a blogger.
I blogged about "inquiring till the bottom of the pot is reached."
A few years ago, I decided to write an article about procrastination.
My procrastination always bewilders those around me who don't procrastinate, so I want to explain to the non-procrastinators what goes on inside a procrastinator's head, and why we procrastinators behave the way we do.
My hypothesis is that a procrastinator's brain is different from a non-procrastinator's brain.
To prove this, I found an MRI lab that allowed me to scan my own brain, and a brain that has been proven not to belong to a procrastinator, so I could compare the two brains.
Today, I've brought them all with me.
I hope you will carefully compare whether there are any differences between the two.
I know that you are not trained neurologists, and the difference might not be obvious, but let's take a look, shall we?
This is the brain of a non-procrastinator.
Now,
This is my brain.
There is a difference between the two.
In both brains, there is a rational decision-maker, but in the procrastinator's brain, there is also a monkey representing instant gratification.
What does this mean for procrastinators?
It means that everything is fine until this happens.
[Now is the perfect time to start working.] [No way!] So when the rational decision-maker makes a rational decision to do something productive, the monkey doesn't want to do that, so he takes the wheel, and he says, "Actually, let's read about the Nancy Kerrigan/Tonya Harding scandal on Wikipedia, because I just remembered that.
Then, let's go to the fridge and see if there's anything new in there since the last 10 minutes.
Then, let's continue browsing on video websites, starting with Richard Feynman's talk on magnetism, and keep watching until we reach an interview with Justin Bieber's mom, going on indefinitely.
"All of this takes time, so there's no room in our schedule for actual work today."
Sorry!
What's going on here?
The instant gratification monkey doesn't seem like the one you want at the wheel.
He lives entirely in the present.
He has no memory of the past, no awareness of the future, and he cares about only two things: simplicity and pleasure.
In the animal kingdom, this works fine.
If you're a dog, living a simple and happy life is already a huge success!
And for the monkey, humans are just another kind of animal.
Eating well, sleeping soundly, and reproducing—the部落era might have been fine with just that. 
But in case you haven't noticed, we are no longer living in the tribal era.
We are part of an advanced civilization, which the monkey simply doesn't comprehend.
That's why we have another guy in our heads, the rational decision-maker, who enables us to do things that other animals can't.
We can anticipate the future.
We can consider the big picture.
We can make long-term plans.
And he wanted to take all of this into account.
He wants us to do anything that's worth doing right now.
Sometimes doing simple and pleasurable things is appropriate, like eating, sleeping, or enjoying some well-deserved leisure time.
That's why there's an overlap between the instant gratification monkey and the rational decision-maker.
Sometimes they agree.
But sometimes, it makes more sense to do the harder and less enjoyable things, considering the bigger picture.
This is when conflict arises between the two.
For the procrastinator, every conflict ends in this manner, with them spending a significant amount of time in the orange zone—the area of simplicity and pleasure but devoid of meaningfulness.
I call this area the Dark Playground.
The Dark Playground is a place all procrastinators know well.
This is the venue for leisure activities that take place during times when one should not be idling.
The pleasure derived from the Dark Playground is not really pleasure, as it is entirely unearned, leading to feelings of guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-loathing—emotions familiar to all procrastinators.
And the problem is, in this scenario, with the monkey at the wheel, how can a procrastinator steer themselves toward the blue area, which may be less comfortable but is where all the important stuff gets done?
The procrastinator does have a guardian angel, however, who looks down upon him and watches over him, and during those darkest hours, it is known as the Panic Monster.
The Panic Monster hibernates most of the time but awakens suddenly when a deadline looms near, or there's a risk of public embarrassment, or a career catastrophe, or any other dreadful consequence is on the horizon.
And importantly, it's the only thing the monkey is afraid of.
Recently in my life, the Panic Monster has become rather important, because six months ago, the TED staff reached out to me and invited me to give a talk.
Of course, I said yes.
I had always dreamed of giving a TED talk.
But in this excitement, the rational decision-maker seems to be thinking about something else.
He would say, "Do we realize what we just committed to?
Do we currently possess the ability to complete that future task?
We need to sit down and get to work."
And the monkey says, "Absolutely, but let's open up Google Earth and zoom down 200 feet under the surface of India, and then spend two and a half hours scrolling back up to the surface of this country so we can really get a sense of India."
That's exactly what I did that day.
As the six months became four, then two, then one, the TED staff started releasing the speakers.
I opened the website to see my face staring back at me.
Guess who wakes up at this point?
So the Panic Monster starts freaking out, and within seconds, the whole system is in chaos.
And the monkey, remember? He's scared of the Panic Monster, so up a tree he goes!
And finally, finally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel, and I can start preparing this talk.
To the Panic Monster, all that rather stupid procrastination, like spending two weeks unable to even begin the introduction to a paper, and then miraculously regaining incredible industriousness and staying up all night to write eight pages, makes perfect sense.
This entire scenario, involving these three characters, constitutes the procrastinator's system.
Not pretty, but at least functional.
This is what I decided to write about on my blog a few years ago.
After the post went live, the response I received was overwhelming.
I received thousands of emails from people in various parts of the world, engaged in all sorts of different endeavors.
There were nurses, bankers, artists, engineers, and a whole lot of PhD students.
The content was largely the same: "I have this problem too."
But what struck me was the contrast, the juxtaposition of the lighthearted tone of the post and the weighty seriousness of the emails.
These individuals felt a profound sense of frustration because procrastination was impacting their lives, because the monkey was controlling their thoughts.
After pondering this, my question is: If the procrastinator's system can function, then what's really going on?
Why do these people have such a dark corner in their lives?
What I discovered is that there are actually two types of procrastination.
All the examples I've talked about today have deadlines.
When there's a deadline, the impact of procrastination is contained within a shorter timeframe because the Panic Monster will intervene.
But for the second type of procrastination, it occurs in situations without deadlines.
For instance, if you want to start your own business or pursue a career in the arts, there are no deadlines at first, because nothing happens until you actually start doing something and generate momentum to keep things moving.
Nor do the important things outside of work have deadlines, such as visiting your family, or getting fit and healthy, working on improving a romantic relationship, or leaving an unsatisfying one.
If the procrastinator only has one mechanism for doing hard things, the Panic Monster, then there's a problem, because in these cases without deadlines, the Panic Monster doesn't show up.
There's no need for him to wake up, so the consequences of procrastination are unlimited, stretching indefinitely into the future.
And this kind of long-term procrastination, less visible and less frequently discussed than the more amusing, short-term, deadline-based kind, is what we really need to worry about.
It usually affects us quietly and subtly.
It may be a significant source of prolonged unhappiness and guilt.
I think this is why those people were sending me emails, this is why they were in such bad shape.
Not because they're frantically working on a project,
But it's this chronic procrastination that makes them feel like they're just bystanders in their own lives sometimes.
Their frustration doesn't stem from being unable to achieve their dreams; it's from not even starting to chase them.
So after reading all these emails, I had a realization that I don't think there are non-procrastinators.
That's right, I believe we're all procrastinators.
Maybe you're not a mess in every way like us, maybe some of you are good with deadlines, but remember, the monkey's most insidious trick is in the parts of your life that don't have deadlines.
Now, I want to show you one last thing.
I call it the Life Calendar.
If a person lives to be 90 years old, each week is a box.
There aren't many boxes, especially considering how many years we've already lived.
I believe we all need to take some time to seriously look at this Life Calendar.
We need to seriously consider what we're really procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating on something.
We need to be constantly aware of the presence of the instant gratification monkey.
This is something we should all do.
And because there aren't many boxes, this task perhaps should start today.
Okay, maybe not today, but...
You know what I mean.
In the near future.
Thank you.
