        "new_tgt_summary": "Matthew Williams, a multi-sport champion who has won medals at the Canada Games and represented Canada internationally in basketball, attributes his success to the Special Olympics. Despite training rigorously under expert guidance, he faces discrimination due to his intellectual disability, a common issue for many like him. Progress has been made since the Special Olympics' inception in 1968, but negative perceptions persist. Williams is among 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries competing in the World Games, which received significant media coverage but may not be widely known. He aims to raise awareness about the misconceptions and lack of recognition surrounding individuals with intellectual disabilities.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "Matthew Williams, a multi-sport champion who has excelled in the Canada Games and represented Canada internationally in basketball, credits the Special Olympics for his achievements. Despite rigorous training under expert guidance, he, along with many others, still encounters discrimination due to his intellectual disability. Since the organization's establishment in 1968 by Eunice Kennedy Shriver and supported by researchers like Dr. Frank Hayden, progress has been made in challenging societal perceptions of individuals with intellectual disabilities, but negative stereotypes persist. Williams, one of 6,500 athletes from 165 countries participating in the World Games, aims to increase awareness about the misconceptions and lack of recognition surrounding those with intellectual disabilities. His story parallels that of another athlete, who, prior to joining the Special Olympics, felt isolated and lacked confidence due to being born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability. The Special Olympics provided a non-judgmental environment where this individual could grow as a basketball player and speed skater, competing at various levels. The organization has facilitated similar positive transformations for over 4.5 million athletes globally, improving their health, self-esteem, and disproving doubts about their capacity to excel in sports. The Special Olympics has not only transformed the lives of its athletes but also shifted societal views on individuals with intellectual disabilities, showcasing their potential through high-quality sports programs.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "Matthew Williams, a multi-sport champion who attributes his success in the Canada Games and international basketball representation to the Special Olympics, highlights the organization's pivotal role in empowering athletes with intellectual disabilities since its inception in 1968 by Eunice Kennedy Shriver. Despite advancements in challenging societal perceptions, negative stereotypes endure. Williams, among 6,500 global athletes, competes in the World Games to raise awareness about the misconceptions faced by individuals with intellectual disabilities. His journey mirrors that of another athlete who, before joining the Special Olympics, felt isolated due to epilepsy and an intellectual disability. The organization offers a supportive environment for growth in sports, transforming the lives of over 4.5 million athletes worldwide by enhancing health, self-esteem, and disproving doubts about their sporting abilities. Beyond athletic development, the Special Olympics addresses critical health disparities, promoting wellness education and providing free health screenings, particularly benefiting athletes with communication barriers. Instances like Nigerian basketball players receiving hearing aids for the first time at the 2015 Summer Games exemplify the program's holistic impact. However, societal ignorance and negative attitudes continue, as evidenced by the misuse of derogatory terms and a lack of meaningful interactions between the general public and intellectually disabled individuals. Athletes like Franklin Stevens advocate for awareness and understanding, challenging misconceptions and promoting inclusion, aiming to further shift societal views and enhance the lives of athletes with intellectual disabilities.",
