You may never have heard of Kenema in Sierra Leone or Arua in Nigeria.
But I reckon they are two of the best places on the planet.
In the hospitals there, a community of nurses, surgeons, and scientists has been quietly battling one of humanity's deadliest threats -- the Lassa virus -- for years.
The Lassa virus is much like the Ebola virus.
It can cause severe fever symptoms and is often fatal.
But these people risk their lives every day to protect not just their own community members, but all of us.
The most amazing thing I learned from them is that, way back when I first visited, during those challenging days on the front lines, they began each morning by singing.
They come together, fully expressing their joy.
They embody a spirit.
Many years have passed, and as we visit each other year after year, I can join them in song, and we record these moments, which we love doing because it reminds us that we are not just engaged in a shared pursuit of scientific truth, but there's also a human bond that connects us deeply.
And you can imagine that when the world around us changes, this connection becomes all the more important, even indispensable.
In March 2014, a seismic shift occurred. An Ebola outbreak erupted in Guinea.
This was the first outbreak in the region of West Africa, occurring at the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
The situation was terrifying, and it shocked each one of us.
In fact, we even suspected at times that the reach of both the Lassa and Ebola outbreaks was more extensive than we imagined, and we feared that one day it would spread to Kenema.
So my team members immediately mobilized, went there, and joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team, setting up diagnostic facilities to do sensitive molecular testing so that when the Ebola virus crossed into Sierra Leone, we could detect it.
We had already set up this kind of facility for the Lassa virus, and we knew how to handle it; this team was incredibly proficient.
We just needed to provide them with the equipment and space to tackle Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day arrived.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to the maternity ward of the hospital, where our team conducted those crucial molecular tests and confirmed the first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
This is actually quite remarkable.
They were able to diagnose cases promptly, treat patients safely, and begin contact tracing to monitor the spread of the disease.
It could have made a difference.
But when that day arrived, the epidemic had been brewing for several months already.
After identifying hundreds of cases, it dwarfed all previous outbreaks.
And the virus didn't enter Sierra Leone through that single case; it was a massive shock wave.
We had to work closely with the international community, with the Ministry of Health, and locally in Kenema, to manage these cases. The following week brought 31 patients, then 92, and later surged to 147 – all converging on Kenema, as it was one of the few places in Sierra Leone equipped to handle the outbreak.
We worked around the clock, giving it our all, striving to help every patient and seeking recognition for our efforts, but we also did something simple.
To detect the Ebola virus, we extracted samples from the patients' blood, which we could have discarded outright.
But what we actually did with those samples was to inactivate them with chemicals, seal them in boxes, and ship them across the ocean. And that's exactly what we did.
We sent the samples to Boston, where my team is based,
We also worked around the clock, rotating shifts daily, and thus we rapidly pieced together 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
This is a blueprint — the viral genome is a blueprint.
It is also present in us humans.
It details everything that makes up our bodies, telling us a great deal about ourselves.
The outcome of these efforts is simple yet powerful.
By examining and comparing these 99 distinct viral variants, we can clearly see that, in contrast to the three genomes released from Guinea, the disease had already begun spreading in Guinea months earlier, and once it breached the human population, it was transmitted rapidly through person-to-person contact.
This information is critical, especially when you're trying to figure out how to stop the virus in its tracks. But the most important thing is contact tracing.
We can also observe that as the virus spreads from person to person, it continues to mutate.
Each mutation is critically important because all diagnostics, vaccines, and treatments we use are fundamentally based on specific genomic sequences, which are at the heart of the epidemic's spread.
Thus, global health experts had to respond swiftly, refining their research methods and adjusting every aspect of their work.
But from where I stood, the scientific method involved me getting the data, potentially being locked away in a lab for months, meticulously analyzing those data, writing up a paper, going through rounds of revisions, and finally, upon publication, making those data public.
This was the state of scientific research at the time.
Well, that approach surely wasn't going to work at that particular moment, right?
We had friends working on the front lines of fighting disease, and it was abundantly clear that what we needed most was outside help, a lot of help.
So the first thing we did was as soon as sequencing results came off the machine, we immediately put those data online.
We made it open to the world, and then we said, "Help us!"
And the help began to pour in.
Before we could even react, a crowd of people from around the world reached out to us spontaneously, delighted to see the data openly available online.
Suddenly, some of the world's best virus trackers became part of our team!
We collaborated virtually in this manner, sharing information, staying in constant communication through calls, maintaining a steady connection, aiming to track the spread of the virus minute by minute, and seeking ways to contain it.
There are actually many ways we could have assembled such a team.
Everyone, especially as the outbreak escalated globally, was continuously gathering information, getting involved, and committing to the effort.
Everyone wanted to contribute.
The collective power of people around the world is truly amazing, and the internet brings us all together.
Can you imagine? We were no longer afraid to reach out to one another, and all of us said, "Let's get to work."
Let's work together, we can make it happen!"
But the issue was that the data we all needed, the data we found on Google, was woefully inadequate for what we were trying to do.
When this happens, we miss out on a lot of opportunities.
So during the early stages of the outbreak in Kenema, we had 106 clinical records from patients, and once again, we made all of this information public.
In our own lab, given those 106 records you brought us, we could have the computer predict the next Ebola patient with near 100% accuracy.
We also developed an application specifically for releasing these predictions, ensuring that health professionals around the world could access this information.
But 106 reports are far from enough to make this method truly effective.
So we're waiting for more clinical reports before we can release that software,
And those reports never came.
We are still waiting, still tweaking the software, holed up in the lab instead of collaborating with others.
This is really... We cannot accept it at all.
Right? You, all of you couldn't accept it either.
Now is precisely the time when lives hang in the balance.
Yet, tragically, many have made the ultimate sacrifice, countless individuals working in healthcare, including my esteemed colleagues: five of them—Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moibi, Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma, and Mohamed Fullah.
These are just five among the countless healthcare workers who lost their lives in Kenema and elsewhere, while the world kept waiting, and we remained huddled in our work, isolated and disconnected from one another.
The Ebola virus, like other threats to humanity, escalates due to mistrust, fragmentation, and disconnection among people.
When we build barriers between each other and engage in conflict, the virus gains even more momentum.
But Ebola is unlike other threats, because this time, we became one family.
We are all on the same front.
One person gets Ebola, and we might be next.
So we live in this world with shared vulnerabilities, shared strengths, shared fears, shared hopes, and I hope that we can work together in joy.
One of my former students read a book about Sierra Leone and discovered that the word "Kenema," the name of the city and hospital where we worked in Sierra Leone, means in the local Mende language "as clear and pure as a river, and visible to everyone's eyes."
This has profound implications for us, which we did not fully realize at the time, but we always felt that in honor of everyone in Kenema, where we had fought so hard, we must open up and collaborate, we must share information, and we must move forward together.
We must do this.
Everyone should hold themselves and others to this standard — that when disaster strikes, we all open our hearts to one another and engage in this fight together.
Because this was not the first outbreak of Ebola, nor will it be the last, there are many other microbes out there lurking around us, much like the Lassa virus and others.
Next time, when disaster strikes, it might be in a city of a million people, where it could erupt.
The virus may potentially spread through the air.
The virus might even be deliberately spread by someone.
I know it's frightening, I understand that, but what I also know is that this experience has shown us that we have enough science and capability to win this fight, not just this fight, but to always stay one step ahead of every virus.
But we can only do so when we work together, and we must do so with joy.
So for Dr. Khan, and all those who have fallen on the front lines of battling disease, those who forever stand shoulder to shoulder with us, let us forever fight alongside them.
Our world should not be defined by the devastation wrought by a single virus; instead, it should be illuminated by the radiant collaboration of billions of hearts working together.
Thank you everyone.
