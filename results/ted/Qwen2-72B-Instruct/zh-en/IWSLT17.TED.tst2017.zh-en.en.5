Food crisis.
Appearing in the daily news.
What is that?
In some parts of the world, food is too scarce, while in other places, food production is abundant.
In some places, genetically modified foods have saved the day.
Maybe genetically modified foods are part of the problem?
Too much agricultural runoff from genetically modified crops has created dead zones in the oceans, toxic waters, and nutrient-poor conditions.
This cycle continues on and on.
I find that today's discourse is simply too inconsequential.
How can we make such discussions more comprehensible to everyone?
How about the apple food crisis?
I am sure that each of you ate an apple at some point during the past week.
How long do you think it takes for an apple to travel from the orchard to your hand?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months -- that is the average time it takes for apples to go from being picked to being sold in American supermarkets.
I suspect that the situation is similar in Europe – and, indeed, around the world.
We pick the apples, we store them in cold storage, we oxygenate the cold-storage vaults – there are documented cases of workers trying to enter such an environment to retrieve an apple and then dying, because the air inside such cold-storage vaults is toxic to humans.
Why doesn't anyone here know about this?
Why didn't I know about this?
90 percent of the nutrients in apples -- all the antioxidants in apples -- are gone by the time we purchase them.
It's just a little candy.
Why don't we know this information? What can be done to improve this situation?
I believe what we're lacking is a platform.
I know platforms - I use computers, and I've been active online since I was very young.
I've done some really weird stuff -- on these kinds of platforms.
But I also met other people, and I was able to express my own thoughts.
What is your perspective on food?
If we had a platform, we might find that this question is very advantageous, "What if?"
I wonder: What if the climate were democratic?
This is a map illustrating the global distribution of climates.
The most efficient agricultural production areas are shown in green, and the least efficient are shown in red.
They are constantly shifting and changing, with California's farmers now becoming Mexico's farmers.
China acquires land in Brazil to grow better food, and we are all slaves to the environment.
What if every country had its own climate suitable for production?
How would that change our lives?
How would that change the quality of our lives and our nutrition?
The problem for the previous generation was that we needed more food, and it had to be cheap.
Welcome to the world farm.
We have built a massive simulated farm.
These lines and tracks - for cars, planes, trains, and trucks.
Providing enough food for seven billion people is a miracle, especially when so few are involved in the actual production process.
But what if...
Do we build a digital farm?
The digital world farm.
What if you could take this apple, digitize it in a sense, transmit it through particles in the air, and then reassemble those particles on the other side?
What if?
Looking at these quoted words, you know, they inspired me to do this.
Point number one: "Japanese agriculture has no young people, no water, no land, and no future." This was said to me on the day I arrived in Minamisanriku, one stop south of Fukushima, in the aftermath of the nuclear power plant disaster.
The kids have moved to Sendai and Tokyo, the land is contaminated by the nuclear power plant accident, and they import 70% of their food.
But this is not a phenomenon unique to Japan.
Only 2% of the American population is engaged in work related to agriculture.
What answers do the 2% of the population involved in agriculture provide us?
Let's look elsewhere around the world; 50% of Africa's population is under the age of 18.
80% of them are unwilling to become farmers.
Agriculture is too demanding.
Life as a smallholder farmer is too arduous.
They choose to go to the city.
In India: Farmers' families lack access to basic farming tools, and the number of farmers committing suicide has exceeded the total of the past ten years.
It's too sad to talk about these things.
Where are they going?
To the city.
Without young people, as they have all gone to the city.
What kind of platform do we need to build to encourage young people?
Please look at this new tractor.
This is my combine harvester.
A few years ago, I went to a home improvement store chain to start looking for tools.
I've made silly things; I made plants dance by hooking them up to my computer, and then I destroyed them -- plenty of them.
I eventually managed to keep them alive.
I created one of the most intimate relationships of my life, as I learned to speak the language of plants.
I wanted them to grow bigger.
They say, "Go for it, kid!
This unused electronic studio.
What can you do about it?"
Together with my team, we built a farm inside the Media Lab, a place traditionally associated with digital living rather than biological life.
In this 60 square meter space, we produced enough rations to feed roughly 300 people for one month -- not an insignificant amount.
There's a lot of interesting tech here.
The most interesting thing is?
Beautiful, white roots, dark green plants, a monthly harvest.
Is this a new type of restaurant?
Is this a new type of retail experience?
Is this a new type of store?
What I can say for certain is: this is the first time that any plant can be uprooted in the Media Lab.
We bagged the salad; there's nothing wrong with that.
But what happens when you have an image processing expert, a data scientist, a robotics engineer, who uproots plants and thinks, "Hmm, I know something about -- I can make a plan, I want to try it out."
Throughout the process, we take the plants outside and also bring some back into the lab, because if you grow them yourself, you don't throw them away; they become precious to you.
I now have this strange tongue, because I didn't want anyone to eat them before me, and I hope they taste good.
I eat lettuce every day, and I can tell you that the pH level of lettuce is less than one.
I am now like this, "No, it's 6.1 -- no, no, you can't eat it today."
That lettuce was very sweet that day.
That's because the lettuce feels immense stress, causing it to generate a chemical response to protect itself: "I don't want to die!"
The taste of a plant not wanting to die is sweet.
The scientists return to the study of plant physiology.
I think everyone can try to get involved.
We look forward to seeing what you all create, so we've designed a lab that can be transported elsewhere.
Bringing such a concept to fruition.
The front of this Media Lab building houses my laboratory, where each plant has 30 sensor points.
If you know anything about genomics or genetics, this is the phenome, right?
The phenomena presented by the phenome.
When you say, "I like strawberries from Mexico," what you really like is the strawberry produced under those climatic conditions.
You can encode such climate conditions - levels of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and created recipes - and through programming, you can control the expression of the plant, its nutritional content, size, shape, color, and texture.
We needed data, so we placed numerous sensors to provide us with data.
You can recall the houseplants at home, looking at them sadly, thinking, "Why did you die? Would you speak to me?"
Farmers have the most beautiful eyes for foreseeing the future, when they are in their sixties and seventies,
They can tell you that the plant died due to a lack of nitrogen in the soil, a calcium deficiency, or because it required a more humid atmosphere.
These beautiful eyes will not be passed down.
These are the eyes of the farmers.
We will continue to collect data.
We link these data points to individual plants.
These are the IP address data for all the cauliflowers in my laboratory that day.
We have cauliflowers with traceable IP addresses.
If that's not weird enough for you, you can click here to see the plant's dossier.
This shows you the downloadable growth process of that plant, not what you might imagine, but rather notifying you not just when it's edible.
When does its nutrient meet my needs?
When does its flavor meet my expectations?
Is there too much water?
Has it been exposed to sunlight for too long?
It will notify you.
It can converse with me, communicate, we can have a verbal dialogue.
I think that might be the first user of Plant Facebook?
That's when the plant's dossier will start making friends.
I'm serious -- the plants will start making friends with those that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, less potassium.
We will begin to understand the complexities that now can only be guessed at.
They may not be friendly to us -- I don't know, maybe they will be, depending on our behavior.
This is my current laboratory.
This is a bit more systematic; my background is in designing hospital data centers, so I know how to create a controlled environment.
So -- in this environment, we experiment with all sorts of things.
This process, aeroponics, was developed by NASA for the Mir space station, to reduce the amount of water resources they needed to transport into space.
What this process does is precisely provide the plant with what it wants: water, minerals, and oxygen.
The roots are not that complicated, and when you deliver these to them, you see amazing results.
Plants have two hearts.
Because they have two hearts, they exhibit hypergrowth of four to five times.
This is a perfect world.
We've been on a long technological journey seeking a different world, and we will continue to do so, but we will also have new tools, creating a perfect world.
We grow all sorts of things.
These tomatoes have not been commercially produced in the past 150 years.
Do you know we have a rare, old seed bank?
Seed bank.
This is awesome.
They have living germplasm, food you haven't eaten.
I am the only person in this room who has eaten this type of tomato.
The problem is, these are sauce tomatoes, which we don't know how to cook, so we think that sauce tomatoes don't taste good.
But we've grown all sorts of protein-rich items.
We've grown humans -- maybe you can, but we can't.
We realized that the equipment was too big and also too expensive.
I started placing them around the world for about $100,000 each.
Finding people who could casually afford $100,000 wasn't easy, so we wanted to make smaller tools.
This was actually a project by one of my students -- an undergraduate in mechanical engineering, Camille.
Camille and I, along with my team, spent the entire summer iterating, figuring out how to make it cheaper, how to make it work better, and how to make it something that other people could also learn to operate.
Then we took these tools to school kids, grades seven through 11.
If you want to be humbled, try teaching kids something.
I went to this school and said, "Set its humidity to 65%"
A seventh-grade kid asked, "What's humidity?"
So I said, "Oh, it's water in the air."
He said, "There's no water in the air, you moron."
So I said, "Okay, don't believe me then.
In fact -- don't believe me, right?
Set it to 100.
He set the humidity to 100, so what happened?
Condensation begins, creating fog, and eventually it starts to drip.
Then he said, "Oh, humidity is rain."
"Why didn't you tell me that before?"
The interface we created looks like a game.
They have a 3D environment, able to log in from phones, from computers, all around the world.
There are different components in the program -- physical controls, sensors.
They chose recipes that kids from other parts of the world had already created.
They select and activate the recipes, planting the seeds.
As the seeds grow, the kids can make adjustments.
They say, "Why does the plant need CO2? Isn't CO2 a bad thing?
It can suffocate you."
Increasing the supply of carbon dioxide, the plant died.
Decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide, the plant thrived.
Harvesting the plants, you create new digital recipes.
This is a process of iterative design, development, and exploration.
They can download all the data on the new plants they've developed, or the new digital recipes - what it does - is it better or worse?
Imagine these as the core elements being processed one by one.
We can learn a lot from this.
This is what we call the Food Computer, which was placed in a school for three weeks.
This is three weeks of growing.
More importantly, for the first time, this child believed he could be a farmer -- or rather, he wanted to become a farmer.
So we made these resources open.
They're all online; go home and try building your very first Food Computer.
This will be hard -- I'm telling you this.
We're just getting started, but the resources are there.
For me, making these easily accessible is really important.
We will also continue to do so.
These are farmers, electronics engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, botanists, economists, and urban planners.
On one platform, doing what each is good at.
The team became too large.
This is my new experimental setup that is beginning to operate.
This warehouse can be built anywhere.
This is why I chose it.
Inside this warehouse, we will set up racks like these.
It can be seen right now.
Take a look at this,
This also exists.
One grows green vegetables, the other grows the Ebola virus vaccine.
What's great is that plants, along with this winning project from the American Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), are what make our research on the Ebola virus so effective.
These plants are producing proteins that combat the Ebola virus.
So from pharmaceuticals and health supplements, back to lettuce cultivation.
But these two things look completely different, and that's part of my domain expertise.
But many things are not as imagined.
We're still in the "we're right" phase, like, "This is my little black box --" "No, buy mine."
"No, no, no -- my intellectual property is absolutely valuable."
"Don't buy that, buy mine."
In reality, we are just at the beginning, a time when society is also in transition.
As we demand more and cheaper food, we now need food that is higher quality and environmentally friendly.
But when you see McDonald's advertising the ingredients of McNuggets, the most mysterious food in human history -- McDonald's marketing plan is changing -- everything is changing.
Now let's look at the world today.
Personal Food Computers, Food Servers, Food Data Centers, operating in open phenomes.
Like open genomes, but we're going to aggregate little climate recipes, like Wikipedia, where you can fork, run and grow.
How does this look?
Do you remember when the world was tied together with string?
Bacon is starting to appear.
We started sending information about food instead of distributing food.
This is not just my fantasy; this is work that we've already been doing.
Food Computers, Food Servers, and soon Food Data Centers, connect people to share information.
The future of food is not a battle against its flaws,
We all know where the faults lie.
The future of food is about connecting the next billion farmers and empowering them with a Q&A platform, "What if?"
Thank you.
