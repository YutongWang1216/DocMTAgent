        "new_tgt_summary": "The author studied political science in college, requiring extensive paper writing. Unlike the methodical approach of an average student, who spreads the workload evenly, the author consistently procrastinates until the last minute. Recognizing the inadequacy of this habit for their significant 90-page senior thesis, which was supposed to be completed over a year, the author devised a new strategy. This plan involved starting slowly, gradually increasing effort through the middle months, and intensifying work in the final stages. However, the author still found themselves not doing much during the initial months, leading to the need for substantial revisions later on.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, having studied political science in college, often found themselves writing extensive papers. Unlike most students who distribute their efforts evenly, the author had a habit of procrastinating until the last minute. This habit proved problematic when faced with a significant 90-page senior thesis, which was supposed to be completed over a year. To combat this issue, the author devised a strategy involving a gradual increase in effort from a slow start to intense work in the final stages. Unfortunately, this approach still led to minimal work being done in the early months, necessitating significant revisions later. In another instance, the author delayed the same 90-page thesis until there were only three days left before the deadline. They managed to finish it within 72 hours, including two consecutive all-nighters, but the result was of poor quality. Despite imagining receiving praise, the author acknowledged the thesis's shortcomings. Now a blogger, the author, who has written about procrastination before, decided to delve deeper by comparing the brains of procrastinators and non-procrastinators, hypothesizing that there may be neurological differences between the two. To test this theory, the author planned to scan their own brain and compare it with that of a non-procrastinator.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, a former political science student turned blogger with a history of procrastination, reflects on their academic experience where they consistently delayed assignments until the last minute. This habit became particularly challenging during their senior year when faced with a 90-page thesis, which required a year-long commitment. Despite attempting a strategy of gradually increasing effort, the author still found themselves making minimal progress initially, resulting in rushed and subpar work that needed substantial revisions. In a desperate attempt to meet the deadline, the author completed the thesis within 72 hours, including two consecutive all-nighters, acknowledging the poor quality of the final product. Intrigued by their procrastination tendencies, the author embarked on a personal investigation comparing the brains of procrastinators and non-procrastinators. Through this exploration, they identified that while both brains possess a rational decision-maker, procrastinators' brains also house an instant-gratification seeking monkey. This monkey takes control at critical moments, steering the procrastinator away from productive tasks towards simpler, pleasure-seeking activities like aimless internet browsing or fridge exploration, ignoring past experiences and future consequences, thus hindering effective time management and responsibility fulfillment. To further understand these differences, the author planned to undergo a brain scan and compare the results with those of a non-procrastinator.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, a former political science student turned blogger, shares their experience with chronic procrastination during their academic career, notably during their senior year when they were tasked with completing a 90-page thesis. Despite efforts to manage time effectively, the author found themselves repeatedly delaying assignments until the last minute, leading to rushed work that required significant revisions. In a last-ditch effort, the thesis was completed in a 72-hour marathon, including two all-nighters, with the author recognizing the compromised quality of the final product. This pattern prompted a personal inquiry into the neurological differences between procrastinators and non-procrastinators. The author discovered that while both groups have a rational decision-maker in their brains, procrastinators also harbor an \"instant-gratification monkey\" that takes over at pivotal moments, diverting attention from important tasks to trivial pleasures like mindless web surfing or unnecessary snacking. This monkey disregards past experiences and future implications, disrupting responsible behavior and time management. To delve deeper into these disparities, the author intended to undergo a brain scan for comparison with a non-procrastinator's results. This exploration reveals the tension between the primitive urge for instant gratification, akin to animal instincts, and the uniquely human ability to plan for the future. This conflict often leads procrastinators into the \"Dark Playground,\" a figurative realm where time is wasted on unproductive yet momentarily satisfying activities instead of pursuing meaningful objectives, illustrating the battle between short-term pleasure and long-term goal orientation in human conduct.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, transitioning from a political science student to a blogger, candidly discusses their struggle with chronic procrastination, particularly during their senior year when faced with writing a 90-page thesis. Despite attempts at effective time management, the author consistently delayed assignments until the eleventh hour, resulting in rushed, subpar work that necessitated substantial revisions. The culmination of this pattern was a 72-hour marathon to complete the thesis, including two consecutive all-nighters, which highlighted the compromised quality of the final product. This experience sparked a personal investigation into the neurological distinctions between procrastinators and non-procrastinators, revealing that while both possess a rational decision-maker, procrastinators are also influenced by an \"instant-gratification monkey\" that usurps control at critical junctures. This entity prioritizes fleeting pleasures over responsibilities, leading procrastinators into the \"Dark Playground,\" a metaphorical space where time is squandered on unproductive but momentarily gratifying activities. The Dark Playground yields unearned pleasure that is often followed by feelings of guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-loathing. Navigating away from this trap is complicated by the 'monkey's' dominance, though the Panic Monster, a figurative guardian angel, intervenes as deadlines draw near or consequences become imminent, instilling fear in the 'monkey' and enabling the procrastinator to concentrate on crucial tasks. This dynamic was exemplified when the author, despite being committed to delivering a TED talk, found themselves ensnared in trivial pursuits until the Panic Monster's presence forced the 'rational decision-maker' to take charge and initiate preparation for the talk. To further explore these contrasts, the author planned to undergo a brain scan for comparison against a non-procrastinator's, aiming to shed light on the complex interplay between primitive desires for instant gratification and the human capacity for forward planning.",

A defining moment came when they spent 72 hours straight completing the thesis, including two back-to-back all-nighters, which underscored the diminished quality of the final submission. This prompted a deeper exploration into the neurological differences between procrastinators and non-procrastinators, revealing that while both have a rational decision-maker, procrastinators are also swayed by an \"instant-gratification monkey\" that seizes control at pivotal moments. This entity prioritizes immediate pleasures over duties, steering procrastinators into the \"Dark Playground,\" a symbolic realm where time is wasted on unproductive yet momentarily satisfying activities, often followed by feelings of guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-disdain. Escaping this trap is hindered by the 'monkey's' dominance, although the Panic Monster, a figurative guardian angel, intervenes as deadlines approach or repercussions loom, instilling fear in the 'monkey' and enabling procrastinators to focus on essential tasks. This pattern was evident when the author, despite being dedicated to delivering a TED talk, found themselves absorbed in trivial pursuits until the Panic Monster's presence compelled the 'rational decision-maker' to commence preparation. To delve deeper into these disparities, the author intended to undergo a brain scan for comparison against a non-procrastinator's, seeking to illuminate the intricate dance between primal urges for instant gratification and the human aptitude for forward planning. The author then illustrates the paradoxical nature of procrastinators' behavior, which appears irrational but is logical within their distinct psychological context. This cycle entails initial procrastination followed by heightened productivity spurred by the Panic Monster nearing deadlines. The author notes the universal recognition of this phenomenon, receiving emails from individuals across various fields who resonate with this challenge. Despite the lighthearted tone of the blog post, the feedback emphasizes the profound effect of procrastination on people's lives, as they feel enslaved by their incapacity to act timely. Two forms of procrastination are identified: one linked to deadline-bound tasks, which the Panic Monster assists in overcoming, and another tied to open-ended objectives or personal affairs lacking explicit deadlines, where the absence of a Panic Monster intensifies the problem, leading to perpetual procrastination and its wide-ranging implications. In conclusion, the discussion elucidates the intricacy of procrastination, differentiating between its manageable manifestation with deadlines and its more pernicious form without them, and stresses the necessity for tactics beyond the Panic Monster to effectively tackle procrastination in every facet of life.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, transitioning from a political science student to a blogger, shares their journey through chronic procrastination, particularly during their senior year when faced with writing a 90-page thesis. Despite efforts to manage time effectively, the author repeatedly deferred assignments until the last minute, culminating in a 72-hour marathon to complete the thesis, which highlighted the subpar quality of rushed work. This experience led to an investigation into the neurological differences between procrastinators and non-procrastinators, revealing the presence of an \"instant-gratification monkey\" that takes control at critical moments, steering individuals into the \"Dark Playground\" of unproductive activities. The Panic Monster, acting as a guardian angel, intervenes near deadlines or potential consequences, compelling procrastinators to focus on essential tasks. This pattern was evident in the author's preparation for a TED talk, where they were only spurred into action by the Panic Monster's imminent presence. Seeking to understand these disparities further, the author planned to undergo a brain scan for comparison with a non-procrastinator's. The paradoxical nature of procrastinators' behavior is explored, highlighting the cycle of initial procrastination followed by heightened productivity spurred by the Panic Monster. While the author's humorous blog post resonated with individuals across various fields, it underscored the serious impact of procrastination on people's lives, with many feeling enslaved by their inability to act promptly. Two types of procrastination are distinguished: deadline-bound procrastination, which the Panic Monster helps overcome, and long-term procrastination related to open-ended objectives or personal matters, where the absence of a Panic Monster exacerbates the issue, leading to continuous procrastination and broader ramifications. The author addresses long-term procrastination, suggesting that everyone procrastinates in some aspect of their life, often tricked by the \"instant gratification monkey\" into delaying pursuit of dreams. Encouraging readers to reflect on their Life Calendar and become aware of what they are truly procrastinating on, the author stresses the importance of addressing procrastination immediately, albeit humorously adding \"maybe not today, but...\" at the end, acknowledging the struggle but advocating for constant vigilance against the instant gratification monkey.",
