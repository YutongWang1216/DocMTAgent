I come from Seattle, Washington, one of the most liberal, tolerant, and promising cities in the United States.
I grew up in a wonderful family in Seattle.
My mother was an artist, and my father was a college professor, and I am deeply grateful for the way they raised me, allowing me to chart my own course in life in whatever way I deemed appropriate.
In fact, my choices were somewhat different from what my parents had envisioned.
At the age of 19, I dropped out of college - I flunked out, or more accurately, I was expelled.
I embarked on the path to becoming a professional French horn player, which had been my lifelong dream.
I performed chamber music across the United States and Europe, touring for several years with the exceptional jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd.
In my twenties, I was thrilled to join the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a wonderful life it has been!
And my parents never complained,
They supported me all the way through,
Even though it wasn't their dream.
They used to tell their neighbors and friends, "Our son is going to 'take a break' for ten years."
And there's an awkward conversation about my life that I want to share with you.
I was 27, and I had come home from Barcelona, and it was Christmas Day, and I came over to see my parents, and I was helping my mom make dinner, and it was just the two of us in the kitchen.
She was silent at the time, not saying a word.
I felt something was off.
I asked my mother, "Mom, what are you thinking about?"
She said, "Your father and I are really worried about you."
I was surprised: "What? What do you have to worry about now?"
She replied, "I want you to honestly answer my question: Did you vote for the Republicans?"
The truth is, I wasn't much interested in politics; I was just a French horn player.
But I got it a little bit, that they sensed something, and so they were a little confused.
At that point, I became a rabid capitalist, and let me tell you why.
Believe it or not, it stems from my lifelong study of poverty.
When I was a child in Seattle, I remember it was the first time I was exposed to real poverty.
My family was lower middle class, but that of course was not real poverty.
Not at all.
The first time I saw the true face of poverty was in the early 1970s, when I was only six or seven years old.
Like many of us, this is an ordinary tale.
It was a picture in National Geographic of a child in an East African country, about my own age, with flies on his face and a bloated belly.
I knew he couldn't make it, I knew, and yet I was powerless to do anything.
Some of you may remember a similar image, not necessarily identical, but one that bears a striking resemblance.
It revealed to the Western world the unbearable poverty that existed in other parts of the globe.
That image lingered in my mind, accompanying me through my growth, schooling, dropout, and the beginning of building my own family.
I often wonder what became of that child?
What about others like him in other parts of the world?
I began to study this question, even though I was no longer in college, still searching for answers: What had happened to the poorest people in the world?
Had it gotten worse, or had it improved? What had really happened?
I eventually found the answer, and it changed my life. I want to share it with you.
In fact, most Americans felt, from childhood, from the moment they saw these images until now,
Poverty had gotten worse. If you asked Americans, "Has the problem of global poverty gotten worse or better?" 70 percent would say that hunger had worsened since the early 1970s.
But the reality is this.
This was the moment that changed my mind, the moment of my epiphany.
Since 1970, the percentage of the world's population living on less than one dollar a day, adjusted for inflation, has fallen by 80 percent.
Since I was a child, the percentage of the world's poorest people has decreased by 80%.
And yet, I was unaware of this fact.
My friends, this is a miracle!
This is something we should celebrate.
This is the greatest achievement in human history against poverty, and it happened within our lifetimes.
When I learned this fact, I wondered, what made it possible to lift people out of poverty?
For if you don't know why, it will be a transient phenomenon.
We need to replicate this success to lift the remaining 200 million people out of poverty, because that's the question we've been grappling with: since I was a child, 2 billion of the poorest people, our brothers and sisters, have been lifted out of poverty.
I want to save the remaining 2 billion, so I need to know why.
I searched for the answer,
It wasn't a political answer, because I simply didn't care about political solutions.
Still, I don't care today.
I sought the best answers from mainstream economists, whether they were left-wing, right-wing, or centrist economists.
Below
I began to look for specific reasons.
From childhood to the present, 2 billion people have been lifted out of poverty.
There are five reasons. First: globalization.
Second: free trade
Third: property rights
Fourth: rule of law
Fifth: entrepreneurship
These are the results of the free-market economic system that swept the globe after 1970.
I am not naive.
I know that the free-market economy is far from perfect, and I also know that it does not fulfill all our needs for building a better world.
But it is great.
And it transcends politics.
This was one of the things I learned and had an epiphany about.
Capitalism is not just about the accumulation of capital.
Its brilliance lies in its connection to aspiration, something many people on this stage have spoken about - aspiration born of dreams, rooted in the free market system.
We need to get more people to understand this.
Now, I want to talk about my second epiphany, which is related to the first. I believe it will not only contribute to the development of the world but also to the advancement of our country.
To paraphrase someone else's words, summarizing the point just made about lifting people out of poverty: "The free market has created more wealth than any other system in history."
And has lifted billions of people out of poverty."
Whose famous quote?
Like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
Incorrect!
It's President Obama!
Why did it stick with me so vividly?
Because he said it to me.
You wouldn't have guessed, would you?
I exclaimed at the time, "Hallelujah!"
Not only that, I said, "What a brilliant opportunity."
Do you know what I was thinking at the time?
In May 2015, we held an event at Georgetown University focused on the subject matter of our work.
At that moment, I conceived a solution to what I believe is the greatest challenge facing the United States today. What is it?
It's about liberals and conservatives coming together to discuss these ideas and help those who need us the most.
Needless to say, everyone here is aware that we are in crisis, in the United States and in other countries around the world where political divisions run deep,
This issue is already upon us.
This cannot help but fill one with grave concern.
Last year, an article was published in one of the most influential and cutting-edge scientific journals in the West, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
That was a 2014 article about asymmetric political motivation.
What is it? Psychologists describe this phenomenon as assuming that your worldview is based on love, while the other's is based on hate.
This is common in global conflicts.
Such as between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the author of this piece has found is that in contemporary America, there is a substantial divide among Republicans and Democrats regarding their political motivations.
Today, most politically active people in our country believe that they are driven by love, while the rest are motivated by hate.
Consider this.
Most people are always saying: "My ideology is based on benevolence; I want to help people. And the others, they are evil, trying to bring me down."
Societies riven by such divisions cannot advance.
This is impossible.
How are we going to solve this problem?
First, let's be honest: the divisions exist.
We cannot minimize the divisions, for that would be childish.
There has been quite a bit of deep research on this.
My friend Jonathan Haidt, a regular at TED.
He is a psychology professor at New York University.
He studies the minds, values, and moralities of different people, exploring how they differ.
He demonstrates that conservatives and liberals have vastly different perspectives on what they consider important.
For instance, Jonathan Haidt illustrates that liberals care about poverty 59% more than they care about economic freedom.
And conservatives care about economic freedom 28% more than they care about poverty.
Seemingly irreconcilable differences, right?
Is it impossible for us to come together? No!
Our strength lies precisely within these divisions.
Remember what stops poverty:
It is the obsession with and concern for poverty, coupled with a commitment to a liberal economic order worldwide.
We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people, to help another two billion souls out of poverty.
There is no other way.
Well.
How are we going to do this?
This is a subtle thing, isn't it?
We need to innovate our thinking.
Many innovative ideas have graced this stage.
Yes! That extraordinary spirit of social entrepreneurship.
We must invest abroad, in a sustainable, responsible, and ethical manner.
But do you know what we really need?
We need to open up new horizons for flexible thinking,
We need less of the "predictable,"
Right?
Have you ever felt that your thoughts are becoming predictable?
Begin to follow routines?
Do you find yourself always listening to those who echo your own opinions?
Why is that dangerous?
Because when we talk about economics in this country, it's the conservatives who are always talking about taxes, regulations, and the overreach of big government.
And on the other side are the liberals, who when discussing the economy, always focus on income inequality.
Right? Those things do matter, they matter to me, they matter to you.
But when there are people going hungry who need our help, these become just distractions.
We should rally around what works best to alleviate poverty wherever we can, for only when conservatives recognize that they need liberals' concern for the poor, and liberals need conservatives' obsession with free markets, will we truly make progress.
Only then will we succeed. It is by choosing this path that such diversity will foster the strength of future nations.
How do we achieve this? How do we come together to achieve it?
I have some action items to suggest, for you and for myself.
Action item number one: Remember, it is not good enough to merely tolerate others' differing opinions,
It is far from enough.
We must remember that we need the people we disagree with, for there are those who need all of our help, and they are still waiting.
What are you prepared to do? How will you show it?
Where do we start? Right here!
All of us here, we are the fortunate ones.
We have those who listen to us,
We are successful, we possess leadership.
Perhaps only when people hear the ideas of our unknown ideology will they listen to us.
Perhaps this is where success begins.
This is the first point. Second.
Second: I am asking you, and myself, to be particular persons who blur the lines, to be ambiguous and hard to pin down.
If you're a conservative, be a conservative who talks about poverty often, and a warrior who holds fast to the moral imperative to fight for the poor.
If you're a liberal, be a liberal who often sings the praises of the free market when it operates responsibly.
If we do that, both goals are within reach.
First: Let's get to work helping the next 2 billion people, solving problems the way we've solved so many before, and setting ourselves up to solve even more in the future. This is within our grasp.
Second, we might just win the awful ideological war that has plagued us, transforming it into a contest of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
Perhaps, just perhaps, we might find that the differences we claim to have are not as irreconcilable as we thought.
Thank you!
