There we were, soul and body crammed into a Texas church, on what would be the last night of our lives.
It was like this room, only there were creaky wooden pews and tattered red banners hanging about, an organ to my left, the choir behind me, and a baptismal font built into the back wall.
In short, it was just like this room.
The same intense sense of suspense, the same deep longing for redemption, the same sour sweat in the palms, and the same group of distracted people in the back row.
It was December 31st, 1999, and that night, as far as I knew, Christ was returning to Earth and the world was ending.
I was twelve then, at that age when one becomes accountable.
I found it so unfair that Jesus was coming back just when I was about to be held responsible for everything I had done up until then. But when I stopped complaining, I figured I'd better hurry up and get my house in order.
I went to church as much as I could.
I feared the silence around me, as one fears noise, only to repeatedly reassure myself that God wasn't playing a trick on me, coming back early and leaving me behind.
But in case he did come back early, I had a backup plan, one I'd read about in the popular "Left Behind" books.
In the pages, I saw that if I wasn't taken after the midnight revelry, I would have another chance.
I simply needed to avoid being labeled a heretic, defeat the devil, overcome plagues, and take down the Antichrist.
This would be quite difficult — but I believed I could do it.
But the time for preparation had long passed.
It was already 11:50 p.m.
We had ten minutes left, and the pastor had us rise from the pews and make our way down to the altar, because he wanted us to pray together at the stroke of midnight.
The congregation then split into groups, moving to their assigned positions.
The choir was still on the small stage, and the deacons of the church and their wives — whom I preferred to call the "Baptist bourgeoisie" — took their seats in the first row before the altar.
You know, even on the night of Christ's return in America, there are VIP seats.
Directly behind the Baptist bourgeoisie were the elders—men and women whose once-young spines had been bent by the scorching sun over the cotton fields of East Texas, their weathered faces burnished to a noble brown like the clay of East Texas itself. Their dreams and fantasies of life and the world beyond East Texas, sometimes more broken than their spines.
Yes — these men and women were my idols, my stars.
They had waited their entire lives for this moment, just as their medieval forebears had yearned for the end of the world, just as my grandmother longed for the Oprah Winfrey Show, which aired promptly at four o'clock every day on Channel Eight.
As she made her way to the altar, I slipped in behind her, for I was certain beyond a doubt that my grandmother was heaven-bound.
I thought that if I held her hand tightly during this prayer, I might go with her.
So I gripped tighter, closed my eyes, listened, and waited.
The prayers grew louder.
The shouts responding to the prayers grew equally louder.
The organ sounded, intertwining with the voices of the dirge.
A heat wave swept over, making the sweat in my palms even more sour.
I gripped even tighter; I didn't want to be abandoned by God.
I squeezed my eyes shut even tighter; I didn't want to see the wheat being taken and the chaff left behind.
Suddenly, a voice echoed overhead: "Amen."
It was over.
I look at the clock.
It was past midnight.
I watched the older believers, whose savior had not come; they were too proud to show even a hint of disappointment, too thoroughly and for too long indoctrinated for there to be any room for doubt now.
But I felt indignant for them.
They had been duped, hoodwinked, deceived, and yet I had followed along,被骗翻译为been deceived，保持了一致性且符合语境。同时，整句翻译的风格也与前文保持一致，体现了反思、紧张与虔诚的语气。受骗翻译为followed along，表示跟随他们一起被骗，符合回忆录/自述体的风格。) they had swallowed the bait, hook, line, and sinker, and so had I.
I prayed the prayers they did, struggling against the desires in my heart.
I didn't just dip, but submerged twice into that cold, likely-to-induce-a-cold baptismal font.
I once believed.
What now?
I turn on the TV at home, catching Peter Jennings announcing the new millennium, with the world celebrating the New Year.
I suddenly realized, strange as it seemed, that Jesus would have to keep coming back repeatedly, simply because of the different time zones around the world.
This made me feel even worse inside, really hurt.
But on that very night, I did not stop believing.
I merely came to believe something else: that disbelief was also possible.
It's likely that all the answers I know are wrong, and it's possible that the questions themselves are misguided.
Now, where once stood the towering peaks of faith, a spring of questioning flows steadily to the foot of the mountain, a clear stream of doubt that is destined to become mighty rivers.
All the dramatic narratives of my life can be traced back to that night in the church, when my savior did not arrive; the things I held most certain, if not outright lies, were certainly no truths.
Though most of you welcomed the millennium in far different ways, I suspect you're here because some of you have done what I did in the aftermath of that night—the night after my mother died, the night after my father walked out, the night after my savior did not come.
I extended my hands, desperately searching for something to hold onto in belief.
When I arrived at Yale University at age eighteen, I searched, believing that having journeyed from a small town in Texas, I had the chance to escape all the hardships and trials I had endured, to leave behind the shattered dreams and disabled bodies.
But when I returned home during winter break and found myself with my head pressed to the ground, my hands bound tightly behind my back, and a robber's gun against my skull, I knew that even the finest education could not save me.
When I interned at Lehman Brothers in 2008, I too was searching.
Fueled by hope—I excitedly called my family to tell them that we would never be poor again.
But when I watched helplessly as this temple of finance crumbled before my eyes into ruins, I knew that even the best job could not save me.
When I arrived in Washington D.C. as a young journalist, I searched, and I heard a voice from Illinois: "It has been a long time coming," "but the moment is here, America, for change." (referring to Obama's campaign speech)
But when the parliamentary work came to a grinding halt, and the nation teetered on the brink of collapse, turning all notions of hope and change into cruel punchlines, I knew that even a political renaissance could not save me.
I knelt devoutly at the altar of the American Dream, praying to the giants of our age for success, for wealth, for power.
But every time, when the midnight bell tolled and I opened my eyes, I saw these myths all die.
From this graveyard, I began to search once more, not because I was brave, but because I knew that without belief, I would perish.
So I made my way to yet another holy site to pay homage, Harvard Business School—this time, knowing that I could not simply accept the salvation offered by the institution.
No, I knew there was more work to be done.
It all began in the dark corner of a crowded party on a cold winter night in Massachusetts, where my three friends and I posed a question that young people with genuine aspirations often ask: "What if we just hit the road?"
We didn't know where we were going or how we'd get there, but we knew we had to set out.
Because what we yearn for our whole lives, as Jack Kerouac wrote, is to "dive into the endless night and vanish into the far horizon." To go out and see what everyone across the country is up to.
So even though there were dissenting voices saying we were taking too big a risk and getting nothing out of it, we set out anyway.
In the summer of 2013, we traveled 13,000 kilometers across America, through Montana's cattle ranches, Detroit's decaying urban landscape, and New Orleans' swampy wetlands, where we met people and worked for them, supporting their small businesses that placed achieving goals at the bottom line. 
After studying at the "West Point of capitalism," we found this idea to be nothing short of revolutionary.
This idea spread, eventually growing into a nonprofit organization called "MBAs Across America," which is primarily why I stand before you today.
It spread because we discovered a strong desire among our generation to achieve goals and fulfill life's purpose.
It spread because in every nook and cranny of America, we found countless entrepreneurs who were creating jobs, transforming lives, and needed just a little bit of help.
But truth be told, it spread also because I worked tirelessly to spread it. To spread this gospel,
There was nothing I wouldn't do to convince more people that we could heal the wounds of this broken country, one small business at a time.
But it was this process of spreading the gospel that led me to find a somewhat different gospel, which I want to share with you all today.
It began on a night nearly a year ago, at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where we attended a Harvard Business School alumni dinner.
Beneath a full-size model of a whale, I sat side by side with the titans of our age, who sang praises of their peers and their mighty deeds.
The room was thick with pride, as the total assets under these individuals' names amounted to over half a trillion dollars.
We looked upon all creation and deemed it good.
And yet, two days later, there I was in Harlem, New York, sitting in an urban farm that had once been an abandoned parking lot, listening to a man named Tony talk about the kids who came by every day.
All of them were below the poverty line.
Many people carried all their possessions in backpacks, fearful of having them stolen at the shelter.
Some came to Tony's farm, called "Harlem Grown," for their only meal of the day.
Tony told me that he had started "Harlem Grown" using his own pension fund, earned from driving a taxi for 20 years.
He said he hadn't left a penny for himself, because even though the project was considered a success, resources were still extremely scarce.
He said that any help he could find, he would accept.
And I was there to help him.
But when I left Tony, I felt a sharp pang in my heart, and tears moistened the corners of my eyes.
I felt the weight of inspiration, able to sit in a room one evening with hundreds of people worth half a trillion dollars, envisioning a better world, yet just two days later in another room, only fifty blocks away, a man without a salary was providing the only meal of the day for children.
But it wasn't the glaring social inequality that brought tears to my eyes, nor was it the hungry, homeless children, or the anger at the 1%, or pity for the 99%.
No, what left me restless was the realization that this country needed a radical transformation, and I was merely making minor adjustments.
I realized that my story represented a group of people who hoped to pull themselves up by their bootstraps even when they had nothing; that my organization embodied all the fundamental, systemic assistance that never reached Harlem, or Appalachia, or New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward; and that my cry represented voices that sounded devoid of sophistication, unrefined, and out of place.
And this sense of shame, this shame washed over me, much like the shame of sitting before the television, watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium, again, and again, and again.
I had been duped, deceived, and deluded,
But this time, the false savior was none other than myself.
You know, I've come a long way from that altar where I thought the world would end one night, from a small town that spoke in tongues and believed suffering was a divine gift, holding it as a creed, as eternal truth.
Yes, my journey has been so long that it has brought me right back to where I started.
For we cannot simply generalize and say that this era is devoid of faith. No, we believe in something just as we always have, at every other time.
Some might believe in the prophecies of Brené Brown or Tony Robbins. We might believe in the maxims of The New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review.
We may believe wholeheartedly in what we worship in the cathedral of TED, but we desperately want to believe, we need to believe.
We mimic the speech and mannerisms of charismatic leaders who promise solutions to all of humanity's problems.
We treat suffering as a gift bestowed upon us by the capitalist "God," and we hold technological progress as our creed, as eternal truth.
But we never acknowledged the human cost we bore, unwilling to challenge even a single brick for fear the entire edifice would crumble.
But if you find yourself unsettled by these violations of common decency that we have come to accept, the time for questioning will surely arrive.
So the gospel I preach is not one of disruption, innovation, or sustainability.
I don't even have a gospel of belief to share with you.
The only gospel I have is one of questioning.
The gospel of questioning does not ask you to stop believing; it asks you to believe in something new: that disbelief is also possible.
It's likely that all the answers we think we know are wrong, and it's possible that the questions themselves are misguided.
Yes, the gospel of questioning may mean that our very existence, on this stage, in this room, is all mistaken.
Because it leads to one question: "Why?"
With such immense power at our fingertips, why are there still people suffering in dire straits?
This questioning led me to a decision: the organization I had founded, "MBAs Across America," would cease operations.
We've disbanded our staff, shut up shop, and we've made this model open to all, requiring no approval from us if they feel capable of carrying it forward.
This questioning compels me to discard the savior hat that others have placed upon my head, for our lives are too short and the odds too slim to wait for the return of Christ; the reality is, there are no miracles in this world.
And it is this questioning that drives me, that gives me hope when hardships threaten to overwhelm us, when the path of fate seems to lead us astray, when our saviors fail to heal our wounds. It is not our blind faith, but our simple questioning, that sheds a little light into the darkness of our lives and the world. Let us whisper softly,
Shout it out, or simply say, very simply: "Surely, there must be another way."
Thank you.
