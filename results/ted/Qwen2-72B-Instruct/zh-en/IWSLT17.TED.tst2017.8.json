        "new_tgt_summary": "In 1985, when the author relocated to Harare, Zimbabwe's national health policy prioritized social justice, implementing a socialist program that made primary healthcare and education virtually free. This led to a significant expansion of rural health clinics, making healthcare accessible to 80% of the population within a two-hour walk. Immunization rates for children rose from 25% in 1980 to 80% by 1990. However, the arrival of AIDS in 1985 presented a major challenge. Initially, the infection rate was around 2%, but it escalated to one in four adults by the time the author left Harare 17 years later. In response to the epidemic, the author and colleagues established a clinic, promoted condom use, conducted community outreach, performed research, and advised on self-protection measures for individuals affected by AIDS. Throughout this period, the author witnessed the loss of colleagues, friends, students, and patients to the disease. Despite the difficulties, the author felt privileged to contribute to both the African independence movement and a global public health initiative.",

        "new_src_summary": "这段深刻的个人叙述跨越了数十年，在津巴布韦哈拉雷的公共卫生领域编织了一幅复杂的历史画卷，展现了社会正义与疾病斗争的交织。1985年，作者移居哈拉雷，正值津巴布韦新政府致力于提升社会公正，将健康医疗服务和初等教育作为基本免费项目，极大地提升了儿童免疫接种率。作者自豪地投身于这一进步之中，与津巴布韦人民、科学家、医生和活动家并肩作战，感受着革命的热情和团结。然而，这一时期也见证了艾滋病的无情侵袭，从1985年津巴布韦报告首例病例开始，感染率迅速攀升，对社会造成深远影响。为了应对这场危机，作者及其团队开设了诊所，推广避孕套使用，展开学校和工作场所的宣传教育，进行研究，并为艾滋病感染者及其伴侣提供保护建议，展现了面对全球健康危机时医疗工作者的责任感与行动力。\n\n随着时间的推移，作者在临床和传染病研究中逐渐觉醒，认识到疾病不仅是医学问题，更是社会结构、权力关系和殖民历史的反映。尽管意识到了这些深层次的关联，作者承认自己未能及时采取更为激进的行动，如公开批评政府政策或呼吁国际社会关注资源分配不公，这被视为一种失职。尤其在西方已有治疗方案而非洲却因经济负担无法普及治疗的情况下，作者对于未能更早地成为倡导者，未能勇敢地指出药物获取的不平等和潜在的政治经济体系问题对感染率的影响感到深深的内疚和遗憾。\n\n最终，这段反思不仅突显了艾滋病在全球范围内的严重性，也强调了医疗工作者在面对社会不公时的社会责任，对历史错误的深刻反省，对资源分配不公的尖锐批判，以及个人行动与社会变革之间不可分割的联系。通过作者的个人旅程，我们看到了公共卫生领域中希望与挑战并存的真实面貌，以及在推动社会正义和人类福祉方面每个人所承担的责任。",
        "new_tgt_summary": "In 1985, upon relocating to Harare, the author found themselves amidst Zimbabwe's national health policy centered on social justice, marked by free primary healthcare and education, which significantly expanded rural health services, making healthcare accessible to 80% of the population and boosting child immunization rates from 25% in 1980 to 80% by 1990. However, the advent of AIDS in 1985 posed a significant challenge, with infection rates escalating from 2% to one in four adults by 2002. In response, the author and colleagues established a clinic, advocated for condom use, conducted community outreach, performed research, and advised on self-protection measures, all while witnessing the devastating loss of many to the disease. Reflecting on their efforts, the author acknowledges missed opportunities for more impactful interventions, drawing parallels with Kofi Annan's admission of personal mistakes related to the Rwandan genocide. They highlight the realization that more could have been done to address the AIDS crisis, especially considering the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities influenced by social structures such as patriarchy, coerced labor, and colonialism. Despite their focus on patient care and research, the individual regrets not advocating more forcefully against inequalities in accessing life-saving medicines and the role of economic and political systems in driving high infection rates, rationalizing their silence due to fears of expulsion from the country. Despite these challenges, the author feels privileged to have contributed to both the African independence movement and a global public health initiative.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In 1985, upon moving to Harare, the author immersed themselves in Zimbabwe's national health policy focused on social justice, characterized by free primary healthcare and education. This policy significantly improved access to healthcare for 80% of the population, particularly in rural areas, and increased child immunization rates from 25% in 1980 to 80% by 1990. However, the emergence of AIDS in 1985 presented a major challenge, with infection rates rising from 2% to affecting one in four adults by 2002. In response, the author and their colleagues established a clinic, promoted condom use, engaged in community outreach, conducted research, and advised on self-protection measures, while grappling with the devastating impact of the disease. The author reflects on missed opportunities for more effective interventions, noting parallels with Kofi Annan's acknowledgment of personal errors regarding the Rwandan genocide. They express regret for not advocating more strongly against inequalities in accessing life-saving medicines and the role of economic and political systems in exacerbating infection rates, driven by fears of expulsion from the country. Despite these challenges, the author feels honored to have contributed to the African independence movement and a global public health initiative.\n\nThe author is dedicated to their patients and believes that healthcare professionals often underestimate their potential complicity in perpetuating societal issues. Diseases such as AIDS and Ebola are not merely biological occurrences but also symptoms of societal problems including marginalization, exclusion, racism, sexism, and classism. The concept of \"structural violence,\" defined as inequality rooted in societal organization and its detrimental effects on health, is crucial to understanding this connection. The author has been vocal about issues like apartheid, organized racism, and the impact of racism on health in America, linking these to the nation's history of slavery, Jim Crow laws, and ongoing struggles for equality. Serving as the Health Commissioner of New York City, the author points out the city's high premature mortality rate among black individuals and the disproportionately higher risk of pregnancy-related death and infant mortality for black women and infants, issues that mirror broader disparities across the United States. Recent analyses, such as one by the New York Times, further highlight significant disparities in the number of missing black men nationwide, underscoring the pervasive nature of structural violence and its health implications. Throughout their career, the author has strived to recognize and address social injustices, emphasizing the need to raise awareness and guide public health initiatives towards more equitable outcomes.",
