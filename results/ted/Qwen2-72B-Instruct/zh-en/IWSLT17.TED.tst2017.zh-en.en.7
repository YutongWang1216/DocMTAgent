When I was a child, I always fantasized about the ocean.
There, in a riot of colors and brimming with vitality, many creatures that look like alien beings live.
I imagined the great sharks at the top of the food chain, and fantasized about sea turtles dancing gracefully among the coral reefs.
As a photographer who transitioned from being a marine biologist, much of my career has been spent seeking out the places that featured in my childhood fantasies.
As you can see, I started taking to the water on adventures from a very young age.
But my first real dive underwater took place when I was 10 years old.
I can still vividly recall how I paddled hard to reach a rusted cannon barrel lying on the coral reef.
Finally, I managed to reach the cannon barrel, and when I looked up, I found myself surrounded by a school of fish, a rainbow of colors.
Since that day, I fell deeply in love with the ocean.
(Subtitle: Thomas Peschak) (Subtitle: Conservation Photographer) Over the past 40 years, I've had the privilege of exploring the most spectacular seascapes on our planet, contributing to National Geographic and the Save Our Seas Foundation.
My subjects range from giant sharks down to creatures so small they could swim in the palm of your hand.
In the cold waters off the coast of Canada's Great Bear Rainforest, I encountered humpback whales feeding right beside me, their fish-laden breath a memory that lingers.
In the Mozambique Channel, I witnessed the courtship rituals of green sea turtles.
Each and every one of us impacts the ocean, and in turn, is impacted by it.
The pristine oceans of my childhood dreams, however, are becoming increasingly difficult to find.
Their realm is shrinking ever more, and the threats they face are growing.
We humans have always occupied the top of the food chain on this planet, and I have witnessed and documented these behaviors through my camera lens.
For a long time, I believed that only stunning photographs could jolt my audience awake.
Of course, there was an upside to this, which was that it brought me full circle.
I believe the best way to effect change is by spreading love.
I feel like a bridge between people and animals, and as a photographer, I have the rare opportunity to unveil the mysteries of creatures and ecosystems hidden deep in the ocean's depths.
If you don't even know something exists, how can you possibly love it and protect it?
And this is precisely where conservation photographers like myself excel.
I've visited hundreds of different marine environments, but there are only a few sights that have truly left an indelible mark on my memory.
The first time I was struck by such a scene was about a decade ago, off the rugged coastline of South Africa.
Every June and July, countless sardines migrate northward, which we call the "sardine run."
Believe me, these fish have no choice but to do so.
Because there are packs of hungry, agile predators chasing after them.
For example, dolphins that hunt in groups separate a portion of the sardines from the school, corralling them into a ball.
The dolphins drive these sardines closer to the surface, then plunge into the school to feast, relishing this mobile smorgasbord.
Following closely behind are the sharks.
Most people would assume that sharks and dolphins are natural enemies, but during the sardine run, they coexist.
In fact, with the dolphins' assistance, the sharks enjoy an even more satisfying feast.
Without the dolphins herding them, the sardines struggle to form a tight ball, and sharks often swim right through the middle of the school, like a knife through a doughnut, sometimes ending up with just a bellyful of water.
I've had several close encounters with shark packs during the sardine run, and I know that they don't see me as a threat.
But I still get bumped and brushed by tails, just like the other guests at this raucous feast.
We sail eastward from the African coastline, across the vast Indian Ocean, to the Maldivesâ€”a collection of islands formed by coral reefs.
During the stormy Southwest Monsoon season, manta rays that inhabit the atoll waters congregate near Hanifaru, a small island in Baa Atoll.
Swarms of tiny shrimp and crabs, most smaller than our pupils, form the primary diet of manta rays.
When these plankton are more scattered, manta rays typically feed alone, rolling continuously in the water like puppies chasing their own tails.
And when the plankton accumulate in greater numbers, the manta rays begin to form long feeding lines, connecting head to tail, with the tasty morsels missed by the leading manta ray being scooped up by its trailing companions.
As the plankton in the bay accumulate in greater numbers, the manta rays draw closer together in formation, employing this unique feeding technique, which we call the "tornado feeding method."
The manta rays stack up, forming a tight spiral that creates a vortex, trapping the plankton and directing it straight into the manta rays' enormous mouths.
Diving among hundreds of manta rays is a sight I will never forget.
When I first went to Hanifaru to take photos, the area was not yet protected, and the ecosystem was threatened by local development.
By working with non-governmental organizations like the Manta Trust, my photographs ultimately helped secure Hanifaru's designation as a marine protected area.
Fishermen from nearby islands used to hunt many manta rays, using their skin to make traditional drums.
And now, they have become the most staunch protectors of the manta rays, which generate over $8 million annually for the Maldives.
I often wish I could go back to a time when most of the map was blank or marked "here be dragons."
The closest thing so far to what I've experienced are some remote atolls in the western Indian Ocean.
Diving there, far from fishing grounds and boats, always fills me with melancholy, as it reminds me of what the ocean once was.
Few have heard of Inde Reef, a tiny coral atoll located in the Mozambique Channel.
The outer reef forms a protective barrier, and the lagoon within serves as a nursery for Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are never shy, not even during the day.
I suspect they become even more active and abundant at night.
I had never seen so many sharks in a coral atoll lagoon before.
Recording and sharing moments like these constantly remind me of the reasons why I chose this path.
Earlier this year, to fulfill a contract with National Geographic, I traveled to the Baja California Peninsula.
On the Pacific side of the peninsula's midsection lies San Ignacio Lagoon, a crucial breeding ground for gray whales.
Over the past century, this coastline was a massive slaughterhouse, with over 20,000 gray whales killed here, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
And now, the descendants of these gray whales push their calves to the surface to play, frolic, and even interact with us.
This species has made a remarkable recovery.
On the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo, a tranquil little fishing village.
Decades of overfishing had once pushed this village to the brink of bankruptcy.
In 1995, the local fishermen convinced the government to designate these waters as a marine protected area.
What unfolded next could be described as nothing short of a miracle.
In 2005, just a decade after the protection measures were implemented, scientists found that the local fish populations had recovered to record-breaking levels.
See for yourself, come with me.
Take a deep breath and dive with me into the depths, to witness what the largest and densest schools of fish I've ever encountered look like.
We all have the power to create hope.
I want my photographs to convey a message: it's not too late to save our oceans, starting from now.
I particularly wish to highlight nature's resilience, even in the face of 7.3 billion humans.
I hope that in the years to come, it will become increasingly difficult for me to capture images like these, and instead, I'll be taking more photos that reflect a harmonious coexistence between people and the ocean.
I truly wish I could take pictures like this every single day.
To make it in this line of work, you have to be a hopeless optimist.
I always shoot with the assumption that the next great image, the one that could make a difference, is just out there waiting for me, perhaps behind the next coral reef, in the next lagoon, or if not, then the one after that.
