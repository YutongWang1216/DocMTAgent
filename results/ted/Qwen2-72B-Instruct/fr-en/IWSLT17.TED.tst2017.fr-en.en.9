Raising hands: how many of you have ever unfriended someone on Facebook because they made an offensive comment about politics, religion, parenting, food?
How many of you avoid at least one person just to not have to talk to them?
Before, to have a polite conversation, we followed Henry Higgins' advice in "My Fair Lady": stick to the weather and health.
But these days, with climate change and the anti-vaccination movement, these topics... aren't very safe anymore.
The world in which we live, this world where any conversation can potentially evolve into controversy, where our politicians can't speak to each other, and where even the most trivial topics have their proponents and detractors, this world is not normal.
Pew Research conducted a study on 10,000 American adults and found that, currently, we are more polarized, more divided, than ever before.
We make fewer compromises, which means we're not listening to each other.
We decide where to live, who to marry, and even who will be our friends, based on our already established beliefs.
Once again, this doesn't mean that we don't listen to each other.
A conversation requires a balance between speaking and listening, and somewhere along the way, we've lost that balance.
This is partly due to technology.
The cell phones you all have, either in your hands or close enough to grab quickly.
According to Pew Research, about one third of American teenagers send over 100 text messages per day.
Many of them, in fact the majority, will likely send a text message to their friends rather than talk to them face to face.
There's a great article in the magazine "The Atlantic"
written by Paul Barnwell, a high school teacher.
His students have done a communication project.
He wanted to teach them to speak about a particular subject without notes.
He said this: "I realized..."
"I realized that the ability to hold a conversation might be the most neglected skill to teach."
Children spend hours conversing and sharing ideas through screens, but they rarely get the opportunity to refine their interpersonal communication skills.
It may seem strange, but we must ask: in the 21st century, what skill is more important than knowing how to hold a coherent conversation?
My job is to talk to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers.
I speak to people I like and to others I don't like.
I speak to people with whom I fundamentally disagree.
But I always have fantastic conversations with them.
During the next 10 minutes, I would like to teach you to speak and to listen.
Many of you have already heard advice on this: look people in the eye, think ahead about interesting topics to discuss, look, nod your head and smile to show your attentiveness, repeat what you've heard or summarize it.
Forget all of that.
This is bullshit.
There is no need to learn to demonstrate that you are attentive, if you are actually attentive.
I use exactly the same skills as a professional interviewer in my daily life.
I am going to teach you how to question people, and this will help you learn how to be better communicators.
Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time, without getting bored, and above all, without offending anyone.
We have all had extraordinary conversations at some point.
We've had them. We know what it's like.
The kind of conversation that makes you feel engaged and inspired, or that gives you the impression of having truly created a connection, or of having been perfectly understood.
There is no reason why most of our conversations should not be like that.
I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to explain them to you, but honestly, if you take just one and fully master it, you'll already be having better conversations.
Number 1: No multitasking.
Not just setting down your phone, your tablet, or your car keys, or whatever you have in your hand.
Be present.
Live in the moment.
Don't think about the argument with your boss,
nor to what you're going to eat tonight.
If you want to end the conversation, do so, but don't be only half-present.
Number 2: Don't give a lesson.
If you want to give your opinion without any opportunity to respond, discuss, react, or grow, write a blog.
I have a very good reason not to invite critics to my show: they are incredibly boring.
Conservatives will hate Obama, food stamps, and abortion.
Liberals will hate big banks, the oil industry, and Dick Cheney.
Completely predictable.
You don't want to be like that.
You must start every conversation with the idea that you're going to learn something.
Scott Peck, the renowned therapist, said that for true listening, one must vanish.
That means sometimes setting aside your own opinion.
He said that the speaker will sense this acceptance, and become less vulnerable, more likely to reveal the hidden corners of his mind to the listener.
Consider that you have things to learn.
Bill Nye: "Every person knows something that you don't."
I put it this way: everyone is an expert in something.
Number 3: Ask open-ended questions.
For this, take inspiration from journalists.
Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why, or how.
If you ask a complex question, the answer will be simple.
If I ask you: "Were you terrified?"
you will respond to the most powerful word in this sentence, here "terrified," and the answer will be yes or no.
"Were you angry?" "Yes, very angry."
Let them describe it. They are the ones who know.
Ask questions such as: "What was it like?"
"What did you feel?"
Because they may need a moment to think, and you will then get a much more interesting response.
Number 4: Follow the flow.
This means that ideas will come to your mind and you must let them out of your head.
We often hear interviews where the guest speaks for several minutes, then the host jumps in and asks a question that seems to come out of nowhere, or to which an answer has already been given.
The host probably stopped listening two minutes earlier because he was thinking about his next question, a very smart question that he was determined to ask.
We do the same thing.
We are sitting, talking to someone, and then we remember our encounter with Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.
We stop listening.
Stories and ideas will come to you.
You must let them come, then go away.
Number 5: if you don't know, say that you don't know.
People on the radio, particularly on NPR, are more aware that what they say is being recorded; hence, they are more cautious when discussing their expertise and what they are sure of knowing.
Do the same. Err on the side of caution.
Words should not be taken lightly.
Number 6: do not compare your experience to theirs.
If they talk about the loss of a family member, don't talk about the loss of a family member of yours.
If they talk about the problems they have at work, don't tell them that you hate your job.
It's not the same thing, ever.
Every experience is unique.
More importantly, it's not about you.
There's no need to use this moment to prove how great you are or how much you've suffered.
Someone asked Stephen Hawking his IQ, to which he replied: "No idea. Those who brag about their IQ are losers."
Conversations are not promotional opportunities.
Number 7: try not to repeat yourself.
It's condescending and very boring, and we tend to do it.
Especially during work conversations, or with our children, we have a message to get across so we tirelessly rephrase it.
Don't do it.
Number 8: Spare the details.
Frankly, regardless of the years, the names, the dates, and all these details that you just can't remember.
It doesn't matter. What matters is you.
People are interested in you, in what you have in common.
Forget the details. Set them aside.
Number 9: it's not the last, but it's the most important.
Listen.
I cannot tell you how many significant people have said that listening may be the most important skill to develop.
Buddha said, and I paraphrase: "If your mouth is open, you're not learning."
And Calvin Coolidge said: "No one was ever fired for listening."
Why don't we listen to each other?
Firstly, we prefer to talk.
When I speak, I am in control.
I don't have to listen to what doesn't interest me.
I am the center of attention.
I can highlight my identity.
But it's not just that: we allow ourselves to be distracted.
We speak an average of 225 words per minute, but we can listen to up to 500.
So our minds fill in with another 275 words.
I know it takes effort and energy to pay attention to someone, but if you don't do it, it's not a conversation,
but rather two people shouting barely connected sentences in the same place.
You must listen to each other.
Stephen Covey put it very well:
"Many of us do not listen to understand.
We listen to reply."
One last rule, number 10: be brief.
[A good conversation is like a miniskirt: short enough to hold attention, yet long enough to cover the subject. -- My sister] It all boils down to a fundamental concept: take an interest in others.
I grew up with a very famous grandfather and there was a ritual in my home.
People would come to talk to my grandparents and after they left, my mother would come to us and say, "Do you know who that was?
That was the Miss America finalist.
That was the mayor of Sacramento.
She won a Pulitzer Prize. He is a Russian ballet dancer.
I grew up believing that everyone has a hidden and truly amazing side.
I believe that makes me a better hostess.
I keep my mouth shut as much as possible, I keep my mind open, and I am always ready to be amazed, and I am never disappointed.
Do the same.
Go talk to people, listen to them, and above all, be ready to be amazed.
Thank you.
