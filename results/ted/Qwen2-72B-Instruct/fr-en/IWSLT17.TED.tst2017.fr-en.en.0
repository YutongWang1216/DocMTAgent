It's a story about how we know what we know.
It's a story about this woman Natalia Rybczynski.
She is a paleobiologist, which means she specializes in unearthing old dead stuff.
Natalia Rybczynski: Yes, sometimes, I've been called "Dr. Dead Things".
Latif Nasser: I think she's interesting because of where she works, way up above the Arctic Circle in the isolated tundra of Canada.
One summer day in 2006, she was at a dig site called Fyles Leaf Bed, which is less than 10 degrees of latitude from the magnetic North Pole.
NR: Honestly, it doesn't sound thrilling, because it was a day of hiking with a backpack, a GPS, and a notebook, and we were picking up anything that could be a fossil.
LN: And at one point, she noticed something.
NR: Rusty, rust-colored, as big as the palm of my hand.
It was just lying on the ground.
LN: And at first, she thought it was just a splinter, like those found at Fyles Leaf Bed before - fragments of prehistoric plants.
But that night, back at camp, ...
NR: ... I pull out a magnifying glass, I look at it more closely and I realize that it doesn't have the growth rings of a tree.
Maybe it's the preservation, but it really looks like...
a bone.
LN: So, over the next four years, she returned to this site repeatedly, and in the end she collected 30 fragments of the same bone, most of them very small.
NR: It's not that much. It fits into a little plastic bag.
LN: And she tried to piece them together like a puzzle.
But it was exhilarating.
NR: It's all broken into so many little pieces, I try with sand and putty, but in vain.
So finally, we used a 3D surface scanner.
LN: Ooh! NR: Yes, exactly.
LN: But it was easier to do it virtually.
NR: It's a bit magical when it all comes together.
LN: How did you know it was right, that they were put together correctly?
Could they have been assembled differently to form a parrot or something else?
NR: Well, no. No, it could only be that.
LN: She found out that what she had was a tibia, a leg bone, and specifically, the bone of a cloven-hoofed mammal, so something like a cow or a sheep.
But it couldn't have been one of those.
It was just too big.
NR: The size of this thing was huge. It's a very large animal.
LN: So, what kind of animal could it be?
Stumped, she showed one of the fragments to her colleagues in Colorado, and they had an idea.
NR: We took a saw, and we just made a notch on the edge, and there was this very interesting smell coming out of it.
LN: It smelled like burnt flesh.
It was a smell Natalia recognized after dissecting quite a few skulls in her disgusting anatomy lab: collagen.
Collagen is what gives our bones their structure.
And generally, after so many years, it breaks down.
But in this case, the Arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it.
A year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol, and she saw that one of her colleagues, Mike Buckley, was presenting a new method called "collagen fingerprinting."
It turns out that all species have slightly different collagen structures, so if we have the collagen profile of an unknown bone, we can compare it to that of known species, and who knows, maybe they match.
So she sent him one of the fragments, via FedEx.
NR: Yes, we wanted to follow up on it. It was quite important.
LN: He studied it, and he compared it to 37 known modern mammal species.
And he found a match.
It turns out that the 3.5 million-year-old bone Natalia unearthed from the High Arctic belonged to...
a camel.
NR: And I thought to myself: "This is great -- if it's true."
LN: They tested several fragments and they got the same result every time.
However, based on the size of the bone they found, this camel seemed to be 30% larger than modern camels.
So this camel would have stood almost 2.8 meters tall, and weighed nearly a ton.
And yes.
Natalia had found a giant Arctic camel.
Well, when you hear the word "camel", what should come to mind is one of these, the Bactrian camel from East and Central Asia.
But it's possible that what comes to your mind is a postcard image like this, the dromedary, the typical desert animal -- living in the sand of hot places, like the Middle East or the Sahara, with a big hump on its back where it stores water for its long journeys, and with large, wide feet that help it traverse sand dunes.
So, how do we explain that one of them ended up in the Far Arctic?
In fact, scientists had known for a long time, even before Natalia's discovery, that camels are originally American.
They started here.
For 40 of the 45 million years since camels have existed, they could only be found in North America, approximately 20 different species, perhaps more.
If we aligned them all, would we see differences?
NR: Yes, the bodies would have had different sizes.
You'll have some with very long necks, which will actually be like giraffes.
LN: Some had snouts, like crocodiles.
NR: The most primitive ones would have been very small, almost like rabbits.
LN: What? Rabbits-sized camels?
NR: The oldest ones.
So you probably wouldn't recognize them.
LN: Damn, I want a rabbit-camel.
NR: I know, that would be awesome.
LN: And three to seven million years ago, a branch of camels went down into South America, where they became llamas and alpacas, and another branch crossed the Bering land bridge into Asia and Africa.
And at the end of the last ice age, the North American camels went extinct.
So scientists already knew all this, but it doesn't really explain why Natalia found one so far north.
Because, in terms of temperature, it's the exact opposite of the Sahara.
To be honest, 3.5 million years ago, the average temperature was 22Â°C warmer than it is today.
So there would have been a boreal forest, more like today's Yukon or Siberia.
But still, they would have had winters lasting 6 months during which the ponds were frozen.
There would have been blizzards.
There would have been 24-hour days completely shrouded in darkness.
So, how... How?
How could one of these Sahara superstars have survived in this Arctic environment?
Natalia and her colleagues think they have an answer.
And it's pretty awesome.
And what if the traits that allowed the camel to so perfectly adapt to places like the Sahara, actually evolved to help it endure the winter?
And what if these broad feet were made, not for walking on sand, but in the snow, like a pair of snowshoes?
And what if this hump -- which, by the way, in a major newsflash for me, doesn't contain water but fat -- was there to help the camel survive those six-month winters, when food is scarce?
And then, only later, after crossing the land bridge, did he use these features to adapt to the scorching deserts?
For instance, the hump may be advantageous for camels in desert climates because having all their fat in one place, like a backpack of fat, means they don't have that insulating layer on the rest of their body.
So the heat dissipates more easily.
It's this crazy idea that the camel's attributes, which we believe prove its desert nature, might in fact be evidence of its Arctic past.
So, I am not the first to tell this story.
Some have discussed it to embellish the biology of evolution or to provide insight into the future of climate change.
But I love it for every other reason.
For me, it's a story about us, about how we see the world and how that perspective changes.
I have a degree in history.
And I've learned that actually many scientists are also historians.
They give meaning to the past.
They tell the story of our universe, of our planet, of life on it.
And as a historian, one starts with a certain idea of how history unfolds.
NR: We create stories and that's all, just like the camel in the desert.
It's a great story! It fits well with the idea.
They apparently always lived there.
LN: But at any moment, we can discover a tiny piece of evidence.
We can learn a little fact that will force us to rethink everything we thought we knew.
For example, in this case, there is a scientist who finds this shard thinking it's a piece of wood, and because of that, science has a completely new and really counterintuitive theory that shows why this creature, seeming to come out of Dr. Seuss's drawings, is what it is.
And for me, it has completely changed the way I see the camel.
He has gone from being this ridiculous creature, adapted only to a specific environment, to this great traveler who has just arrived in the Sahara, and who could theoretically arrive anywhere.
Here is Azuri.
Azuri, hello, how are you?
Ok, hold on, I have this for you.
Azuri is on vacation, usually he is at his concerts at the Radio City Music Hall.
It's not even a joke.
In short -- Azuri is here as living proof, to remind us that the history of our world is dynamic.
Only our willingness can help us to readjust, to reinvent it.
Isn't that so, Azuri?
And truly, we are all one bone fragment away from seeing the world differently.
Thank you very much.
