Doubtless you have never heard of Kenema in Sierra Leone, or Arua in Nigeria.
For me, these are the two most extraordinary places on Earth.
There, in the hospitals, there is a community of nurses, doctors, and scientists who have calmly fought one of humanity's deadliest threats for years: the Lassa virus.
The Lassa virus is similar to the Ebola virus.
It can cause a high fever and is often fatal.
But these individuals risk their lives every day, to protect the people in their communities, and ultimately, to protect all of us.
One of the most extraordinary things I learned about them, during one of my early visits long ago, was that they start each morning - those tough mornings on the front lines - by singing.
They come together, and they show their joy and their strength.
Over the years, we have visited each other. I could be among them, sing, and write. It was extraordinary, because it reminded us that we are not there solely for the sake of science, but that we are bound by a shared humanity.
You can imagine, it's extremely important, even vital, when things started to change.
The situation changed in March 2014, when the Ebola epidemic was declared in Guinea.
This was the first epidemic in West Africa, near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
It was terrifying... We were all terrified.
We had suspected for some time that the Lassa and Ebola viruses were more widespread than people thought, that they could reach Kenema.
Then, members of my team immediately joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team on the ground. We set up diagnostics to perform molecular tests capable of detecting the arrival of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
We had already succeeded in controlling the Lassa virus. We knew how to do it, the team was remarkable.
We simply had to give them the tools and the lab for Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day arrived.
On May 23, 2014, a woman arrived at the maternity ward of the hospital. The team performed the molecular tests and identified the first case of the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone.
This was exceptional work.
They were able to diagnose the case immediately, treat the patient safely, and begin to understand what was happening.
It could have prevented what happened.
But on the day it happened, the epidemic had been brewing for several months.
There were already hundreds of cases, surpassing all previous outbreaks.
She entered Sierra Leone not as an isolated case, but as a tidal wave.
We worked with the international community, the Ministry of Health, and with Kenema, to treat the cases. The following week there were 31, then 92, then 147 cases, all coming to Kenema, one of the few places in Sierra Leone that could handle this issue.
We worked tirelessly, trying everything possible to help every individual, and attempting to draw attention. We also did something else:
we didn't discard the blood tests, used to detect Ebola, we placed them in a chemical to deactivate them. We packed them and shipped them across the ocean.
We sent them to Boston, where my team works.
We also worked tirelessly, day after day. We rapidly generated 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
The genome is the blueprint of a virus.
We all have one.
It reveals what we are made of, and it passes on so much information about us.
The results of this kind of work are straightforward and highly useful.
We took these 99 different viruses, observed and compared them, and we found that, by comparing them to the three genomes previously published in Guinea, the epidemic had emerged in Guinea several months earlier, and that, once in humans, it was transmitted from human to human.
This is crucial when determining how to intervene, because contact tracing is essential.
We also discovered that the virus mutated as it moved between humans.
Every mutation is significant because diagnostics, vaccines, and our therapies are all based on the genome sequence. It's the blueprint.
Global health experts need to respond, develop, and recalibrate all their work accordingly.
But science doesn't work that way. My position at the time was that I had the data and I could have worked in isolation for months, analyzing the data carefully, slowly, submitting a paper for publication, making a few revisions, and finally releasing my data post-publication.
This is how the status quo in science operates.
This time, there was no question of acting in such a manner.
We had friends on the ground. For us, it was clear that we needed help, a lot of help...
The first thing we did, as soon as the machine produced the first sequences, was to publish them on the web.
We published them and issued a call for help.
And the help came!
Quickly, many people contacted us, surprised by the data we had published.
Some of the world's leading infectious disease specialists were part of our community.
We were working together virtually, sharing regular calls, trying to track the virus minute by minute, to see how to stop it.
There are so many ways to form such communities.
Everyone, as the epidemic began to spread globally, wanted to learn, participate, and engage.
Everyone wanted to play a role.
The number of volunteers was amazing, and the Internet connected us all.
Can you imagine, instead of being afraid of each other, we said: "OK, let's do this, by working together,
we will defeat this virus."
The problem was that the data we were using, by conducting web-based research, were too limited for our purpose.
We waste a lot of opportunities in these cases.
So, when the epidemic broke out in Kenema, we had 106 clinical patient files, and we made them public.
In our lab, we demonstrated that, armed with these 106 records, we could train our computers to predict Ebola with an accuracy of around 100%.
We developed an application that provides access to this information to the healthcare staff on site.
Unfortunately, 106 cases are not sufficient to consolidate and validate the data.
So we were waiting for more data.
But we were still waiting for the data.
We are still waiting, confined in our silos, instead of working together.
This situation is no longer tolerable.
You, all of you, can no longer accept this.
It's our lives that are at stake.
Many people lost their lives, healthcare workers, including dear colleagues of mine. Five colleagues lost their lives: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Koroma, and Mohamed Fullah.
These are just five among many others at Kenema and beyond, who died while the world waited and we worked, quietly and separately.
Ebola, like all threats to humanity, is fueled by mistrust, confusion, and division.
While we build barriers between us, the virus thrives.
Unlike all other threats, in the face of Ebola, we are all equal.
We are all in the same boat.
Ebola is at all of our doorsteps.
And so in this place, we share the same vulnerabilities, strengths, fears, and hopes, I wish that we can work together and with pleasure. 
One of my former students was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and she found out that the term "Kenema," the hospital where we work in Sierra Leone, comes from the Mende phrase meaning "clear as a river, translucent and open to sight."
This held a special significance for us, because, unbeknownst to us, we had always believed that to honor the individuals in Kenema, we had to work openly and together.
We must do it.
We must all demand of ourselves and others to be open to one another when an epidemic occurs, and to fight it together.
Because this is neither the first nor the last Ebola epidemic, and there are many other pathogens lurking around us, such as the Lassa virus.
The next epidemic could strike a city of millions.
It could start there and be transmitted by air.
It could even be disseminated intentionally.
I know it's frightening, I understand... but I also know, this experience proves it, that we have the technology and the ability to conquer, to conquer and get ahead of other viruses.
But this is only possible if we collaborate in joy.
For Dr. Khan, and for all those who gave their lives, on the front lines, in this fight alongside us, let us stand by them in this struggle. Always.
Let's not leave the world with the scars of destruction wrought by a virus. Let's illuminate it with the brilliance of billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
Thank you.
