Sometimes, I feel ashamed to be a European.
Last year, over a million people in need of our help arrived in Europe and our response was frankly pathetic.
There are so many contradictions.
We mourn the tragic death of Alan Kurdi, a two-year-old child, and yet, since then, over 200 children have drowned in the Mediterranean.
International treaties recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility, and yet we accept that little Lebanon hosts more Syrians than all of Europe combined.
We lament the existence of smugglers, yet we make them the only viable route for seeking asylum in Europe.
We are short of labor, and yet we prevent people who fit our economic and demographic needs from coming to Europe.
We proclaim our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist Islam, yet -- we have enforcement policies that detain minor asylum seekers, separate children from their families, and seize the belongings of refugees.
What are we doing?
How did we get to the point where we adopt such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis?
I do not believe it is due to indifference, at least I do not want to believe that.
I believe it's because our politicians lack vision, they don't know how to adapt the international asylum rules, created over 50 years ago, to globalization.
I want to take a step back and ask two fundamental questions, the two questions that we must all ask.
Firstly, why doesn't the current system work?
Secondly, how can we remedy this?
The current system for refugees was created in response to the consequences of World War II by these people.
Its primary goal is to ensure that when a state fails, or worse, turns against its own people, there is a place for them to go, where they can live in safety and with dignity until they can return home.
It was specifically created for situations like the current one in Syria.
Through an international convention signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Refugee Status Convention, and an international organization, the UNHCR, states have committed to mutually admit onto their territory individuals fleeing conflict and persecution.
But today, this system is failing.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In practice, our immigration policies block the path to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to integration or return to their country of origin.
But in practice, they remain trapped in eternal limbo.
In theory, refugees are a shared global responsibility.
In practice, geography dictates that countries close to the conflict host the overwhelming majority of refugees.
The system isn't broken because the rules are bad
but because we do not apply them adequately to a changing world, and that is what we must reconsider.
I will explain to you how the current system works.
How does the current system for refugees work?
But not from an institutional perspective, rather from the viewpoint of a refugee.
Imagine a Syrian woman. Let's call her Amira.
For me, Amira represents
many people I have met in the region.
Amira, like 25% of refugees worldwide, is a woman with children, and she cannot return home because she comes from that city you see: Homs. A city that was beautiful and historic and is now in ruins.
Amira cannot go back there.
But Amira has no hope of settling in a third country, because there is a lottery available to only less than 1% of refugees.
Amira and her family face an impossible choice.
They have three options.
The first option is that Amira takes her family to a camp.
In the camp, she might receive help, but there is little future for Amira and her family.
The camps are in harsh and barren locations, often in the desert.
In the Zaatari camp in Jordan, at night, you hear the bombings on the other side of the border.
Economic activity is restricted.
The education is often of poor quality.
Around the world, approximately 80% of refugees living in camps must remain there for at least 5 years.
It's a miserable life, and that's probably why, in reality, only 9% of Syrians choose this option.
An alternative for Amira is to head for the urban area of a neighboring country, such as Amman or Beirut.
This is an option chosen by about 75% of Syrian refugees.
But it also entails difficulties.
Refugees in such urban areas often lack the right to work.
They often lack access to assistance.
And so when Amira and her family have spent all their savings, they will have nothing left and will be in urban destitution.
There is a third possibility that an increasing number of Syrians are choosing.
Amira can seek hope for her family by risking their lives on a perilous journey to another country, and this is what we are seeing today in Europe.
We therefore offer refugees an almost impossible choice between three options: the camp, urban destitution, or a perilous journey.
For refugees, this choice is the refugee regime of today.
But I believe this is a false choice.
We can reconsider this choice.
The reason we restrict these options is because we believe they are the only possible choices for refugees, but that is not true.
Policies view this as a zero-sum game, if we benefit the refugees, citizens pay the price.
We tend to think of refugees as an inevitable cost or a burden on society.
But they don't have to be. They can contribute.
What I mean is, there are ways to increase opportunities so that everyone benefits: host countries and communities, our societies, and the refugees.
And I want to suggest four ways to transform our perception of refugees.
These four perspectives have one thing in common: they embrace the opportunities of globalization, mobility, and markets, and modernize our approach to the refugee issue.
The first idea is that of conducive environments. This begins with the fundamental recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but with extraordinary circumstances.
Together with my colleagues from Oxford, we embarked on a research project in Uganda, observing the economic lives of refugees.
We chose Uganda, not because it is representative of all host countries.
He is exceptional.
Unlike most host countries, Uganda has provided economic opportunities to refugees.
It grants them the right to work, the freedom to move.
And the results are extraordinary, for the refugees and for the host community.
In the capital, Kampala, we found that 21% of refugees own a business that employs people, and 40% of these employees are natives of the host country.
In other words, refugees are creating jobs for the citizens of the host country.
Even in the camps, we have found remarkable examples of dynamic and thriving businesses.
For instance, in a village called Nakivale, we have the example of Congolese refugees running digital music sharing businesses.
We have found a Rwandan who runs a business enabling young people to play video games on recycled consoles and televisions.
Despite the hardships imposed by extreme constraints, refugees innovate, and the man you see is a Congolese named Demou-Kay.
Demou-Kay arrived at the camp with very few possessions, but he wanted to become a director.
So, with friends and colleagues, he launched a community radio station, rented a camera, and began making films.
He has made two documentaries with and for our team, and he is building a thriving business with virtually nothing.
It is examples like these that should guide our response to refugees.
Instead of viewing refugees as inevitably dependent on humanitarian aid, we must provide them with the opportunity for human development.
Yes, clothing, blankets, shelter, food are crucial during the emergency phase, but we must strive for more.
We must provide the opportunity for connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, access to banks.
Everything we take for granted, that integrates us into the global economy, can and should be offered to refugees.
The second idea I want to discuss is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all the host countries in the world have the approach that Uganda has.
Most host countries do not open their economy to refugees in this way.
But there are always practical options that we can use.
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, development economist Paul Collier, and we worked on an idea that we conceived there with the international community and the government, an idea to create jobs for Syrians while supporting Jordan's national development strategy.
It's the concept of an economic zone where we could potentially integrate employment for refugees as well as employment for the host country's natives.
Fifteen minutes from the Zaatari camp, which hosts 83,000 refugees, there is the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Zone.
The government has spent over $100 million connecting it to the electrical grid and road network, but two things were missing: access to labor and foreign investment.
so that refugees can work there instead of being stuck in camps, support their families, develop skills through vocational training before returning to Syria.
We acknowledged that Jordan would benefit, its development strategy requiring the transition from a middle-income country to an industrialized one.
Refugees would benefit, but it would also contribute to the reconstruction of Syria after the war, acknowledging that we must nurture refugees because they are the best resource for rebuilding Syria.
We published this idea in the journal Foreign Affairs.
King Abdullah has taken up the idea.
This was announced at the London conference on Syria and a pilot program will begin during the summer.
The third idea I want to put forward is the concept of preference deals between states and refugees leading to positive outcomes, as you see in this selfie featuring Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee.
We rarely ask refugees what they want, where they want to go, but we can do so and it will be better for everyone.
The economist Alvin Roth has developed the concept of market matching, where the order of preference of the parties determines their potential pairing.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym have explored ways to apply this idea to refugees, asking refugees to rank destinations while also allowing states to rank the type of refugees they prefer based on skill or language criteria, and then match them accordingly.
Of course, diversity and vulnerability quotas would need to be established, but this is a way to increase the likelihood of successful matches.
The matching concept is successfully employed in various contexts, such as allocating students to universities, pairing kidney donors with patients, and it is featured on dating websites as well.
Why not apply this to offer choice to refugees?
This could also be applied at the national level, where one of the biggest challenges is convincing local communities to accept refugees.
Currently, for example, in my country, we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to cities, which makes no sense.
Matching markets allow for the alignment of these preferences, listening to the needs and demands of both the host population and the refugees.
The fourth idea I want to discuss is the principle of humanitarian visas.
The tragedies and disorders observed in Europe could have been avoided.
They stem from a fundamental contradiction in Europe's asylum policy: to claim asylum in Europe, one must自发ly embark on a perilous journey I've already discussed. 
But why are such journeys necessary in the era of low-cost airlines and modern consular means?
These journeys are not necessary and, last year, they led to the death of over 3,000 people at the borders of Europe and on European territory.
If refugees had the right to travel directly and apply for asylum in Europe, we would avoid this. And we can achieve this through humanitarian visas that allow individuals to obtain a visa from an embassy or consulate in a neighboring country and then pay for their ferry or plane ride to Europe.
It costs around 1,000 € to pay a smuggler from Turkey to the Greek islands.
A low-cost flight from Bodrum to Frankfurt costs 200 €.
If we allowed refugees, it would have major benefits.
This would save lives, it would diminish the market for smugglers, and it would mark the end of the disorder observed on the front lines of European entry points, such as the Greek islands.
It is the laws that prevent us from doing so, not a rational solution.
This is an idea that has been implemented.
Brazil has adopted a forward-thinking approach, with over 2,000 Syrians obtaining humanitarian visas, traveling to Brazil, and upon arrival, applying for refugee status.
In this setup, every Syrian who did this was granted refugee status and recognized as a refugee.
There is a historical precedent.
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports were used as travel documents allowing 450,000 Assyrians, Turks, and Chechens to travel to Europe and apply for refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
And the Nansen International Office for Refugees received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this viable strategy.
Each of these four ideas that I have presented to you are ways to expand Amira's choices.
These are means by which we can increase the choices for refugees beyond these options, these three impossible options that I have detailed, while benefiting others as well.
In conclusion, we need a new perspective, a vision that expands the choices for refugees but acknowledges that they do not have to be a burden.
There is nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost.
Yes, they are a humanitarian responsibility, but they are human beings with skills, talents, aspirations, and the ability to contribute, if we allow them to.
In the new world, migration will not stop.
What we have seen in Europe will continue for years.
People will still travel, populations will be displaced, and we must find rational and realistic ways to manage this, not based on outdated logics of humanitarian aid and charity, but built on the opportunities offered by globalization, markets, and mobility.
I urge you to wake up and I urge our politicians to wake up to this challenge.
Thank you very much.
