I come from one of the most liberal, tolerant, progressive places in the United States: Seattle, in the state of Washington.
I grew up with a family of great Seattlites.
My mother was an artist, my father a university professor, and I am grateful for my upbringing because I have always been completely comfortable living my life as I saw fit.
In fact, I took a path that was not what my parents had envisioned.
At 19, I dropped out of university -- dropped out, got fired, splitting hairs.
I hit the road as a professional horn player, which was my lifelong dream.
I played chamber music across the United States and Europe, and I toured for 2 years with a great jazz musician: Charlie Bird.
Approaching 30, I ended up a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra.
What a life!
My parents never complained.
They supported me all the way.
It was not their dream.
They told their neighbors and friends: "Our son is taking a sabbatical decade."
And -- However, there has been an awkward conversation about my lifestyle that I would like to tell you about.
I was 27, I had returned from Barcelona, I was at my parents' house for Christmas, I was preparing dinner with my mother and we were alone in the kitchen.
And she was silent, too silent.
Something was off.
I said, "Mom, what are you thinking about?"
She said, "Your father and I are worried about you."
I said, "What?" What could it be?
And she said, "I want you to be completely honest: did you vote Republican?"
In fact, I wasn't very political, I was just a horn player.
I had an epiphany, they had noticed it and it was causing confusion.
I had become a capitalist enthusiast and I want to explain to you what that means.
This stemmed from my lifelong interest in, believe it or not, poverty.
When I was a child, growing up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw real poverty.
We were a lower middle-class family, but of course, that's not real poverty.
It's far from it.
The first time I saw poverty and its face, I was 6 or 7 years old, in the early 70s.
And, like many of you, it was a mundane and commonplace example.
It was a photograph in National Geographic of a child my age in East Africa, there were flies on his face and a bloated belly.
He wasn't going to make it, I knew, and I was powerless.
Some of you remember this image, not exactly this one, but a similar one.
She revealed stark poverty to the West.
This vision haunted me as I grew up, went to school, dropped out, did something else, and started a family.
And I wondered what had happened to that child
or to others like him all around the world.
I studied, even though I wasn't at university, I was looking for an answer: what was happening to the poorest people in the world?
Was it getting worse, was it improving? What?
I found the answer and it changed my life, and I want to share it with you.
See -- most Americans believe that poverty has worsened since our childhood since they saw that picture.
Ask Americans how poverty worldwide has evolved, 70% will say that hunger in the world has worsened since the early 70s.
But here is the truth.
Here is the epiphany that changed the way I think.
Between the 70s and today, the percentage of the world's population living in famine, living on less than a dollar a day, adjusted for inflation, that percentage has dropped by 80%.
There has been an 80% reduction in the most severe global poverty since my childhood.
And I didn't even know it.
This, my friends, is a miracle.
We must celebrate it.
This is the greatest anti-poverty success story in the history of humanity, and it is happening in our lifetime.
When I learned this, I asked: what made this possible, what allowed this to happen?
For if you do not know why, you cannot do it again.
If you want to do it again and lift the next two billion out of poverty, because that's what we're talking about: since my childhood, two billion of those, our brothers and sisters, have been lifted out of poverty.
I want the next two billion, so I need to know why.
I looked for an answer.
It wasn't political, because I didn't care.
I still don't care.
I wanted the best answer from traditional economists on the left, right, and center.
Here it is.
Here are the reasons.
These are the five reasons why two billion of our brothers and sisters have been lifted out of poverty since my childhood.
The first: globalization.
The second: free trade.
The third: property rights.
The fourth: the rule of law.
The fifth: entrepreneurship.
It was the spread of the free enterprise system around the world after 1970 that did this.
I am not naive.
I know that free enterprise is not perfect and that free enterprise alone is not enough to build a better world.
But it is great.
And it transcends politics.
Here is what I have learned, my epiphany.
Capitalism is not just about accumulation.
Its main asset is aspiration, which is what many people talk about on this stage, the aspiration that comes from dreams embedded in the free enterprise system.
We need to share it with more people.
I want to talk to you about a second epiphany that is related to the first and that can lead us to progress, not only in the world but also at home.
The best quote I've heard to summarize the thoughts I've just touched on for lifting people out of poverty is this: "Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history.
They have lifted billions of people out of poverty.
Who said that?
It sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
That's false.
President Barack Obama said that.
Why do I know it by heart?
Because he was speaking to me.
It's crazy.
And I said: "Hallelujah!"
But more than that, I said: "What an opportunity."
Do you know what I was thinking?
I was at an event organized on this topic at Georgetown University in May 2015.
And I thought it was the solution to the biggest problem facing America today. What is it?
It's about coming together around these ideas, liberal and conservative, to help those who need it most.
There's no need to tell you that we're in crisis, in America and in many countries around the world that are politically polarized.
It reached a critical level of crisis.
It's unpleasant. It's not fair.
Last year, there was an article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the West.
It was a 2014 article on the asymmetry of political motivations.
What is it? Psychologists refer to this as the phenomenon of assuming that your ideology is based on love, but your opponent's ideology is based on hate.
It's common in a global conflict.
You expect, for example, to see it between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the authors of this article found is that today in America, a majority of Republicans and Democrats suffer from an asymmetry of political motivations.
Today, a majority of politically active individuals believe they are motivated by love, but that the other party is motivated by hate.
Think about it. Think about it.
Most people say: "My ideology is based on fundamental goodwill, I want to help people, but the others are demonic and wish me harm."
Society cannot progress when there is this kind of asymmetry.
It's impossible.
How to solve this?
Firstly, let's be honest: there are differences.
Let's not minimize the differences. That would be naive.
There is a lot of research on this subject.
A veteran of the TED scene is my friend Jonathan Haidt.
He is a psychology professor at New York University.
He works on ideology, values, and morals of different individuals to see their differences.
He has, for example, shown us that conservatives and liberals have a different emphasis on what seems important to them.
For instance, Jon Haidt has shown that liberals care 59% more about poverty than about economic freedom.
And conservatives care 28% more about economic freedom than about poverty.
Irreconcilable differences?
We will never come together. False.
It is in our diversity that we find our strength.
Remember what lifted us out of poverty.
It was an obsession with poverty coupled with the spread of economic freedom across the globe.
We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people and lift the next two billion out of poverty.
There is no other solution.
How are we going to do it?
It's delicate.
We must innovate in the way we think.
Many issues are on the table.
Social entrepreneurship. Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal.
We need to invest abroad in a sustainable, responsible, ethical, and moral manner. Yes. Yes.
But what do we really need?
Of a flexible ideology,
less predictable.
Right?
Don't you ever get the feeling that your ideology is becoming predictable?
Almost conventional?
Don't you ever get the feeling of always listening to people who agree with you?
Why is this dangerous?
Because when we talk about economics in this country, on the right, conservatives, you're always talking about taxes, regulations, big government.
And on the left, liberals, you're always talking about income inequality.
These are important things, very important to me and to you.
But when it comes to helping people who are dying of hunger and need us, these are distractions.
We must come together around the best ways to alleviate poverty using the best tools at our disposal, which only happens when conservatives acknowledge their need for liberals and their preoccupation with poverty, and liberals recognize their need for conservatives and their fixation on the free market.
It is in this diversity that the future strength of this country resides, if we choose it.
How are we going to do it? How are we going to do it together?
I need an action plan, not just for you but for me.
Number one. First point: it is not enough to merely tolerate people who disagree.
It is not enough.
Let us remember that we need people who do not agree, because there are people who need all of us, who are still waiting for these tools.
What are you going to do? How are you going to express it?
Where does it start? It starts here.
In this room, we are all lucky.
Lucky to have people who listen to us.
Lucky to prosper. Lucky to lead.
When people hear us, with our unpredictable ideology, they might just listen.
The progress might just start there.
This is the first point. The second.
Secondly: I ask of you, and I ask of myself, to be specifically the person who blurs the line, who is ambiguous, hard to categorize.
If you are a conservative, be a conservative who always speaks of poverty and the moral duty to be a warrior for the poor.
If you are a liberal, be a liberal who always speaks of the beauty of free markets, used responsibly, to solve our problems.
If we do this, we get two things.
One: we start working for the next billions and become the solution we have seen in the past and that we need in the future. We achieve this.
And the second thing is that we might be able to take the awful ideological holy war that we suffer from in this country and transform it into an ideas competition based on solidarity and mutual respect.
And perhaps, perhaps, we will realize that our great differences are not ultimately so great after all.
Thank you.
