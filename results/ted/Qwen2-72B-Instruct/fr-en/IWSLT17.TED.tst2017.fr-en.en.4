We were there, souls and bodies crammed into a church in Texas, on the last night of our lives.
Crammed into a room just like this one, but with old wooden benches draped in worn red fabric, an organ to my left and a choir behind me, the baptismal font embedded in the wall behind this one.
A room just like this one, nevertheless.
With that same wonderful sense of suspense, the same deep hopes for salvation, the same sweat in the palms, and the same people at the back who aren't listening.
It was December 31, 1999, the night of Christ's second coming, and the end of the world as I knew it.
I had turned twelve that year, and I had reached the age of accountability.
After I stopped complaining about the injustice of Jesus' return just when I was supposed to be held accountable for my actions, I realized it was better that I clean up quickly.
I went to church as often as possible.
I watched the silence with the anxiety of someone who would watch for noise, trying to assure myself that the Lord hadn't played a trick on me and decided to come back earlier.
And in case He came back earlier, I had prepared a contingency plan, by reading the "Left Behind" series which were a hit at the time.
I found in their pages that if I wasn't taken at midnight, I had another chance.
I just needed to avoid taking the mark of the beast, to fight the demons, the plagues, and the Antichrist himself.
It would be difficult — but I knew I was capable.
But it was no longer time to get organized.
It was 11:50 p.m.
We had 10 minutes left, and my pastor called us to the altar, for he wanted to pray when midnight struck.
Each faction of the congregation took its place.
The choir remained in the choir stall, the deacons and their wives—or the Baptist Bourgeoisie, as I like to call them—took their places in the front row facing the altar.
You see, in the United States, even the Second Coming of Christ has a VIP section.
And just behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie were the elderly—those men and women whose backs had once bent under the hot sun of the East Texas cotton fields, whose skins seemed marked with a smooth and dignified brown, much like the clay of East Texas, whose hopes and dreams for what would become of their lives outside of East Texas had sometimes been shattered,
deeper than their backs.
Yes, these men and women were the stars of the show for me.
They had waited for this moment all their lives, just as their medieval forebears had eagerly awaited the end of the world, and as my grandmother waited for The Oprah Winfrey Show on Channel 8 every day at 4 p.m.
And as she made her way to the altar, I hid behind her, for I was absolutely certain that my grandmother would go to Heaven.
And I thought that if I held her hand tightly during the prayer, it was possible that I might go with her.
So I held her hand, and I closed my eyes, to listen, to wait.
The prayers grew louder.
And the cries in response to the call to prayer rose even higher.
The organ joined in the somber atmosphere.
And the rising heat added to the sweat.
My hand tightened its grip, so as not to be the one left behind.
I squeezed my eyes shut tighter, so as not to see the separation of the wheat from the chaff.
Then a voice rose above us: "Amen."
It was over.
I looked at the clock.
It was past midnight.
I looked at the older believers, for whom the Savior had not come, too proud to show their disappointment, who had believed too much and for too long to start doubting now.
But I was upset for them.
They had been duped, deceived, hoodwinked, and I had let myself be carried away with them.
I had said their prayers, I had not given in to temptation as best I could.
I hadn't dipped my head once, but twice, in those baptismal fonts that gave you a cold.
I had believed.
And now what?
I made it home in time to turn on the TV and watch Peter Jennings announce the new millennium, as he moved around the world.
I was struck by the strangeness of the multiple returns of Jesus, based on the different time zones.
And I felt even more ridiculous - hurt, really.
But that night, I didn't stop believing.
I just started to believe something new: that it was possible not to believe.
It was possible that the answers were wrong, that the questions themselves were wrong.
Where once there had been a mountain of certainty, now there was at its base a spring of doubt, a spring that promised rivers.
I can trace the entire tragedy of my life back to that night in the church, when my Savior did not come for me; when what I truly believed in proved to be, if not a lie, then at least, not entirely the truth.
Although some may have prepared for the year 2000 in a very different way, I am convinced that you are here because a part of you has done the same thing as I have since the beginning of this new century, since my mother left, since my father did not return and since my Lord refused to come.
And I reached out my hand, to grasp something to believe in.
I held on, when I arrived at Yale at 18 years old, confident that my journey from Oak Cliff, in Texas, was a chance to leave behind all the trials I had endured, the shattered dreams and broken bodies I had witnessed.
But when I found myself at home during winter break, face to the floor, hands tied behind my back, and a burglar's gun to my head, I knew that even the best education could not save me.
I held on when I arrived at Lehman Brothers as an intern in 2008.
So full of hope - that I called my family to tell them that we would never be poor again.
But when I saw this temple of finance crumbling before my eyes, I knew that even the best job could not save me.
I held on when I arrived in Washington, as a young employee who had heard a voice coming from Illinois, saying: "We have waited for a long time, but with this election, change has come to the United States."
But when Congress stalled, the country tore itself apart, and hope and change rang hollow like a joke, I knew that even a political second coming could not save me.
I had faithfully knelt at the altar of the American Dream, praying to the gods of my era, gods of success, money, and power.
But again and again, midnight struck, and I opened my eyes to witness the death of all these gods.
From that graveyard, I began to search once more, not out of bravery, but because I knew that either I believed, or I died.
So I embarked on a pilgrimage, once again to another Mecca, Harvard Business School - this time knowing that I could not simply accept the salvation it purported to offer.
No, I knew there would be more work to do.
The work began late, in a dark corner of a crowded party, on a miserable early winter night in Cambridge, when three friends and I asked ourselves a question that young people in search of authenticity have pondered for a long time: "What if we hit the road?"
We didn't know where to go or how to get there, but we knew we had to do it.
All our lives, we yearned, as Jack Kerouac wrote, to "slip out into the night and disappear somewhere," and go see what everyone was doing all over the country.
Although other voices argued that the risk was too great and the evidence too slight, we set out nonetheless.
We traveled nearly 8,000 miles across America during the summer of 2013, through the pastures of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit, the swamps of New Orleans, where we met and worked with men and women who were creating small businesses whose very purpose defined their goals.
Having been trained at the far western end of capitalism, this appeared to us as a revolutionary idea.
And this idea spread, growing into a nonprofit organization, MBAs Across America, a movement that brought me here, to this stage, today.
This idea grew because we found that our generation is hungry for purpose, for meaning,
because we found countless entrepreneurs in every corner of America, who were creating jobs, changing lives, and who needed a little help.
But if I'm honest, it also grew because I fought for it.
I spared no effort to preach this gospel, to get more people to believe that we could heal the wounds of a broken country, one social enterprise at a time.
But it was this gospel journey that led me to this rather different gospel that I have come to share with you today.
This journey began one evening, almost a year ago, at the Natural History Museum in New York, during a gala for Harvard Business School alumni.
Beneath a full-size replica of a whale, I sat among the titans of our age, as they celebrated their peers and their good deeds.
There was pride in a room where the value and net assets under management exceeded $500 billion.
We reviewed everything we had done, and it was good.
But fate had it that two days later, I had to go not far from there, to Harlem. I found myself sitting in an urban farm that had once been a vacant lot, listening to a man named Tony talk about the kids who came here every day.
They all lived below the poverty line.
Many of them carried their belongings in a backpack to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter.
Some of them participated in Tony's program, called Harlem Grown, to receive their only meal of the day.
Tony told me he had started Harlem Grown with his retirement money, after 20 years as a taxi driver.
He told me he wasn't paying himself, because despite its success, the program was struggling to secure resources.
He told me he would accept any help he could get.
And I was there to help.
When I left Tony, I felt the burn and salt of tears welling up in my eyes.
I felt the weight of the realization that I could sit in a room one evening where a few hundred people had $500 billion dollars, and in another room, just two days later, barely five kilometers away, where a man lived without pay so that a child could have his only meal of the day.
It wasn't the glaring inequality that made me want to cry. It wasn't the thought of those hungry, homeless children, it wasn't anger at the 1% or pity for the 99%.
No, I was disturbed because I had finally realized that I was the dialysis of a country in need of a kidney transplant.
I realized that my story was replacing all those of people who were expected to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, even if they had nothing to grab onto to do so; that my body was substituting for all the structural, systemic support that never reached Harlem, or the Appalachians, or Level -9; that my voice was replacing all those voices that seemed too ignorant, too proletarian, too maladjusted.
And this shame, this shame washed over me, like the shame of sitting in front of the television watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium, again, and again, and again.
I had been duped, deceived, hoodwinked.
But this time, the false Savior was me.
You see, I've come a long way from the altar, that night when I thought the world was going to end, from a world where people spoke in tongues, viewed suffering as a necessary act of God, and took a text as an infallible truth.
Yes, I've come so far that I find myself right back where I started.
Because it's simply untrue to say that we live in an age of disbelief - no, we believe just as much today as we did before.
Some of us might believe in the prophecy of Brené Brown or Tony Robbins.
We can believe in the gospel of The New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review.
We can believe deeply when we worship here, at the TED Church, but we want desperately to believe, we need to believe.
We speak the language of charismatic leaders who promise to solve all our problems.
We view suffering as a necessary act of capitalism, our god. We take the text of technological progress as an infallible truth.
And we hardly realize the human cost we pay, when we fail to question a single brick, for fear it might dismantle all our foundations.
But if you are disturbed by the unacceptable things we have come to accept, then it must be time for a radical reassessment.
I have no gospel of disruption or innovation, or a triple bottom line.
In fact, I have no gospel of faith to share with you today.
I have, and I offer, a gospel of doubt.
The gospel of doubt does not ask that you cease to believe, but that you believe in something new: that it is possible not to believe.
It is possible that the answers are false, that the questions themselves are false.
Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible we, on this stage, in this room, may be wrong.
Because it raises the question: "Why?"
With all the power we hold in our hands, why do people still suffer so much?
This doubt leads me to share that we are placing my organization, MBAs Across America, into receivership.
We have dismissed our team and closed our doors, and we will freely share our model with anyone who grasps the power to do this work without waiting for our permission.
This doubt compels me to relinquish the savior role some expect of me, because there isn't enough time and our odds are too slim to await second comings, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here.
And this doubt, it regenerates me, it gives me hope, that when our problems overwhelm us, when the paths designed for us seem to lead us to our doom, when our healers provide no relief for our wounds, it will not be our blind faith - no, it will be our humble doubt that will illuminate just a little bit the darkness of our lives and our world, and allow us to raise our voices to whisper,
to shout, or simply, very simply: "There must be another way."
Thank you.
