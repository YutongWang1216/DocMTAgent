At university, I specialized in Political Science, so I had to write a lot of essays.
When a regular student writes an essay, they spread out the work a bit like this.
You know... You might start slowly, but you write a little during the first week and combined with more productive days, eventually, everything is done and everyone keeps calm.
And I would like to do it this way.
That would be the goal. Everything would be prepared. But the dissertation comes and then, I do this.
And it's like this for every dissertation.
Then came my 90-page senior thesis, a document on which you're supposed to work for a year.
I knew that for such a dissertation, my usual pace wasn't sustainable.
So I planned everything, and I decided that I had to get to something like this.
The year was going to unfold like this.
So I was going to start light, and I was going to increase in the middle months, and at the end, I was going to shift into high gear, like a little staircase.
Climbing stairs, where is the difficulty?
It's not much, is it?
But then, something funny happened.
These first months?
They came and went and I really couldn't work.
So we have a great revised plan.
And then... But then, these middle months arrived and I didn't really write a word, so we were here.
Then, two months turn into one month, which turns into two weeks.
And one day, I wake up with three days before the deadline, still not having written a word. So I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours, with not one, but two sleepless nights. Humans aren't made to pull two all-nighters. I ran across the campus, dived in slow motion, and submitted the essay just before the deadline.
I thought it was the end of all that.
But a week later, I received a phone call from the university.
And they say: "Tim Urban?"
And I answered: "Yes."
"We need to talk about your thesis."
"OK."
And they say: "It's the best we've ever seen."
This is not true.
It was a very, very bad thesis.
I just wanted to savor this one moment when you all thought: "This guy is fantastic!"
No, it was very, very bad.
Today, I write a blog.
I write the blog Wait But Why.
A few years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.
My behavior has always baffled the non-procrastinators around me. I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in our heads, why we are the way we are.
I had a theory that the brain of a procrastinator is actually different from the brain of other people.
To test this, I found an MRI lab that allowed me to scan my brain and that of a confirmed non-procrastinator, so I could compare them.
I brought them here to show them to you today.
I want you to look closely to identify a difference.
I know that if you're not brain experts, it's not that obvious, but try.
So here is the brain of a non-procrastinator.
Now...
here is my brain.
There is a difference.
Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.
What does this mean for the procrastinator?
This means that everything is fine until this happens.
So the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision to do something productive. But the Monkey doesn't like this plan, so he takes the wheel and says: "Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page on the Nancy Kerrigan/Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that."
So... So we head to the fridge to see if there's anything new since the last ten minutes.
After that, we spiral into a YouTube session that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much, much later with interviews of Justin Bieber's mom.
"Since all of this is going to take time, we won't have time to work today. Sorry!"
What is happening here?
The Monkey doesn't seem like someone you want at the wheel.
He lives entirely in the present moment.
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he is interested in only two things: ease and fun.
In the animal world, this works just fine.
If you're a dog and you spend your life doing nothing but easy and fun things, you're fantastic!
For the Monkey, humans are just another animal species.
You have to sleep, eat, and create a new generation. This could work in the Stone Age.
But if you haven't noticed, we don't live in the Stone Age.
We live in an advanced civilization and the Monkey doesn't know what that is.
That's why we have another person in our brain, the Rational Decision-Maker, who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do.
We can project ourselves into the future.
We can have an overview of the situation.
We can make long-term plans.
And he wants to take all of this into account.
And he wants us to just do what is logical, here and now.
Sometimes it makes sense to do easy and fun things, like when you're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying some well-deserved free time.
There is an overlap. Sometimes they agree.
But at other times, it makes much more sense to do harder and less enjoyable things, for the greater good of the overall situation.
A conflict then arises.
For the procrastinator, this conflict tends to resolve the same way each time, leaving them spending a lot of time in the orange zone, an easy and fun place, completely outside the Circle of Logic.
I call it the Dark Playground.
The Dark Playground is a place that you all procrastinators know very well.
It's where leisure activities happen at times when they shouldn't be taking place.
The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun, because it's unearned, and the air is filled with guilt, fear, anxiety, self-loathingâ€”all those good procrastinator feelings.
In this situation, with the Monkey at the wheel, the question is: how can the procrastinator get here into the blue zone, a less enjoyable place, but where the really important things get done?
It turns out that the procrastinator has a guardian angel. Someone who watches over him during his worst moments. Someone called the Panic Monster.
The Panic Monster sleeps most of the time but wakes up suddenly every time a deadline gets too close or there's a risk of public embarrassment, a career disaster, or any other terrible consequence.
And most importantly, it's the only thing the Monkey is afraid of.
It has become very relevant in my life very recently, when the people from TED contacted me six months ago and invited me to give a talk.
Of course, I said yes.
It has always been my dream to have given a talk for TED.
But in the midst of this excitement, the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind.
He was saying, "Do you realize what you've agreed to?"
"Do you understand what is about to happen now?"
We need to sit down and work on this right now.
And the Monkey said, "Absolutely, but let's open Google Earth and look at southern India, like 50 meters above ground level, and scroll through the map for two and a half hours until we reach the northern part of the country, to better understand India."
That's what we did that day.
As six months turned into four, then two, and one month, the folks at TED decided to publish the list of speakers.
I opened the website and saw my face staring back at me.
And guess who woke up?
The Panic Monster starts to lose its mind, and a few seconds later, it's total anarchy in the entire system.
And the Monkey, remember, is terrified of the Panic Monster Boom, there he goes up the tree!
And finally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the presentation.
The Panic Monster explains much of the procrastinator's rather irrational behavior, such as how someone like me can spend two weeks unable to begin a single sentence of an essay and then miraculously find the incredible work ethic to stay up all night to write eight pages.
All this situation, with these three characters, is the procrastinator's system. 
It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.
This is what I decided to write about on the blog a few years ago.
When I did, I was surprised by the responses.
Thousands of emails arrived, from all around the world, from all kinds of people, doing all sorts of things.
There were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and many, many graduate students.
They were all writing to say the same thing: "I have this problem too."
But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the article and the heavy tone of these emails.
These people wrote with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives, about what the Monkey had done to them.
I thought about it and said: if the procrastinator's system works, where's the problem?
Why do these people feel so bad?
Apparently, there are two types of procrastinations.
All the examples I've given today have a deadline.
If there is a deadline, the effects of procrastination are contained in the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved.
But there is a second type that occurs in situations without a deadline.
If you want a career as an independent, something in the arts or entrepreneurship, at the beginning, there is no deadline for these things because nothing is happening until you start doing the hard work to gain momentum so that things start moving. Lots of important things
outside of your career have no deadline, such as your family, your health, exercising, working on your romantic relationship or getting out of it when it's not working.
If the procrastinator's only mechanism for tackling tough tasks is the Panic Monster, it's a problem because in all these situations without deadlines, he's not around, he has no reason to wake up. The effects of procrastination are unchecked and spread infinitely.
It's this type of long-term procrastination that is much less visible and talked about far less than the more amusing, short-term kind based on deadlines.
We often suffer from it silently and in private.
It can be a source of a huge amount of pain and regret.
This was why these people were sending me these emails and why they felt so bad.
It's not that they were cramming on certain projects.
Long-term procrastination has sometimes turned them into mere spectators of their own lives.
The frustration is not that they can't achieve their dreams, it's that they can't even take the first step.
So I read these emails and had a sort of epiphany: I don't think non-procrastinators exist.
That's true. I think you're all procrastinators.
Maybe not all of you are in as bad shape as some of us...  ...and some of you here may have a healthy relationship with deadlines. But remember: the Monkey's biggest trap comes when deadlines don't exist.
I want to show you one last thing.
I call it the Calendar of Life.
A box for each week for a 90-year life.
It doesn't amount to that many boxes, especially when you've already used up quite a few.
I think we should all take a close look at this calendar.
We need to think about the things we procrastinate on because everyone procrastinates on something in their life.
We must remain aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey.
It's work for each and every one of us.
There aren't that many boxes left, so it's work that should probably start today.
In fact, maybe not today...
You know...
Soon.
Thank you.
