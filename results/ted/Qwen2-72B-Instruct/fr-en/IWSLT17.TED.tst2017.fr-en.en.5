The food crisis
is in the news every day.
But what is it?
In some parts of the world, there is too little food, or perhaps too much.
Elsewhere, GMOs are saving the world.
Maybe GMOs are the problem?
Too many agricultural runoffs create toxic oceans, the decline of food.
And so on.
I find the current climate of this discussion incredibly discouraging.
How can we bring this topic back to something we understand?
What does this apple tell us about the food crisis?
I'm sure you all ate an apple last week.
How old do you think she was when she was picked?
Two weeks?
Two months?
Eleven months. That's the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the U.S.
And I don't think it's very different in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
We pick them, we put them in refrigerated warehouses, we gas the warehouses. There are actually documented evidence of workers trying to go into these environments to retrieve an apple, and dying because the atmosphere to slow down the ripening of the apple is toxic to humans.
How is it that none of you knew this?
Why didn't I know this?
90% of the quality of this apple, all the antioxidants, are gone by the time it gets to us.
In fact, it's just a little ball of sugar.
How do we have so little information and how can we do better?
I think what's missing is a platform.
I know platforms. I know computers. I was stuck in front of the internet when I was young.
I've done very strange things... ...on this platform.
But I met people, and I could express myself.
How can one express oneself in food?
If we had a platform, we might feel able to ask: What if?
I wondered: What if... the climate was democratic?
So, here is a map of the climate around the world.
The most productive areas in green, the least productive in red.
They change, they replace each other, and now California farmers are Mexican.
China is taking land in Brazil to grow better food, and we are slaves to the climate.
What if every country had its own productive climate?
What would that change about the way we live?
What would that change for the quality of life and food?
The problem of the previous generation was to have more food and to have it cheaper.
Welcome to your global farm.
We have built a vast analog farm.
All these lines are cars, planes, trains, and transportation.
It's a miracle that we feed seven billion people with only a few of us involved in food production.
And what if...
what if we built a digital farm?
A global digital farm.
And what if you could take this apple, digitize it in a way, send it as particles through the air and reconstruct it on the other side?
What would happen?
Let's revisit some quotes. They inspire me in what I do.
The first: "Japanese agriculture has no childhood, no water, no land, and no future." That's what I discovered when I went to Minamisanriku, south of Fukushima, after the disaster.
The children have left for Sendai and Tokyo, the land is contaminated, and they already import 70% of their own food.
But this is not just about Japan.
2% of the American population is involved in agriculture.
What good can come from only 2% of the population?
Traveling around the world, 50% of the African population is under 18 years old.
80% of them do not want to become farmers.
Agriculture is difficult.
The life of a small agricultural entrepreneur is miserable.
They are leaving for the city.
In India, farmers do not have access to basic services. There are more farmer suicides this year than in the past ten years combined.
It's uncomfortable to talk about it.
Where are they going?
To the city.
There are no more young people, and everyone is leaving.
So, how can we build a platform that would inspire young people?
Welcome to the new tractor.
This is my combine harvester.
A few years ago now, I went to Bed Bath & Beyond, and Home Depot and I started to hack.
I've built stupid things, I've made plants dance, I connected them to my computer, and I killed them all; I've killed a lot.
I finally managed to keep them alive.
And I created one of the most intimate relationships of my entire existence, because I was learning the language of plants.
I wanted to do something bigger.
They told me, "Do what you enjoy, young man!
Here is an old electronics lab that nobody wants.
What can you do?
With my team, we have built a farm inside the Media Lab, a renowned place, not for biology, but rather for computer science.
Within these 6 square meters, we produced enough food to feed about 300 people once a month. That's not much food.
There are lots of interesting technologies in there.
But the most interesting thing?
Beautiful white roots, deep green colors, and a monthly harvest.
Is it a new cafeteria?
Is it a new retail experience?
Is it a new grocery store?
I can assure you one thing: it's the first time someone in the Media Lab has pulled out the roots of anything.
We have bagged salads, there's nothing wrong with that.
But what happens when you have an image processing expert, a data specialist, a roboticist, who pull out roots and think, "I know a thing or two about this. I can do it, I want to give it a try."
In this context, we would grow the plants and bring some back to the lab, because when you grow them, you don't discard them, you become attached to them.
I now have strange taste buds; I'm afraid to let anyone eat something without tasting it myself, because I want it to be good.
I eat lettuce every day and I can give you its pH accurate to one-tenth.
And I say: "No, its pH is 6.1, you can't eat it today."
That lettuce that day was super soft.
It was super soft because the plant was stressed and it had triggered a chemical reaction within itself as a defense mechanism: "I'm not going to die!"
And the plants that don't want to die, seem sweet to me.
The techies are floored by plant physiology.
We thought that other people should be able to try it out as well.
We wanted to see what people can create, so we designed a lab that can be shipped anywhere.
Then we built it.
On the premises of the Media Lab, there is my laboratory, which has about 30 detection points per plant.
If you know the genome or the genetics, this is the phenotype, okay?
The phenomena.
When you say, "I love Mexican strawberries," you really love the strawberries from the climate that produced the expression that pleases you.
So, if you code the climate - this amount of CO2 and this amount of oxygen create a recipe - you code the expression of this plant, the nutrition of this plant, the size of this plant, the shape, the color, the texture.
We need data, so we've installed a bunch of sensors to tell us what's going on.
Think about your houseplants! You're super sad because you wonder, "Why are you dying? Why won't you talk to me?"
Farmers acquire a unique capability when they pass the age of 60 or 70 years.
They can tell when a plant is dying whether it's due to a nitrogen deficiency, a calcium deficiency, or if it just needs more water.
This unique ability does not get passed on.
Here are the portents of the "farmer in the cloud."
We track these data over time.
We correlate them with specific plants.
These are all the broccoli in my laboratory, by IP address.
Our broccoli can be reached by IP address.
And if that isn't weird enough, you click once and get a plant's profile.
And it gives you the downloadable growth history of this plant, but not as you might think, not just when it's ready.
When does it reach the nutrition I need?
When does it reach the desired taste?
Is it getting too much water?
Is it getting too much sun?
Alerts.
She can speak to me, she engages in dialogue, we have a language.
I think she is the first user of the plants' Facebook!
This is her plant profile and this plant is going to start making friends.
I believe this: she will become buddies with other plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, less potassium.
We will learn more about a complexity that we could only guess at.
Maybe they won't become our friends, maybe they will, it will be up to us.
This is my laboratory.
It's a bit more organized, my job is to design data centers for hospitals, so I know a thing or two about creating controlled environments.
And so, within this environment, we experiment with all sorts of things.
This process, aeroponic, was developed by NASA for the Mir space station to reduce the amount of water sent into space.
This process gives the plant exactly what it wants: water, minerals, and oxygen.
The roots aren't that complicated. When you give them this, you get an amazing result.
It's as if the plant had two hearts.
And because it has two hearts, it grows four or five times faster.
It's a perfect world.
We have progressed in tech and seeds for a hostile world and we will continue to do so, but we also have a new tool, which is a perfect world.
We have grown all sorts of things.
These tomatoes hadn't been produced and sold in 150 years.
Did you know that we have banks for rare and ancient seeds?
Seed banks.
It's amazing.
They have genetic material, things you've never eaten.
I am the only person in this room who has eaten this kind of tomato.
This is a sauce tomato that we don't know how to cook. We ate this tomato. And it wasn't great.
We've done things with proteins, all sorts of things.
We have grown humans. Maybe you would do it, but we didn't.
What we realized is... that the tool was too big, and too expensive.
I started distributing it around the world and it cost about $100,000.
Finding someone with $100,000 in their pocket isn't easy, so we looked to make it smaller.
This was the project of one of my undergraduate mechanical engineering students, Camille.
Camille and I, along with the entire team, spent the whole summer trying to figure out how to make it cheaper, how to make it work better, and how others could do it too.
We placed them in schools, from sixth grade to senior year.
And if you want to stay humble, try teaching children.
I went to the school and said, "Set the humidity to 65%."
A middle school student asked me: "What is humidity?"
I replied: "Water in the air."
He said: "There isn't water in the air, you're an idiot."
And I replied: "Very well...
Don't trust me.
Set it to 100.
He sets it to 100 and what happens?
It starts to condense, creating mist and, eventually, droplets.
And he says: "Oh. Humidity is rain."
"Why didn't you tell me?"
We created an interface like that of a game.
They have a 3D environment, they can connect anywhere in the world from their smartphone or tablet.
They have the various parts of the bots, the sensors.
They choose recipes created by other children all around the world.
They select and activate this recipe, they plant a seedling.
While it grows, they make adjustments.
"Why does a plant need CO2?"
Is CO2 bad? It kills people!
Increase the CO2, the plant dies.
Reduce the CO2, the plant is doing just fine.
Harvest the plant, you have just created a new digital recipe.
It's a design, an iterative development, and an exploration process.
They can download all the data on this new plant they have developed or the new digital recipe and what it did - was it better or worse?
Imagine this as the little hearts of the process.
We are going to learn so much.
Here is one of the ordi-nutritionals, as we call them, in a school after three weeks.
That's three weeks of growth.
But even more importantly, it was the first time this kid thought he could be a farmer - or that he might want to be a farmer.
We have put everything on open source.
Everything is online; try building your first ordi-nutritional.
It's going to be tough - I'm telling you.
We are at the beginning, but everything is there.
It is very important to me that it be easily accessible.
We are going to continue to move in this direction.
They are farmers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, plant scientists, economists, urban planners,
on a single platform, doing what they're good at.
But we might have aimed a bit too high.
This is my new setup that we just launched.
This warehouse could be anywhere.
That's why I chose it.
And inside this warehouse, we are going to build something a bit like this.
These already exist.
Look.
These also exist.
One allows us to grow greenery, the other enables the production of the Ebola vaccine.
It's cool that this factory, the big winner of the DARPA challenge, is one of the reasons for the progress on Ebola.
The factories produce the protein that resists the Ebola virus.
From pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, to plain lettuce.
But these two things couldn't be more different, and that's where I'm in my element.
Everything is different.
We're at this weird stage of: "We're almost there." It's kind of like: "Here's my black box. -- No, buy mine.
-- No, no - I have the intellectual property, fully valid.
"Don't buy his, buy mine."
In fact, we are just at the beginning, at a time when society is also changing.
As we demand more food but at cheaper prices, we also demand better nutrition that respects the environment.
When you have a McDonald's ad explaining what's in the McNuggets, - the most mysterious food product of all time - upon which their marketing campaign is based, everything is changing.
From now on,
Personal food computers, food servers, and food data centers, operate on the open phenomenon.
Think of an open genome, but we will add little climate recipes, akin to Wikipedia, that you can retrieve, update, and grow.
What does this look like in reality?
Do you remember the planet connected by lines?
We are starting to get the markers.
We are starting to send information about food, rather than sending the food itself.
This is not only my dream, these are the places where we are already deploying.
Food computers, food servers, soon food data centers, connecting people to share information.
The future of food is not about fighting what's wrong.
We know what's wrong.
The future of food lies in networking the next billion farmers and empowering them with a platform to ask and answer the question, "What if?"
I thank you.
