Hello.
My name is Matthew Williams, and I am a champion.
I have won medals in three different sports and national championships in Canada, played at an international level in basketball, and I was proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I train 5 days a week in basketball and speed skating, work with high-quality coaches and mental performance consultants to be the best in my sport.
Furthermore, I do all this with the Special Olympics.
Does this change the way you perceive me and my achievements?
The world does not see people like me as champions.
Not so long ago, people like me were shunned and hidden.
The Special Olympics have come a long way since their inception in 1968, but all too often, individuals with intellectual disabilities remain invisible to the general public.
People use the "R" word with me, and they think it's not a big deal.
It's the word "retarded" or "backward" used in a derogatory manner.
They don't realize how much it hurts us, me and my friends.
I don't want you to think that I'm here for a charity case.
I am here because there is still a major issue with how many people perceive individuals with intellectual disabilities, or, all too often, the way they do not see them at all.
Did you know that the world championships took place this year?
I was among the more than 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries competing in Los Angeles.
There were over 62,000 spectators at the opening ceremonies, and there was TSN and ESPN to cover the event.
Did you know that this event had taken place?
What do you think when you meet someone like me?
I am here today to challenge you to consider us as equals.
The Special Olympics transform the identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perception of anyone watching the competition.
For those of you who may not know, the Special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
The Special Olympics are separate from the Paralympic and Olympic Games.
We offer high-quality year-round sports programs for individuals with intellectual disabilities, which changes lives and perceptions.
This movement has changed my life and that of so many others.
And it has changed the way the world sees individuals with intellectual disabilities.
I was born epileptic and with an intellectual disability.
Growing up, I played hockey until I was 12 years old.
The more I grew, the more I felt it was harder to keep up with others, and I was getting annoyed and frustrated.
For a while, I didn't play any sports, had no friends, and felt forgotten and sad.
There was a time when individuals with intellectual disabilities were hidden from society.
No one thought they could play a sport, let alone be a valuable member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, studied the effects of regular exercise on the physical condition of children with intellectual disabilities.
Using rigorous scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers concluded that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that led to issues of physical condition.
Many people doubted that individuals with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sports competitions.
But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of the Special Olympics, persisted, and the Special Olympics athletes have proven them right four and a half million times over.
Before I joined the Special Olympics, I was nervous because I was young, shy, and lacked self-confidence and I didn't have many friends.
When I arrived, however, everyone encouraged me a lot, supported me, and let me be myself without being judged.
Now, I am a basketball player and a speed skater who has competed in regional and national games, and this year, I ended up at the Summer World Games in Los Angeles, where I was part of the very first Canadian basketball team to participate in the World Games.
I am one of the more than four and a half million athletes worldwide, and I have heard so many similar stories.
Being a Special Olympics athlete restores pride and dignity.
The Special Olympics also address significant health needs.
Studies have shown that on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than those without, and women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years younger than those without.
The Special Olympics keep us healthy by keeping us active and involved in a sport.
Furthermore, our coaches teach us about nutrition and health.
The Special Olympics also provide free health screenings for athletes who struggle to communicate with their doctor or access medical care.
At the 2015 Summer World Games, my teammates from Team Canada and I were playing against the Nigerian team.
The day before our game, the Nigerian basketball team came for the athlete health screenings; hearing devices were freely distributed to seven out of ten members, giving them the opportunity to hear clearly for the first time.
This change for them was incredible.
They were very excited, happy, and confident because their coaches could now communicate verbally with them.
And they were deeply moved because they could hear the sounds of the basketball, the sounds of the whistle, and the enthusiastic fans in the stands - sounds that we take for granted.
The Special Olympics do more than transform athletes in sports.
The Special Olympics transform their lives beyond the playing fields.
This year, a study showed that nearly half of adults in the United States do not know a single person with an intellectual disability, and the 44% of Americans who have no personal contact with intellectual disabilities are significantly less tolerant and positive.
Then there is the "R" word, demonstrating that individuals with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people.
People use it as a common term or an insult.
It was tweeted over nine million times last year, and it is deeply hurtful to me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the world.
People don't realize how insulting it is, but it truly is.
As my fellow athlete and Global Messenger John Franklin Stephens wrote in an open letter to a political commentator who had used the R-word as an insult, "Come join us one day at the Special Olympics.
You'll see if you leave with an unchanged heart."
This year, at the 2015 Summer World Games, people lined up for hours before diving into the final night of weightlifting competition.
That evening saw a packed house when my teammate Jackie Barrett, the Newfoundland Lancer, lifted 297 kg and 277 kg in squats—setting huge new records at the Special Olympics.
Jackie is one of the record holders among all weightlifters in Newfoundland—not just at the Special Olympics but among all weightlifters.
Jackie was a huge celebrity in Los Angeles, and ESPN live-tweeted his new record, being impressed by his performance.
Fifty years ago, few people imagined that individuals with intellectual disabilities were capable of doing something like this.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the iconic LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of the World Games and cheer on athletes from 165 countries coming from around the world.
Far from being hidden, we were cheered and celebrated.
The Special Olympics teach athletes to be confident and proud of themselves.
The Special Olympics teach the world that individuals with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and consideration.
Now, I have dreams and achievements in my sport, amazing coaches, respect and dignity, better health, and I am pursuing a career as a personal trainer.
I am no longer hidden, ridiculed, and I am here giving a TED talk.
The world is a different place thanks to the Special Olympics, but there is still work to be done.
So the next time you see someone with intellectual disabilities, I hope you see their talent.
The next time someone uses the R-word around you, I hope you'll tell them just how hurtful it is.
I hope you will consider getting involved with the Special Olympics.
I would like to leave you with one final thought.
Nelson Mandela said, "Sport has the power to change the world."
The Special Olympics change the world by transforming four and a half million athletes and by giving us a place where we can have confidence, meet friends, not be judged, and feel and be champions.
Thank you very much.
