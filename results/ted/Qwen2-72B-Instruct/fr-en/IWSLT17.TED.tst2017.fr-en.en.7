When I was little, I dreamed of the ocean.
A wild, very colorful place full of life, sheltering strange and fantastic creatures.
I imagined large sharks reigning supreme and graceful sea turtles darting through the corals.
First a marine biologist, then a photographer, I spent most of my career searching for places as magical as those I dreamed of when I was little.
As you can see, I started exploring the water very early on.
But the first time I really went underwater, I was about 10 years old.
I remember distinctly giving determined kicks to reach that old cannon embedded in a shallow coral reef.
When I finally managed to grab it, I looked up and found myself surrounded by fish of every color of the rainbow.
That day, I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Peschak Marine Conservation Photographer In 40 years spent on Earth, I have had the immense privilege of exploring some of the wildest marine landscapes for National Geographic and for the Save Our Seas foundation.
I've photographed it all, from huge sharks to tiny ones that fit in the palm of your hand.
I felt the fish in the breath of the humpback whales feeding next to me in the cold waters of Canada, near the Great Bear Rainforest.
I even learned all about the courtship rituals of the green turtle in the Mozambique Channel.
We all leave a mark on the ocean, and vice versa.
And the pristine seas I dreamed of as a child are becoming ever harder to find.
They are becoming ever smaller and more threatened.
While we humans maintain our role as the planet's top predator, I have witnessed direct repercussions and photographed them.
I long believed I had to shock my audience with disturbing images to rouse them from their indifference.
This approach has its merits, but I have reconsidered it.
In my view, the best way to effect change is to sell love.
If you will, I'm a matchmaker, and as a photographer, I have the extraordinary opportunity to reveal animals and entire ecosystems hidden beneath the ocean's surface.
One cannot love and fight for something if one is unaware of its existence.
Revealing this - it's the entire power of marine photography.
Among the hundreds of underwater places I've seen, a handful of these landscapes have deeply moved me.
I saw the first of these landscapes about 10 years ago, off the wild and rugged coast of South Africa.
Every summer, massive schools of sardines move northward, a mass migration phenomenon known as the Sardine Run.
A frenzied race of these fish
where hordes of hungry and agile predators chase them.
Common dolphins hunt together, managing to isolate sardines from the main school and creating smaller schools.
They dive and trap the fish upwards, against the surface, and rush to enjoy their wriggling feast.
The sharks follow closely.
For many people, sharks and dolphins are sworn enemies, but during the Sardine Run, they coexist.
In fact, the dolphins help the sharks feed more efficiently.
Without the dolphins, the schools created are more scattered, and the sharks often end up with a "sardine doughnut" or a mouthful of water.
I've had some lively moments with sharks during the Sardine Run, but I know they don't see me as prey.
I take my hits and am jostled like all the other participants in this scrappy feast.
Let's leave the African shores, heading east across the vastness of the Indian Ocean to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands.
During monsoon season, manta rays from across the entire archipelago head toward a tiny islet in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.
Armies of crustaceans, most smaller than a marble, form the staple diet of manta rays.
When plankton concentrations are low, manta rays feed alone, performing back loops repeatedly, much like a puppy chasing its tail.
When the plankton density increases, the rays line up in single file and form these long chains. Every tasty morsel that escapes the first ray is gobbled up by the second or the one after.
When the plankton concentration reaches its peak, the manta rays swim ever closer in a rotational movement through which they feed.
As they whirl in this tight formation, the column of manta rays creates its own vortex, drawing and delivering the plankton straight into the cavernous mouths of the rays.
The experience of diving among these countless rays is absolutely unforgettable.
The first time I photographed Hanifaru, the site was unprotected and threatened by development.
I have worked with NGOs like the Manta Trust, and my photographs have contributed to making Hanifaru a protected marine area.
Fishers from neighboring islands were hunting these manta rays, using their skin to make traditional drums.
Today, they are the most ardent conservationists and the manta rays contribute over 8 million dollars to the Maldivian economy each year.
I've always wanted to go back in time and see an era when maps were incomplete or marked with: "Here be dragons."
I came closest to achieving this by visiting these remote atolls in the heart of the Indian Ocean.
Far, very far, from ship lanes and fishing lines, diving in these waters is a poignant reminder of what our oceans once looked like.
Bassas da India is largely unknown. It's a tiny patch of coral in the Mozambique Channel.
Its barrier forms a shield that protects its inner lagoon, a nursery for Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are anything but shy, even during the day.
Something told me they would be even bolder and more numerous at night.
I found myself confronted by more sharks than ever before, gathered around a single outcrop.
Photographing and sharing moments like these reminds me why I chose this path.
Not long ago, I was working on a project in Baja California for National Geographic.
Halfway down the Pacific coast lies San Ignacio Lagoon, where the gray whale comes to give birth.
For a century, this coast was the site of a systematic massacre, with over 20,000 gray whales killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
Today, the descendants of those same whales play at the surface with their offspring, and they even interact with us.
This species has remarkably survived.
On the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo, a sleepy fishing village.
Decades of overfishing have brought them to the brink of collapse.
In 1995, the local fishermen convinced the authorities to turn their waters into a marine reserve.
But what happened next can only be described as a miracle.
In 2005, after just a decade of protection, scientists recorded the largest increase in fish populations.
But don't take my word for it, come with me.
In a single breath, dive with me into the depths, amidst one of the largest and densest schools of fish I have ever encountered.
We all have the ability to inspire hope.
And through my photographs, I want to convey the message that it's not too late for our oceans.
And I would particularly like to emphasize the resilience of nature in the face of 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I will have to search relentlessly to take photos like this one, while creating images that show our respectful coexistence with the ocean that,
I hope, will become everyday for me. 
To thrive and survive in my line of work, you really have to be an unshakeable optimist.
I keep working with the belief that the next incredible image that will serve my purpose is just around the corner, right behind the next reef, at the heart of the next lagoon, or who knows, maybe in the one after that.
