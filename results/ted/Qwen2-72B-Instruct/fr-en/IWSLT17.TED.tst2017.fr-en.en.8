When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the heart of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
The new government, emerging from a long war of independence, immediately announced a socialist program: health services, primary education became essentially free.
A significant expansion of rural health centers placed approximately 80% of the population within less than a two-hour walk from one of these centers, a truly remarkable achievement.
In 1980, the year of independence, 25% of Zimbabwe's children were fully immunized.
In 1990, a decade later, this proportion had risen to 80%.
I felt extremely privileged to be part of this transformation, this revolution.
The excitement, the camaraderie were tangible.
Working with brilliant Zimbabweans - scientists, doctors, activists - I felt connected not only to an African independence movement, but to a global progressive movement for public health.
But there were considerable challenges.
Zimbabwe reported its first case of AIDS in 1985, the year of my arrival.
I had cared for a few AIDS patients in the early 1980s, during my medical training at Harlem Hospital, but - we had no idea of what was awaiting Africa.
In my early days there, the infection rate was 2%.
This would skyrocket and reach one in four adults by the time of my departure from Harare, 17 years later.
In the mid-90s, I had informed hundreds of people in the prime of their life that they were HIV positive.
I had seen friends and colleagues, my students, patients at the hospital, die.
In response to this, my colleagues and I set up a clinic.
We were demonstrating the use of condoms.
We launched education in schools, interventions in the workplace.
We were conducting research. We were giving advice to the partners of infected men on how to protect themselves.
We worked hard, and at the time, I thought I was doing my best.
I was providing excellent care, as good as it could be.
But I wasn't talking about structural change.
The former UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, spoke candidly about his personal failure that led to the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was the head of the peace department at the UN.
At a memorial ten years later, he said: "At the time, I believed I was doing my best, but after the genocide, I realized that I could and should have done more to sound the alarm and rally support."
The AIDS epidemic caught the health community off guard, and today, with the World Health Organization estimating that 39 million people have died from this disease, I am not alone in harboring regrets and remorse for not having done more, sooner.
But when I lived in Zimbabwe, I did not see my role as that of an advocate or a policymaker.
I was there for my technical skills, my clinical expertise, and my epidemiological research.
For me, my job was to take care of the patients and conduct research to better understand the patterns of transmission within the population, and I hoped that we would slow down the spread of the virus.
I was aware that marginalized communities were at high risk of contracting and dying from AIDS.
And in the sugar plantations, which up close resembled feudal fiefs more than any modern enterprise, 60% of pregnant women were HIV-positive.
I worked to demonstrate that being infected was not a moral failure but rather tied to a culture of male superiority, forced labor of immigrants, and colonialism.
The whites were largely spared.
As health professionals, our tools were woefully inadequate: beseeching people to change individual behavior, to use condoms, to reduce the number of partners.
Infection rates were skyrocketing. And when treatment became available in the West, a treatment that remained our most potent weapon against the virus, it was not affordable for the African public sector.
I did not denounce the unequal access to these life-saving drugs or the underlying economic and political systems that were driving up infection rates in large segments of the population.
I rationalized my silence by telling myself that I was just a visitor in this country, that sounding the alarm could get me expelled, prevent me from doing my job, taking care of my patients, conducting much-needed research.
So I did not rebel against the government's initial stance on AIDS.
I did not voice my concerns aloud.
Many doctors and health professionals may think that I did nothing wrong.
Our covenant with our patients, the Hippocratic Oath and its variations, speaks to the inviolability of the doctor-patient relationship.
I did everything I could for each of the patients I had.
But I knew that epidemics emerge along the fractures of our society, reflecting not just our biology, but more notably patterns of marginalization, exclusion, and discrimination based on race, gender, sexuality, class, etc.
This was true for AIDS.
This was recently true for Ebola.
Medical anthropologists like Paul Farmer, who worked on AIDS in Haiti, have termed this "structural violence." Structural because inequalities are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world, often invisible to those who are privileged and in power; and violent because its impact—premature deaths, suffering, illness—is indeed violent.
We do little for our patients if we do not recognize these social injustices.
Sounding the alarm is the first step towards good public health practice, and it is how we might mobilize support to revolutionize and create change together.
Today, I am not silent.
I speak of many things, even if they make those who listen uncomfortable, even if they make me uncomfortable.
Much of what I say pertains to racial disparities and institutionalized racism, issues that are no longer supposed to exist in this country, let alone in medical practice or public health.
But they exist, and we pay for them by shortening lives.
That is why sounding the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the United States, the current institutional and interpersonal violence faced by people of color, intertwined with our grim legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow, and 60 years of imperfect equality, sounding the alarm about this is fundamental to properly fulfilling my role as New York City's Health Commissioner.
In New York, premature mortality - dying before reaching 65 years of age - is 50% higher for Black men than for White men.
In 2012, a Black woman was ten times more likely than a White woman to die during childbirth.
Although we have made tremendous progress in reducing infant mortality rates, a black baby still has nearly three times the risk of a white baby of dying in its first year.
New York is no exception.
These statistics are compared with figures across the United States.
A recent analysis by The New York Times reported that there were, in the country,
1.5 million missing Black men. They pointed out that more than one in six Black men who would now be between the ages of 25 and 54 is no longer living a normal life, but is instead in prison or has died prematurely.
There is a great injustice in the disproportionate and daily violence against young Black men, which has been the focus of recent #BlackLivesMatter protests.
But we must remember that persistent disparate rates and the incidence and outcome of common diseases - heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV - diseases that can kill slowly and silently, continue to claim even more black lives prematurely.
When the #BlackLivesMatter movement took shape, I was frustrated and angry that the medical community was reluctant to use the word "racism" in our research and work.
You must have felt something every time I said it.
Our students joined white coat protests, but the medical community largely stood aside as ongoing discrimination continues to impact disease patterns and mortality.
And I fear that the trend toward personalized and precise medicine, the quest for biological or genetic targets for more tailored treatment, might inadvertently cause us to lose sight of the big picture, namely the everyday context in which a person lives, grows, works, and loves—the fundamental factor in determining the health of the population: for far too many of us, poor health.
As health professionals, in our daily work, be it in practice or in research, we bear witness to a great injustice: the homeless who are unable to follow medical advice because they have other priorities; the transgender youth who contemplate suicide because our society is too rigid; the single mother made to feel responsible for her child's poor health status.
Our role as health professionals is not merely to treat our patients but to sound the alarm and promote change.
Regardless of whether we deserve it or not, our standing in society makes us highly credible, and we should not squander this.
I regret not speaking out in Zimbabwe, and I have vowed that as New York City's Health Commissioner, I will seize every opportunity to sound the alarm and garner support for health equity.
I will call out racism, and I hope you will join me, and I will join you in calling out sexism or any other form of inequality.
It is time for us to stand up and, as a community, denounce the structural inequalities.
We do not need to have all the answers to call for change.
We only need courage.
The health of our patients, of each one of us, depends on it.
