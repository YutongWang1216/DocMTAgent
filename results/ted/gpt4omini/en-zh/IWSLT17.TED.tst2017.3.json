The author contrasts their typical approach—starting slowly and ramping up work as deadlines approached—with the challenge of completing a 90-page senior thesis, which required a more structured plan. They initially intended to pace themselves like a staircase, gradually increasing their efforts over the year. However, despite this planning, they found themselves unable to follow through during the initial months, leading to the need for a revised strategy. The overall domain is academic life and time management, conveyed in a conversational and relatable tone.",

        "new_src_summary": "The author, Tim Urban, reflects on his experience as a government major in college, particularly the challenges he faced in managing time and workload while writing papers. He contrasts his usual approach of gradually ramping up work as deadlines approached with the daunting task of completing a 90-page senior thesis, which necessitated a more structured plan. Although he initially aimed to pace himself like a staircase throughout the year, he struggled to adhere to this strategy in the early months. Ultimately, he found himself in a frantic 72-hour sprint, pulling two all-nighters to finish the thesis, which he humorously admits turned out poorly, contrary to expectations. Urban then transitions to his current role as a writer and blogger for \"Wait But Why,\" where he delves into procrastination. He expresses a desire to bridge the understanding gap between procrastinators and non-procrastinators, hypothesizing that they may have different brain functions. To explore this idea, he arranged for both his brain and that of a non-procrastinator to be scanned in an MRI lab for comparison. The overall domain encompasses academic life, procrastination, and self-reflection, conveyed through a conversational and relatable tone, infused with humor to engage readers.",

        "new_src_summary": "Tim Urban, reflecting on his college experience as a government major, recounts the challenges of managing time and workload while writing papers, particularly the daunting task of completing a 90-page senior thesis. He contrasts his typical approach of gradually ramping up work with the need for a structured plan, ultimately leading to a frantic 72-hour sprint filled with all-nighters, which he humorously admits resulted in a disappointing outcome. Transitioning to his current role as a writer and blogger for \"Wait But Why,\" Urban explores procrastination, aiming to bridge the understanding gap between procrastinators and non-procrastinators. He hypothesizes that their brains function differently, which he investigates by arranging for MRI scans of both his brain and that of a non-procrastinator. This exploration includes a metaphorical comparison between the two types, highlighting that while both have a Rational Decision-Maker, procrastinators are also hindered by an \"Instant Gratification Monkey\" that prioritizes immediate pleasures over important tasks. The overall domain encompasses academic life, psychology, and self-reflection, focusing on decision-making and procrastination behaviors, all conveyed through a conversational and relatable tone infused with humor to engage readers.",

        "new_src_summary": "Tim Urban reflects on his college experience as a government major, recounting the challenges of managing time and workload while writing papers, particularly the daunting task of completing a 90-page senior thesis. He contrasts his typical approach of gradually ramping up work with the need for a structured plan, ultimately leading to a frantic 72-hour sprint filled with all-nighters, which he humorously admits resulted in a disappointing outcome. Transitioning to his current role as a writer and blogger for \"Wait But Why,\" Urban explores procrastination, aiming to bridge the understanding gap between procrastinators and non-procrastinators. He hypothesizes that their brains function differently, investigating this by arranging MRI scans of both his brain and that of a non-procrastinator. He introduces a metaphorical comparison, highlighting that while both types have a Rational Decision-Maker, procrastinators are hindered by an \"Instant Gratification Monkey\" that prioritizes immediate pleasures over important tasks. This conflict between instinctual behavior and rational decision-making also leads to the creation of the \"Dark Playground,\" a metaphorical space where procrastinators engage in leisure activities at inappropriate times, emphasizing the struggle between short-term enjoyment and long-term responsibilities. The overall domain encompasses academic life, psychology, and self-reflection, focusing on decision-making and procrastination behaviors, all conveyed through a conversational and relatable tone infused with humor to engage readers.",

        "new_src_summary": "Tim Urban reflects on his college experience as a government major, recounting the challenges of managing time and workload while writing papers, particularly the daunting task of completing a 90-page senior thesis. He contrasts his typical approach of gradually ramping up work with the need for a structured plan, ultimately leading to a frantic 72-hour sprint filled with all-nighters, which he humorously admits resulted in a disappointing outcome. Transitioning to his current role as a writer and blogger for \"Wait But Why,\" Urban explores procrastination through a metaphorical framework involving an \"Instant Gratification Monkey\" that prioritizes immediate pleasures over important tasks and a \"Panic Monster\" that motivates action under pressure. He aims to bridge the understanding gap between procrastinators and non-procrastinators, hypothesizing that their brains function differently and investigating this by arranging MRI scans of both his brain and that of a non-procrastinator. Urban introduces the concept of the \"Dark Playground,\" a metaphorical space where procrastinators engage in leisure activities at inappropriate times, highlighting the struggle between short-term enjoyment and long-term responsibilities. He illustrates this conflict through a personal anecdote about preparing for a TED Talk, showcasing the tension between the Rational Decision-Maker, who recognizes the need to prepare, and the Monkey, who distracts with trivial activities. As deadlines approach, the Panic Monster awakens, instigating a sense of urgency that allows the Rational Decision-Maker to finally take control. The overall domain encompasses academic life, psychology, and self-reflection, focusing on decision-making and procrastination behaviors, conveyed through a conversational and relatable tone infused with humor to engage readers while capturing the common challenges of procrastination.",

        "new_src_summary": "Tim Urban reflects on his college experience as a government major, grappling with the challenges of managing time and workload, particularly when faced with the daunting task of completing a 90-page senior thesis. He contrasts his usual gradual approach to work with the necessity for a structured plan, ultimately resulting in a frantic 72-hour sprint filled with all-nighters, which he humorously admits led to a disappointing outcome. Transitioning to his current role as a writer and blogger for \"Wait But Why,\" Urban delves into the phenomenon of procrastination through a metaphorical framework that includes the \"Instant Gratification Monkey,\" which prioritizes immediate pleasures over important tasks, and the \"Panic Monster,\" which motivates action under pressure. He aims to bridge the understanding gap between procrastinators and non-procrastinators, hypothesizing that their brains function differently, and investigates this by arranging MRI scans of both his brain and that of a non-procrastinator. Urban introduces the concept of the \"Dark Playground,\" a metaphorical space where procrastinators engage in leisure activities at inappropriate times, highlighting the struggle between short-term enjoyment and long-term responsibilities. He illustrates this conflict through a personal anecdote about preparing for a TED Talk, showcasing the tension between the Rational Decision-Maker, who recognizes the need to prepare, and the Monkey, who distracts with trivial activities. As deadlines approach, the Panic Monster awakens, instigating a sense of urgency that allows the Rational Decision-Maker to take control. The discussion resonates widely, evidenced by thousands of emails from individuals across various professions expressing shared struggles with procrastination. Urban contrasts the lighthearted tone of his blog with the serious frustrations conveyed in these emails, prompting a deeper examination of procrastination's impact. He identifies two types of procrastination: one linked to deadlines that activates the Panic Monster and mitigates short-term consequences, and another that lacks deadlines, common in creative or self-directed careers, where the absence of urgency leads to prolonged negative effects. Overall, the text encompasses themes of academic life, psychology, self-help, and productivity, conveyed through a reflective, conversational tone infused with humor, engaging readers while capturing the common challenges of procrastination.",
        "new_tgt_summary": "在大学时，作者主修政府专业，需撰写大量论文。尽管最初计划轻松工作，但随着90页毕业论文的临近，作者意识到常规工作流程无法应对论文接踵而至的压力。他制定了新的计划，打算在初期放松，中期加大力度，最终全力以赴。然而，几个月过去，作者未能如愿完成任务，促使其调整修订计划。在论文截止日期前，作者经历了紧张的72小时，最终完成了90页的论文，结果却非常糟糕。接到学校的电话时，他原以为会得到赞赏，结果并非如此。如今，作为作家和博主，他写博客《等等，为什么》，探讨拖延症，并试图向不拖延者解释拖延者的思维过程。作者通过展示自己的大脑与不拖延者的大脑，指出两者都有理性的决策者，但拖延者的大脑中还存在一个追求即时满足的“猴子”，这种“猴子”在面对需要完成的任务时，会干扰理性的决策，导致个体选择更为轻松和有趣的活动，而忽视应完成的工作。尽管简单有趣的活动如吃饭和休息是生活的一部分，但为了长远利益，有时需要做更困难的事情。这种内心冲突导致拖延者沉迷于轻松的“黑暗游乐场”，即在不适合休闲的时刻进行休闲活动，从而偏离理性的生活方式。在“黑暗游乐场”中，拖延者所体验的乐趣并不是真正的快乐，因为它伴随着愧疚和焦虑。当“猴子”控制决策时，拖延者难以迈向重要的任务区域。然而，拖延者有一个“守护天使”——“恐慌怪兽”，在截止日期临近时会醒来并促使拖延者行动。作者分享了自己在TED演讲邀请下的经历，指出拖延者通常在有截止日期的情况下能够找到动力，但在没有截止日期的任务中，拖延问题更为严重，许多人在面对拖延时感到挫败，尤其是在没有明确时间限制的职业和个人事务中，这导致拖延的影响不断扩展。文中提到，拖延分为两种类型，强调在自我激励的工作中，缺乏截止日期可能使拖延行为更加普遍和难以克服。",

        "new_src_summary": "Tim Urban reflects on his college experience as a government major, grappling with the challenges of managing time and workload, particularly the daunting task of completing a 90-page senior thesis. He contrasts his usual gradual approach to work with the necessity for a structured plan, ultimately leading to a frantic 72-hour sprint filled with all-nighters, which humorously resulted in a disappointing outcome. Transitioning to his role as a writer and blogger for \"Wait But Why,\" Urban delves into procrastination using a metaphorical framework that includes the \"Instant Gratification Monkey,\" which prioritizes immediate pleasures over important tasks, and the \"Panic Monster,\" which motivates action under pressure. He aims to bridge the understanding gap between procrastinators and non-procrastinators, hypothesizing that their brains function differently, and investigates this through MRI scans of his brain and that of a non-procrastinator. Urban introduces the \"Dark Playground,\" a metaphorical space where procrastinators engage in leisure activities at inappropriate times, highlighting the struggle between short-term enjoyment and long-term responsibilities. He illustrates this conflict through a personal anecdote about preparing for a TED Talk, showcasing the tension between the Rational Decision-Maker and the Monkey, with the Panic Monster awakening as deadlines approach to instigate urgency. This discussion resonates widely, evidenced by thousands of emails from individuals across various professions expressing shared struggles with procrastination. Urban identifies two types of procrastination: short-term, linked to deadlines that activate the Panic Monster, and long-term, which lacks urgency and is common in creative or self-directed careers, leading to significant unhappiness and regret. He emphasizes that everyone struggles with procrastination, even those who appear organized, and concludes with a call to reflect on life priorities using a \"Life Calendar\" to illustrate the limited time available in a typical lifespan. The overall text encompasses themes of academic life, psychology, self-help, and productivity, conveyed through a reflective, conversational tone infused with humor, encouraging readers to confront their procrastination while capturing the common challenges faced in pursuing dreams.",
        "new_tgt_summary": "在大学时，作者主修政府专业，需撰写大量论文。尽管最初计划轻松工作，但随着90页毕业论文的临近，作者意识到常规工作流程无法应对论文接踵而至的压力。他制定了新的计划，打算在初期放松，中期加大力度，最终全力以赴。然而，几个月过去，作者未能如愿完成任务，促使其调整修订计划。在论文截止日期前，作者经历了紧张的72小时，最终完成了90页的论文，结果却非常糟糕。接到学校的电话时，他原以为会得到赞赏，结果并非如此。如今，作为作家和博主，他写博客《等等，为什么》，探讨拖延症，并试图向不拖延者解释拖延者的思维过程。作者通过展示自己的大脑与不拖延者的大脑，指出两者都有理性的决策者，但拖延者的大脑中还存在一个追求即时满足的“猴子”，这种“猴子”在面对需要完成的任务时，会干扰理性的决策，导致个体选择更为轻松和有趣的活动，而忽视应完成的工作。尽管简单有趣的活动如吃饭和休息是生活的一部分，但为了长远利益，有时需要做更困难的事情。这种内心冲突导致拖延者沉迷于轻松的“黑暗游乐场”，即在不适合休闲的时刻进行休闲活动，从而偏离理性的生活方式。在“黑暗游乐场”中，拖延者所体验的乐趣并不是真正的快乐，因为它伴随着愧疚和焦虑。当“猴子”控制决策时，拖延者难以迈向重要的任务区域。然而，拖延者有一个“守护天使”——“恐慌怪兽”，在截止日期临近时会醒来并促使拖延者行动。作者分享了自己在TED演讲邀请下的经历，指出拖延者通常在有截止日期的情况下能够找到动力，但在没有截止日期的任务中，拖延问题更为严重，许多人在面对拖延时感到挫败，尤其是在没有明确时间限制的职业和个人事务中，这导致拖延的影响不断扩展。同时，长期拖延症比短期拖延症更隐蔽，常在私密中忍受，可能导致长期的不快乐和遗憾。人们在生活中常感到像旁观者，无法迈出追逐梦想的第一步。作者认为每个人都有拖延的倾向，强调需要认真审视自己的生活日历，警惕即时满足的诱惑，并建议从现在开始重视这一问题。文中提到，拖延分为两种类型，强调在自我激励的工作中，缺乏截止日期可能使拖延行为更加普遍和难以克服。",
