The food crisis
is in the news every day.
But what is it?
In some parts of the world, there is too little food, or perhaps too much.
Elsewhere, GMOs are saving the world.
Perhaps GMOs are the problem?
Excessive agricultural runoff creates toxic oceans, the decline of food supply.
And so on.
I find the current climate of this discussion incredibly discouraging.
How can we bring this topic back to something we understand?
What does this apple tell us about the food crisis?
You all ate an apple last week, I'm sure.
How old do you think she was when she was picked?
Two weeks?
Two months?
Eleven months. That's the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the United States.
And I don't think that it's very different in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
We pick them, we put them in cold storage, we gas the warehouses. There is actually documented evidence of workers attempting to enter these environments to retrieve an apple, and who die because the atmosphere used to slow the ripening of the apple is toxic to humans.
How is it that none of you knew about this?
Why didn't I know about this?
90% of the quality of this apple, all the antioxidants, are gone by the time it arrives at our place.
In fact, it is nothing more than a small ball of sugar.
How do we have so little information and how can we do better?
I think what is missing is a platform.
I know about platforms. I know about computers. I was put in front of the Internet when I was young.
I have done some very strange things... ... on this platform.
But I met people, and I was able to express myself.
How can we express ourselves in food?
If we had a platform, we could feel empowered to ask: If only?
I wondered: What if... the climate were democratic?
So, here is a map of the climate in the world.
The most productive areas in green, the least productive in red.
They change, they replace each other, and the California farmers are now Mexican.
China is taking land in Brazil to grow better food, and we are the slaves of the climate.
What if each country had its own productive climate?
What would that change about the way we live?
What would that change for the quality of life and food?
The problem of the previous generation was to have more food and to have it cheaper.
Welcome to your global farm.
We have built a massive analog farm.
All these lines, they are the cars, the planes, the trains, and transportation.
It is a miracle that we feed seven billion people with only a few of us involved in food production.
And what would happen if...
we built a digital farm?
A global digital farm.
And what if you could take this apple, somehow digitize it, send it in particle form through the air, and reassemble it on the other side?
What would happen?
Let's revisit a few quotes. They inspire me in what I do.
The first: "Japanese agriculture has no childhood, no water, no land, and no future." This is what I discovered when I went to Minamisanriku, south of Fukushima, after the disaster.
The children have gone to Sendai and Tokyo, the land is contaminated, and they are already importing 70% of their own food.
But this does not concern only Japan.
2% of the American population is involved in agriculture.
What good response can come from only 2% of the population?
By traveling around the world, 50% of the African population is under 18 years old.
80% of them do not want to become farmers.
Agriculture is difficult.
The life of a small agricultural entrepreneur is miserable.
They are heading towards the city.
In India, farmers do not have access to basic services. There have been more farmer suicides this year than in the previous ten years.
It feels uncomfortable to talk about it.
Where are they going?
To the city.
There are no young people left, and everyone is leaving.
So, how can we build a platform that would inspire young people?
Welcome to the new tractor.
This is my combine harvester.
A few years ago now, I went to Bed Bath & Beyond and Home Depot and started hacking.
I built stupid things, I made the plants dance, I connected them to my computer, and I killed them all; I killed many of them.
I finally managed to keep them alive.
And I created one of the most intimate relationships of my entire existence because I was learning the language of plants.
I wanted to do bigger.
I was told, "Have fun, young man!"
Here is an old electronics lab that nobody wants.
"What can you do?"
With my team, we built a farm inside the Media Lab, a place renowned not for biology, but rather for computer science.
Inside these 6 square meters, we produced enough food to feed about 300 people once a month. That's little food.
There are plenty of interesting technologies in there.
But the most interesting thing?
Beautiful roots, white, deep green colors, and a monthly harvest.
Is it a new cafeteria?
Is it a new retail experience?
Is it a new grocery store?
I can assure you of one thing: this is the first time someone in the Media Lab has pulled up the roots of anything.
We have pre-packaged salads; there’s nothing wrong with that.
But what happens when you have an image processing expert, a data specialist, and a roboticist pulling up roots and thinking, "I know a thing or two. I can do this, I want to give it a try."
In this context, we would grow the plants and bring some back to the lab, because if you grow them, you don’t throw them away; you become attached to them.
I have funny taste buds now; I'm afraid to let anyone eat something without having tasted it first because I want it to be good.
I eat lettuce every day, and I can give its pH to within 0.1.
And I say, "No, its pH is 6.1; you can't eat it today."
That lettuce that day was incredibly sweet.
It was incredibly sweet because the plant was stressed and it triggered a chemical reaction within itself to protect itself: "I am not going to die!"
And the plants that do not want to die seem sweet to me.
Technologists are taken aback by plant physiology.
We thought that other people should be able to give it a try.
We wanted to see what people can create, so we designed a lab that can be shipped anywhere.
Then we built it.
On the facade of the Media Lab, there is my lab, which has about 30 detection points per plant.
If you know the genome or genetics, that's the phenome, okay?
The phenomena.
When you say, "I love strawberries from Mexico," you really love the strawberries from the climate that produced the expression you like.
So, if you code the climate - this amount of CO2 and this amount of oxygen create a recipe - you code the expression of that plant, the nutrition of that plant, its size, shape, color, and texture.
We need data, so we installed a bunch of sensors to tell us what is happening.
Think of your houseplants! You feel really sad because you’re wondering, "Why are you dying? Why don’t you talk to me?"
Farmers acquire a unique capability when they reach the age of 60 or 70.
They can tell when a plant is dying that it is due to a nitrogen deficiency, a calcium deficiency, or that it needs more water.
This unique capability is not passed on.
Here are the signs of the "farmer in the cloud."
We track this data over time.
We correlate them with specific plants.
These are all the broccoli in my lab, by IP address.
Our broccoli can be accessed by IP address.
And if that’s not strange enough, you click once and get the profile of a plant.
And it gives you the downloadable evolution of this plant, but not as you might think, not just when it is ready.
When does it reach the nutrition that I need?
When does it reach the desired taste?
Is it receiving too much water?
Is it receiving too much sunlight?
Alerts.
It can talk to me, it communicates, we have a language.
I think she is the first user of the plants' Facebook!
It's her plant profile, and this plant is going to start making friends.
I think she will become friends with other plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, and less potassium.
We will learn more about a complexity that we could only assume.
Perhaps they will not become our friends, perhaps they will; it will depend on us.
This is my lab.
He is a bit more organized; my job is to design data centers for hospitals, so I am well acquainted with creating controlled environments.
And so, inside this environment, we experiment with all sorts of things.
This aeroponic process was developed by NASA for the Mir space station to reduce the amount of water sent into space.
This process gives the plant exactly what it wants: water, minerals, and oxygen.
The roots aren't that complicated. When you give them this, you get an amazing result.
It's as if the plant had two hearts.
And because it has two hearts, it grows four or five times faster.
It's a perfect world.
We have made progress in technology and seeds for an unfavorable world, and we will continue to do so, but we also have a new tool, which is a perfect world.
We have grown all sorts of things.
These tomatoes had not been produced and sold for 150 years.
Do you know that we have banks of rare and ancient seeds?
Seed banks.
It's incredible.
They have genetic material, things you have never eaten.
I am the only person in this room who has eaten this kind of tomato.
It's a sauce tomato that we don't know how to cook. We ate this tomato. And it wasn't great.
We have done things with proteins, all sorts of things.
We have grown humans. Perhaps you would do it, but we haven't.
What we realized is that the tool was too big and too expensive.
I began to distribute it around the world, and it cost about $100,000.
Finding someone with $100,000 in their pocket is not easy, so we sought to make it smaller.
It was the project of one of my undergraduate mechanical engineering students, Camille.
Camille and I, along with the whole team, tried all summer to find a way to make it cheaper, to make it work better, and to enable others to do it.
We placed them in schools, from sixth grade to senior year.
And if you want to stay humble, try teaching children.
I went to the school and said, "Set the humidity to 65%."
A middle school student asked me, "What is humidity?"
I replied, "Water in the air."
He said, "There is no water in the air, you are an idiot."
And I replied, "Very well...
Don't trust me.
"Set it to 100."
He sets it to 100, and what happens?
It starts to condense, creating fog and, eventually, droplets.
And he says, "Oh. Humidity is rain."
"Why didn't you tell me?"
We created an interface like that of a game.
They have a 3D environment, and they can connect from anywhere in the world using their smartphone or tablet.
They have the different parts of the bots, the sensors.
They choose recipes created by other children from around the world.
They select and activate this recipe, they plant a seedling.
While it grows, they make changes.
"Why does a plant need CO2?"
"Is CO2 bad? It kills people!"
"Increase the CO2, the plant dies."
"Reduce the CO2, the plant is doing very well."
Harvest the plant, you have just created a new digital recipe.
It is a design, an iterative development, and a process of exploration.
They can download all the data on this new plant they have developed or the new digital recipe and what it has done – was it better or worse?
Imagine this as the little hearts of the process.
We are going to learn so much.
Here is one of the food computers, as we call them, in a school after three weeks.
It's three weeks of growth.
But more importantly, it was the first time that kid thought he could be a farmer - or that he might want to be a farmer.
We made everything open source.
Everything is online; try to build your first food computer.
It's going to be difficult - I'm telling you.
We are at the beginning, but everything is here.
It is very important to me that it is easily accessible.
We will continue to move in this direction.
These are farmers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, plant scientists, economists, urban planners,
on a unique platform, doing what they are good at.
But we have seen a little too big.
This is my new installation that has just been launched.
This warehouse could be anywhere.
That's why I chose it.
And inside this warehouse, we are going to build something a bit like this.
They already exist.
Look.
They also exist.
One allows for the growth of greens, the other enables the production of the Ebola vaccine.
It's cool that this factory, a big winner of the DARPA challenge, is one of the reasons for the progress on Ebola.
The factories produce the protein that resists the Ebola virus.
Pharmaceutical products, nutraceuticals, down to simple lettuce.
But these two things are nothing alike, and that's where I excel in my field.
Everything is different.
We are at this strange stage of "We're almost there." It's a bit like, "Here’s my black box. -- No, buy mine."
-- No, no - I have the intellectual property, quite valid.
"Don't buy theirs, buy mine."
In fact, we are just at the beginning, at a moment when society is also changing.
As we ask for more food but at lower prices, we are demanding better food that respects the environment.
When you have a McDonald's ad explaining what’s in the McNuggets—the most mysterious food product of all time—on which their marketing campaign is based, everything is changing.
From now on,
personal food computers, food servers, and food data centers operate on the open phenotype.
Think open genome, but we will add small climate recipes, like Wikipedia, that you can retrieve, update, and grow.
What does it look like in reality?
Do you remember the planet connected by lines?
We are starting to have the markers.
We are starting to send information about food, rather than sending food.
This is not only my dream; these are the places where we are already deploying.
Food computers, food servers, soon food data centers, connecting people to share information.
The future of food is not to fight against what is wrong.
We know what is wrong.
The future of food lies in networking the next billion farmers and empowering them through a platform to ask and answer the question, "What if?"
Thank you.
