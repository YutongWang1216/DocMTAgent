It's a story about how we know what we know.
It's a story about this woman Natalia Rybczynski.
She is a paleobiologist, which means she specializes in digging up old dead things.
Natalia Rybczynski: Yes, sometimes I've been called "Dr. Dead Things."
Latif Nasser: I think she is interesting because of the place where she works, well above the Arctic Circle in the remote tundra of Canada.
One summer day in 2006, she was at a dig site called Fyles Leaf Bed, which is less than 10 degrees of latitude from the magnetic North Pole.
NR: Honestly, it doesn't sound exciting because it was a day of hiking with a backpack, a GPS, and a notebook, and we were collecting anything that could be a fossil.
LN: And at one point, she noticed something.
NR: Rusty, rust-colored, about the size of my palm.
It was just lying on the ground.
LN: And at first, she thought it was just a splinter, like those found at Fyles Leaf Bed before—pieces of prehistoric plants.
But that evening, back at the camp, ...
NR: ... I take out a magnifying glass, I look at it more closely and I realize that it doesn't have the growth rings of a tree.
It may be its preservation, but it really looks like...
a bone.
LN: Thus, during the four years that followed, she returned to that spot numerous times, and in the end, she collected 30 fragments of the same bone, most of them very small.
NR: It's not that much. It fits into a small plastic bag.
LN: And she tried to piece them together like a puzzle.
But it was stimulating.
NR: It's all broken into so many small pieces, I'm trying with sand and putty, but in vain.
So in the end, we used a 3D surface scanner.
LN: Ooh! NR: Yes, exactly.
LN: But it was easier to do it virtually.
NR: It's a bit magical when everything comes together.
LN: How did you know it was right, that they were pieced together correctly?
Could it have been possible to piece them together differently to create a parakeet or something else?
NR: Um, no. No, it could only be that.
LN: She discovered that what she had was a tibia, a leg bone, and specifically, the bone of a hoofed mammal, so something like a cow or a sheep.
But it couldn't be one of those.
It was just too big.
NR: The size of this thing was enormous. It's a very large animal.
LN: So, what animal could it be?
In the dead end, she showed one of the fragments to her colleagues in Colorado, and they had an idea.
NR: We took a saw and just made a notch on the edge, and there was this very interesting smell that came out.
LN: It smelled like charred flesh.
It was a smell that Natalia recognized after having cut up quite a few skulls in her disgusting anatomy lab: collagen.
Collagen is what gives our bones their structure.
And generally, after so many years, it decomposes.
But in this case, the Arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it.
Then, a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol, and she saw that one of her colleagues, Mike Buckley, was presenting a new method called "collagen fingerprinting."
It turns out that all species have slightly different collagen structures, so if we have the collagen profile of an unknown bone, we can compare it to that of known species, and who knows, maybe they will match.
So she sent him one of the fragments via FedEx.
NR: Yes, we wanted to follow it. It was quite important.
LN: He studied it and compared it to 37 known species of modern mammals.
And he found a match.
It turns out that the 3.5-million-year-old bone that Natalia unearthed from the High Arctic belonged to...
a camel.
NR: And I was thinking, "That's great -- if it's true."
LN: They tested several fragments, and they got the same result each time.
However, based on the size of the bone they had found, this camel appeared to be 30% larger than modern camels.
So this camel would have been nearly 2.80 meters tall and weighed almost a ton.
And yes.
Natalia had found a giant Arctic camel.
Well, when you hear the word "camel," what should come to mind is one of those, the Bactrian camel from East and Central Asia.
But you might have in mind a postcard image like this, the dromedary, the typical animal of the desert—which lives in the sands of hot places, such as the Middle East or the Sahara, with a large hump on its back where it stores water for its caravans, and with big, wide feet that help it climb the sand dunes.
So, how do we explain that one of them ended up in the High Arctic?
In fact, scientists had long known, even before Natalia's discovery, that camels originally came from America.
They started here.
For 40 of the 45 million years that camels have existed, they could only be found in North America, around 20 different species, perhaps more.
If we aligned them all, would we see any differences?
NR: Yes, the bodies will have different sizes.
You will have ones with very long necks, which will actually be like giraffes.
LN: Some had mouths like crocodiles.
NR: The most primitive ones would have been very small, almost like rabbits.
LN: What? Camels the size of a rabbit?
NR: The oldest.
So you probably wouldn't recognize them.
LN: Good grief, I want a rabbit-camel.
NR: I know, that would be great.
LN: And three to seven million years ago, one branch of camels descended into South America, where they became llamas and alpacas, while another branch crossed the land bridge from Bering to Asia and Africa.
And at the end of the last ice age, North American camels went extinct.
So the scientists already knew all of this, but it doesn't really explain why Natalia found one so far North.
Because, in terms of temperature, it is exactly the opposite of the Sahara.
To be honest, 3.5 million years ago, the average temperature was 22°C warmer than today.
So there would have been a boreal forest, more like today's Yukon or Siberia.
But still, they would have had winters lasting 6 months during which the ponds were frozen.
There would have been blizzards.
There would have been 24-hour days completely immersed in darkness.
So, how... How?
How is it possible that one of these superstars of the Sahara could survive in this Arctic environment?
Natalia and her colleagues think they have an answer.
And it's pretty great.
And if the characteristics that enable the camel to adapt so well to places like the Sahara actually evolved to help it endure the winter?
And if these large feet were made not for walking on sand, but in the snow, like a pair of snowshoes?
And if this hump—which, by the way, big news for me, does not contain water, but fat—was there to help the camel endure those six-month winters when food is scarce?
And then, only later, after crossing the land bridge, did he use these characteristics to adapt them to the burning deserts?
For example, the hump can be useful for camels in desert climates because having all their fat in one place, like a backpack of fat, means they don't have that insulating layer over the rest of their body.
So the heat dissipates more easily.
It's this crazy idea that the attributes of the camel, which we believe demonstrate its desert nature, might actually be evidence of its past in the Arctic.
So, I am not the first to tell this story.
Some have spoken about it to embellish the biology of evolution or to provide insight into the future of climate change.
But I love it for entirely different reasons.
For me, it's a story that speaks about us, about how we see the world and how that changes.
I have a degree in history.
And I learned that in fact many scientists are also historians.
They give meaning to the past.
They tell the story of our universe, our planet, and the life on it.
And as a historian, one starts with a certain idea of how history unfolds.
NR: We create stories, and that's all, like the camel in the desert.
It's a great story! It fits perfectly with the idea.
They apparently have always lived there.
LN: But at any moment, we can discover a tiny piece of evidence.
We can learn a tiny thing that will force us to rethink everything we thought we knew.
For example, in this case, there is a scientist who finds this shard thinking it is a piece of wood, and because of that, science has a completely new and truly counterintuitive theory that explains why this creature, seemingly straight out of Dr. Seuss's illustrations, is the way it is.
And for me, it has completely changed the way I see the camel.
He has transitioned from being this ridiculous creature solely adapted to a specific environment to a great traveler who has just arrived in the Sahara, and who could theoretically arrive anywhere.
Here is Azuri.
Azuri, hello, how are you?
Okay, here, I have this for you.
Azuri is on vacation; usually, he is at his concerts at Radio City Music Hall.
It's not even a joke.
In short, Azuri is here as a living proof, to remind us that the history of our world is dynamic.
Only our will can help us readjust it, reinvent it.
Isn't that right, Azuri?
And truly, we are all just a bone's length away from seeing the world differently.
Thank you very much.
