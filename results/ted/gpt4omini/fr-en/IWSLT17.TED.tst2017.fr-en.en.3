At university, I specialized in Political Science, so I had to write a lot of essays.
When an average student writes an essay, they spread out the work a bit like this.
You know... You might start off slowly, but you write a bit during the first week and, combined with more productive days, in the end, everything is done and everyone stays calm.
And I would like to do it like that.
That would be the goal. Everything would be prepared. But the essay comes, and then I do that.
And it's like that for every essay.
Then came my final year thesis of 90 pages, a document that you are supposed to work on for a year.
I knew that for such an essay, my usual pace was not viable.
So I planned everything, and I decided that I had to come up with something like that.
The year was going to unfold like that.
So I was going to start off lightly, and I was going to ramp up in the middle months, and by the end, I was going to step it up, like a little staircase.
Climbing stairs, where is the difficulty?
It's not a big deal, is it?
But then, a funny thing happened.
These first months?
They arrived and passed by, and I couldn't really work.
So we have a great revised plan.
And then... But then, those middle months arrived and I didn't really write a word, so we were here.
Then, two months turn into one month, which turns into two weeks.
And one day, I wake up with three days before the deadline, having still not written a word. So I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours, with not one, but two sleepless nights. Humans are not meant to pull two all-nighters. I raced across campus, moving in slow motion, and submitted the dissertation just before the deadline.
I thought it was the end of it all.
But a week later, I received a phone call from the university.
And they say, "Tim Urban?"
And I replied, "Yes."
"We need to talk about your thesis."
"OK."
And they say, "It's the best we've ever seen."
It's not true.
It was a very, very bad thesis.
I just wanted to enjoy that unique moment when you all thought, "This guy is fantastic!"
No, it was very, very bad.
Today, I am writing a blog.
I am writing the blog Wait But Why.
A few years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.
My behavior has always baffled the non-procrastinators around me. I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in our heads, why we are this way.
I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators are actually different from the brains of other people.
To test this, I found a lab with an MRI that allowed me to scan my brain and that of a confirmed non-procrastinator, so that I could compare them.
I brought them here to show them to you today.
I want you to look closely to identify a difference.
I know that if you are not brain experts, it is not so obvious, but try.
So here is the brain of a non-procrastinator.
Now...
Here is my brain.
There is a difference.
Both brains have a Rational Decider in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.
What does this mean for the procrastinator?
This means that everything is fine until this happens.
So the Rational Decider is going to make the rational decision to do something productive. But the Monkey doesn’t like this plan, so he takes the wheel and says, "Actually, let’s read the entire Wikipedia page on the Nancy Kerrigan/Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that."
So... So we go to the fridge to see if there's anything new since the last 10 minutes.
After that, we embark on a YouTube spiral that starts with Richard Feynman videos about magnets and ends much, much later with interviews of Justin Bieber's mother.
"All of this is going to take time, so we won’t have time to work today. Sorry!"
What's happening here?
The Monkey doesn't seem like someone you want behind the wheel.
He lives entirely in the present moment.
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and is only interested in two things: ease and fun.
In the animal kingdom, it works properly.
If you are a dog and you spend your life doing only easy and fun things, you are fantastic!
For the Monkey, humans are just another animal species.
You must sleep, eat, and create a new generation. This could have worked in Prehistory.
"But if you haven't noticed, we do not live in Prehistory."
We live in an advanced civilization, and the Monkey does not know what that is.
That is why we have another person in our brain, the Rational Decider, who gives us the ability to do things that no other animal can do.
One can project oneself into the future.
One can have an overview of the situation.
One can make long-term plans.
And he wants to take all of this into account.
And he wants us to do just what makes sense, here and now.
Sometimes it makes sense to do easy and fun things, like when you have dinner, go to bed, or enjoy some well-deserved free time.
There is an overlap. Sometimes they agree.
But on other occasions, it makes much more sense to do more difficult and less enjoyable things, in the interest of the situation as a whole.
A conflict then arises.
For the procrastinator, this conflict tends to end the same way every time, leaving them to spend a lot of time in that orange zone, an easy and fun place, completely outside the Circle of Logic.
I call it the Dark Playground.
The Dark Playground is a place that you procrastinators all know very well.
It's the place where we engage in leisure activities at times when they shouldn't be happening.
The fun you have in the Dark Playground is actually not fun, as it is unearned and the air is filled with guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-loathing, all those feelings of a good procrastinator.
In this situation, with the Monkey at the wheel, the question is: how can the procrastinator get here to the blue zone, a less enjoyable place, but where the truly important things are done?
It turns out that the procrastinator has a guardian angel. Someone who watches over him in his worst moments. Someone called the Panic Monster.
The Panic Monster sleeps most of the time, but it wakes up suddenly whenever a deadline approaches too closely or there is a risk of public embarrassment, a career disaster, or any other terrible consequence.
And the most important thing is that it’s the only thing the Monkey is afraid of.
It became very relevant in my life very recently when the people from TED contacted me six months ago and invited me to give a presentation.
Of course, I said yes.
It has always been my dream to have given a presentation for TED.
But amidst this excitement, the Rational Decider seemed to have something else in mind.
He said, "Do you fully understand what you have agreed to?"
Do you understand what is going to happen now?
"We need to sit down and work on this now."
And the Monkey said, "Absolutely, but let's open Google Earth and look at the south of India, like 50 meters above the ground, and scroll the map for 2 hours and 30 minutes until we reach the north of the country, in order to better understand India."
That's what we did that day.
As six months turn into four, then two, and then one month, the people from TED decided to publish the names of the speakers.
I opened the website and saw my face looking back at me.
And guess who woke up?
The Panic Monster starts to lose its mind, and a few seconds later, it's complete chaos throughout the system.
And the Monkey, remember, he is terrified of the Panic Monster Boom, there he is at the top of the tree!
And finally, the Rational Decider can take the wheel and I can start working on the presentation.
The Panic Monster explains a lot of the rather insane behavior of the procrastinator, such as how someone like me can spend two weeks unable to start a sentence of an essay and miraculously find the incredible work ethic to stay awake all night to write 8 pages.
All this situation, with these three characters, is the procrastinator's system.
It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.
This is what I decided to write about on the blog a few years ago.
When I did it, I was amazed by the responses.
Thousands of emails arrived from all over the world, from all kinds of people doing all sorts of things.
There were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and many, many graduate students.
They all wrote to say the same thing: "I have this problem too."
But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the article and the heavy tone of those emails.
These people wrote with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives, about what the Monkey had done to them.
I reflected on this and said: if the procrastinator's system works, where is the problem?
Why do these people feel so bad?
Apparently, there are two types of procrastination.
The examples I gave today all have a deadline.
If there is a deadline, the effects of procrastination are contained in the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved.
But there is a second type that occurs in situations without a deadline.
If you want a career as a freelancer, something in the arts or entrepreneurship, at the beginning, there is no deadline for these things because nothing happens until you start the hard work to gain momentum for things to move forward. A lot of important things.
Outside of your career, there are no deadlines, such as your family, your health, exercising, working on your romantic relationship, or getting out of it when it’s not working.
If the only mechanism the procrastinator has to tackle difficult tasks is the Panic Monster, that’s a problem because in all those situations without a deadline, it’s not there; it has no reason to wake up. The effects of procrastination are not contained and spread infinitely.
It is this type of long-term procrastination that is much less visible and discussed far less than the more entertaining, short-term procrastination based on deadlines.
We often suffer in silence and in private.
It can be a source of a tremendous amount of pain and regret.
That is why these people were sending me those emails and why they felt so bad.
It's not that they were cramming for certain projects.
Long-term procrastination has sometimes turned them into spectators of their own lives.
The frustration is not that they cannot achieve their dreams; it is that they cannot even take the first step.
So I read these emails and had a sort of epiphany: I don't think non-procrastinators exist.
It's true. I think you are all procrastinators.
You may not all be in a mess like some of us... and some here may have a healthy relationship with deadlines. But remember: the biggest trap of the Monkey occurs when deadlines do not exist.
I want to show you one last thing.
I call it the Life Calendar.
A box for each week for a 90-year life.
That doesn't represent that many boxes, especially when you've already used quite a few.
I think we should all take a close look at this calendar.
We need to think about the subjects on which we procrastinate because everyone procrastinates on something in their life.
We need to remain aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey.
It is a task for each of us.
There aren't that many boxes, so it's a task that should probably start today.
In fact, maybe not today...
You know...
Soon.
Thank you.
