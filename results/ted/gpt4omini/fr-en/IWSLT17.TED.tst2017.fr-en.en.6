Sometimes, I feel ashamed to be a European.
Last year, over a million people in need of our help arrived in Europe, and our response was frankly pathetic.
There are so many contradictions.
We mourn the tragic death of Alan Kurdi, a two-year-old child, and yet, since then, over 200 children have drowned in the Mediterranean.
International treaties recognize that refugees are a collective responsibility, and yet we accept that small Lebanon is hosting more Syrians than all of Europe combined.
We lament the existence of smugglers, yet we make it the only viable route to seek asylum in Europe.
We are lacking labor, yet we prevent people who match our economic and demographic needs from coming to Europe.
We proclaim our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist Islam, yet -- we have repressive policies that detain minor asylum seekers, separate children from their families, and confiscate the belongings of refugees.
What are we doing?
How did we end up here, adopting such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis?
I do not believe that this is due to a lack of interest, at least I do not want to believe it.
I believe it is because our politicians lack vision, that they do not know how to adapt the international asylum rules, created more than 50 years ago, to globalization.
I want to take a step back and ask two fundamental questions, the two questions that we all must ask.
First, why is the current system not working?
Secondly, how can we remedy this?
The current regime for refugees was established in response to the consequences of the Second World War by these people.
Its primary aim is to ensure that when a state fails, or worse, turns against its people, individuals have a place to go, to live in safety and with dignity until they can return.
It was created specifically for situations such as the current situation in Syria.
Through an international convention signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and an international organization, the UNHCR, states have committed to mutually admitting individuals fleeing conflict and persecution onto their territory.
But today, this system is failing.
In theory, refugees have the right to apply for asylum.
In practice, our immigration policies block the path to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to integration or to return to their country of origin.
But in practice, they remain stuck in eternal limbo.
In theory, refugees are a global common responsibility.
In practice, geography means that countries close to the conflict host the overwhelming majority of refugees.
The system is not broken because the rules are bad.
but because we do not apply them adequately to a changing world, and that is what we must reconsider.
I will explain to you how the current system works.
How does the current regime for refugees work?
But not from an institutional perspective, rather from the point of view of a refugee.
Imagine a Syrian woman. Let's call her Amira.
For me, Amira represents
many people I have met in the region.
Amira, like 25% of refugees worldwide, is a woman with children, and she cannot return home because she comes from that city you see: Homs. A city that was beautiful and historic and is now in ruins.
Amira cannot go back there.
But Amira has no hope of settling in a third country, because there is a lottery available to only less than 1% of refugees.
Amira and her family are facing an impossible choice.
They have three options.
The first option is for Amira to take her family to a camp.
In the camp, she could receive help, but there is little future for Amira and her family.
The camps are in austere and arid places, often in the desert.
In the Zaatari camp in Jordan, at night, you can hear the bombings from the other side of the border.
Economic activity is restricted.
Education is often of poor quality.
Around 80% of refugees in camps worldwide must remain there for at least 5 years.
It is a miserable life, and that is probably why, in reality, only 9% of Syrians choose this option.
An alternative for Amira is to head towards the urban area of a neighboring country, such as Amman or Beirut.
It is an option chosen by approximately 75% of Syrian refugees.
But it also involves difficulties.
Refugees in such urban areas often do not have the right to work.
They often do not have access to assistance.
And so when Amira and her family have spent all their savings, they will have nothing left and will be in urban poverty.
There is a third option that an increasing number of Syrians are choosing.
Amira can seek hope for her family by risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey to another country, and this is what we are witnessing today in Europe.
We are therefore offering refugees an almost impossible choice between three options: encampment, urban poverty, or a dangerous journey.
For refugees, this choice is the refugee regime of today.
But I believe it is a false choice.
We can reconsider this choice.
The reason we limit these options is because we think they are the only possible options for refugees, but that is not the case.
Policymakers see this as a zero-sum problem; if we benefit the refugees, citizens pay the price.
We tend to think of refugees as an inevitable cost or a burden on society.
But they donâ€™t have to be. They can contribute.
What I mean is that there are ways to increase opportunities that benefit everyone: the host countries and communities, our societies, and the refugees.
And I want to suggest four ways to transform our view of refugees.
These four perspectives have one thing in common: they incorporate the opportunities of globalization, mobility, and markets, and modernize our way of thinking about the refugee issue.
The first idea is that of favorable environments. It begins with the fundamental recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but with extraordinary circumstances.
With my colleagues from Oxford, we embarked on a research project in Uganda, observing the economic life of refugees.
We chose Uganda not because it is representative of all host countries.
It is exceptional.
Unlike most host countries, Uganda has provided economic opportunities for refugees.
It grants them the right to work and the freedom of movement.
And the results are extraordinary, for the refugees and for the host community.
In the capital, Kampala, we discovered that 21% of refugees own a business employing people, and 40% of these employees are natives of the host country.
In other words, refugees create jobs for the citizens of the host country.
Even in the camps, we discovered extraordinary examples of dynamic and thriving businesses.
For example, in a village named Nakivale, we have the example of Congolese refugees running digital music sharing businesses.
We found a Rwandan who runs a business to allow young people to play video games on recycled consoles and televisions.
Despite the challenges of extreme constraints, refugees are innovating, and the man you see is a Congolese named Demou-Kay.
Demou-Kay arrived at the camp with very few belongings, but he wanted to become a filmmaker.
So, with friends and colleagues, he launched a community radio station, rented a camera, and makes films.
He has made two documentaries with and for our team, and he is in the process of creating a successful business with almost nothing.
These are the kinds of examples that should guide our response to refugees.
Rather than seeing refugees as inevitably dependent on humanitarian aid, we must provide them with the opportunity for human development.
Yes, clothing, blankets, shelter, and food are very important in the emergency phase, but we must go further.
We must provide the opportunity for connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, and access to banks.
Everything we take for granted, which integrates us into the global economy, can and should be offered to refugees.
The second idea I want to discuss is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world have the approach that Uganda does.
Most host countries do not open their economies to refugees in this way.
But there are still pragmatic options that we can utilize.
In April last year, I went to Jordan with my colleague, development economist Paul Collier, and we reflected on an idea we had there with the international community and the government, an idea to create jobs for Syrians while supporting Jordan's national development strategy.
It is the idea of an economic zone where we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees as well as the employment of the natives of the host country.
Fifteen minutes from the Zaatari camp, which hosts 83,000 refugees, is the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Zone.
The government spent over 100 million dollars to connect it to the electrical grid and the road network, but two things were missing: access to labor and foreign investments.
so that refugees can work there instead of being stuck in camps, support their families, and develop skills through vocational training before returning to Syria.
We recognized that Jordan would benefit from this, as its development strategy requires making the leap from a middle-income country to an industrialized nation.
Refugees would benefit from this, but it would also contribute to the reconstruction of Syria after the war, recognizing that we must nurture the refugees as they are the best resource for rebuilding Syria.
We published this idea in Foreign Affairs.
King Abdullah has taken up the idea.
This was announced at the London Conference on Syria, and a trial will begin during the summer.
The third idea I want to present to you is the notion of preference between states and refugees leading to positive outcomes, as you can see in this selfie featuring Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee.
We rarely ask refugees what they want, where they want to go, but we can do so, and it will be better for everyone.
The economist Alvin Roth developed the idea of market matching, where the preference order of the parties determines their potential match.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym have explored ways to apply this idea to refugees, asking refugees to rank destinations while also allowing states to rank the types of refugees desired based on skills or languages, and then matching them accordingly.
Of course, quotas should be established regarding diversity and vulnerability, but this is a way to increase the chances of matching.
The idea of matching is successfully used, for example, to allocate students at universities, match kidney donors with patients, and the algorithm exists on dating sites.
Why not apply this to give refugees a choice?
This could also be used at the national level, where one of the biggest challenges is to persuade local communities to accept refugees.
Currently, in my country, for example, we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the city, which makes no sense.
Market matching allows for the alignment of these preferences and listens to the needs and demands of the host population and the refugees.
The fourth idea I want to discuss is the principle of humanitarian visas.
The tragedies and upheavals observed in Europe could have been avoided.
They stem from a fundamental contradiction in European asylum policy: in order to apply for asylum in Europe, you must arrive spontaneously by embarking on a dangerous journey that I have already mentioned.
But why are these journeys necessary in the age of low-cost airlines and modern consular means?
These journeys are not necessary and, last year, they led to the deaths of more than 3,000 people at the borders of Europe and on European territory.
If refugees had the right to travel directly and apply for asylum in Europe, we could avoid this. And we can do this through humanitarian visas that allow people to obtain a visa from an embassy or consulate of a neighboring country and then pay for their ferry or flight to Europe.
It costs about â‚¬1,000 to pay a smuggler from Turkey to the Greek islands.
A low-cost flight from Bodrum to Frankfurt costs â‚¬200.
If we allowed refugees, it would have major benefits.
This would save lives, reduce the smuggler market, and mark the end of the chaos observed on the European front line in areas like the Greek islands.
It is the laws that prevent us, not a rational solution.
It is an idea that has been applied.
Brazil has adopted a forward-thinking approach, and over 2,000 Syrians have obtained humanitarian visas, traveled to Brazil, and upon arrival, applied for refugee status.
In this setup, every Syrian who did this was granted refugee status and recognized as a refugee.
There is a historical precedent.
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports were used as travel documents allowing 450,000 Assyrians, Turks, and Chechens to travel to Europe and apply for refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
And the Nansen International Office for Refugees was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this viable strategy.
Each of these four ideas I have presented to you is a way to expand Amira's choices.
These are ways we have to expand the choices of refugees beyond these three impossible options I have outlined, while also benefiting others.
In conclusion, we need a new perspectiveâ€”a vision that expands the choices of refugees while recognizing that they do not have to be a burden.
There is nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost.
Yes, they are a humanitarian responsibility, but they are human beings with skills, talents, aspirations, and the ability to contribute if we allow them to.
In the new world, migration will not stop.
What we have seen in Europe will continue for years.
People will still travel, populations will be displaced, and we must find rational and realistic ways to manage it, not based on the old logics of humanitarian aid and charity, but built on the opportunities offered by globalization, markets, and mobility.
I urge you to wake up, and I urge our politicians to wake up to this challenge.
Thank you very much.
