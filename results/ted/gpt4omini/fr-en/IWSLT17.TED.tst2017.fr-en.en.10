Hello.
My name is Matthew Williams, and I am a champion.
I have won medals in three different sports and national championships in Canada, played at an international level in basketball, and I was proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I train 5 days a week in basketball and speed skating, working with high-quality coaches and mental performance consultants to be the best in my sport.
Moreover, I do all of this with the Special Olympics.
Does this change the way you perceive me and my achievements?
The world does not see people like me as champions.
Not so long ago, people like me were shunned and hidden.
The Special Olympics have evolved significantly since their inception in 1968, but too often, individuals with intellectual disabilities remain invisible to the general public.
People use the word "R" with me, and they think it's not a big deal.
It is the word "retarded" or "backward" used in a derogatory manner.
They cannot imagine how much it hurts us, me and my friends.
I don't want you to think that I'm here for a charity case.
I am here because there is still a major issue with how many people perceive individuals with intellectual disabilities, or, too often, how they do not see them at all.
Did you know that the world championships took place this year?
I was among the more than 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries competing in Los Angeles.
There were over 62,000 spectators at the opening ceremonies, and TSN and ESPN were there to cover the event.
Did you know that this event took place?
What do you think when you meet someone like me?
I am here today to challenge you to see us as equals.
The Special Olympics transform the very identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perception of anyone watching the competition.
For those of you who do not know, the Special Olympics are for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
The Special Olympics are separate from the Paralympic and Olympic Games.
We offer high-quality sports programs year-round for individuals with intellectual disabilities, which changes lives and perceptions.
This movement has changed my life and that of so many other people.
And it has changed the way the world sees individuals with intellectual disabilities.
I was born epileptic and with an intellectual disability.
Growing up, I played hockey until I was 12 years old.
The older I got, the more I felt it was harder to keep up with others, and I was angry and frustrated.
For a while, I didn't participate in any sports, had no friends, and felt forgotten and sad.
There was a time when individuals with intellectual disabilities were hidden from society.
No one thought they could participate in a sport, let alone be an important member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, studied the effects of regular exercise on the physical condition of children with intellectual disabilities.
Using rigorous scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers concluded that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that led to physical fitness issues.
Many people doubted that individuals with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sports competitions.
But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of the Special Olympics, persevered, and the athletes of the Special Olympics proved them right four and a half million times.
Before I joined the Special Olympics, I was nervous because I was young, shy, and had little self-confidence, and I didn't have many friends.
When I arrived, however, everyone encouraged me a lot, supported me, and let me be myself without being judged.
Now, I am a basketball player and a speed skater who competed in the regional and national games, and this year, finished at the Summer World Games in Los Angeles, where I was part of the very first Canadian basketball team to participate in the World Games.
I am one of more than four and a half million athletes worldwide, and I have heard so many similar stories.
Being an athlete in the Special Olympics restores pride and dignity.
The Special Olympics also address important health needs.
Studies have shown that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than men without, and women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years younger than women without.
The Special Olympics keep us healthy by making us active and getting us involved in a sport.
Furthermore, our coaches teach us about nutrition and health.
The Special Olympics also provide free screening tests for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor or accessing medical care.
At the 2015 Summer World Games, my teammates from Team Canada and I played against the team from Nigeria.
The day before our match, the Nigerian basketball team came for screening, and the Athletes of the World Games were provided free screenings to seven out of ten members, giving them the opportunity to hear clearly for the first time.
This change for them was incredible.
They were very excited, happy, and confident because their coaches could communicate verbally with them.
And they were very moved because they could hear the sounds of the basketball, the sounds of the whistle, and the enthusiastic fans in the stands — sounds that we take for granted.
The Special Olympics do more than transform athletes in sports.
The Special Olympics transform their lives outside of the fields.
This year, research has shown that nearly half of adults in the United States do not know a single person with an intellectual disability, and the 44% of Americans who have no personal contact with intellectual disabilities are significantly less tolerant and positive.
Then there is the word starting with "R," demonstrating that individuals with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people.
People use it as a common term or an insult.
It was tweeted more than nine million times last year, and it is deeply hurtful to me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the world.
People do not imagine that it is insulting, but it is.
As my fellow athlete and global ambassador John Franklin Stephens wrote in an open letter to a political commentator who had used the word starting with "R" as an insult, "Come join us one day at the Special Olympics."
"You will see if you leave with an unchanged heart."
This year, at the 2015 Summer World Games, people lined up for hours before diving into the final night of weightlifting competition.
That evening was packed when my teammate Jackie Barrett, the Newfoundland Moose, lifted 297 kg and 277 kg in squats — setting huge new records at the Special Olympics.
Jackie is one of the record holders among all weightlifters in Newfoundland — not just at the Special Olympics but among all weightlifters.
Jackie was a huge celebrity in Los Angeles, and ESPN tweeted live about his new record and was impressed by his performance.
Fifty years ago, few people imagined individuals with intellectual disabilities capable of doing something like that.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of the World Games and cheer on athletes from 165 countries around the world.
Far from being hidden, we were applauded and celebrated.
The Special Olympics teach athletes to be confident and proud of themselves.
The Special Olympics teach the world that individuals with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and consideration.
Now, I have dreams and successes in my sport, great coaches, respect and dignity, better health, and I am pursuing a career as a personal trainer.
I am no longer hidden, mocked, and I am here giving a TED talk.
The world is a different place thanks to the Special Olympics, but there is still work to be done.
So the next time you see someone with intellectual disabilities, I hope you see their talent.
The next time someone uses the word starting with "R" next to you, I hope you will tell them how hurtful it is.
I hope you will consider getting involved in the Special Olympics.
I would like to leave you with one final thought.
Nelson Mandela said, "Sport has the power to change the world."
The Special Olympics are changing the world by transforming four and a half million athletes and providing us with a place to feel confident, meet friends, not be judged, and feel and be champions.
Thank you very much.
