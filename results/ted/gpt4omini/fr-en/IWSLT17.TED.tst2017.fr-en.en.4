We were there, souls and bodies piled together in a church in Texas, on the last night of our lives.
Piled together in a room just like this one, but with old wooden benches draped in worn red fabric, an organ to my left and a choir behind me, the baptismal font embedded in the wall behind it.
A room like this one, nonetheless.
With that same overwhelming sense of suspense, the same deep hopes for salvation, the same sweat in the palms, and the same people at the back who are not listening.
It was December 31, 1999, the night of the Second Coming of Christ, and the end of the world as I knew it.
I had turned 12 that year, and I had reached the age of responsibility.
After I stopped complaining about the injustice of Jesus's return at the moment I was to be held accountable for my actions, I realized it was better for me to clean up quickly.
I went to church as often as possible.
I was watching for silence with the anxiety of someone who would be listening for noise, trying to make sure that the Lord hadn't played a trick on me and decided to return earlier.
And in case He returned earlier, I had anticipated a backup plan by reading the "Left Behind" series, which was a huge hit at the time.
I found in their pages that if I wasn't taken at midnight, I had another chance.
I just had to avoid taking the mark of the beast, to fight the demons, the plagues, and the Antichrist himself.
It would be difficult — but I knew I was capable of it.
But it was no longer the time to get organized.
It was 11:50 PM.
We had 10 minutes left, and my pastor called us to the altar because he wanted to pray when midnight struck.
Each faction of the congregation took its place.
The choir remained in the choir, the deacons and their wives — or the Baptist Bourgeoisie, as I like to call them — took their place in the front row facing the altar.
You see, in the United States, even the Second Coming of Christ has a VIP section.
And just behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie were the elderly — those men and women whose backs had once been bent under the hot sun of the cotton fields of East Texas, whose skins seemed marked with a smooth and noble brown, just like the clay of East Texas, whose hopes and dreams for the future of their lives outside of East Texas had sometimes been shattered,
deeper than their backs.
Yes, those men and women were, for me, the stars of the show.
They had waited for this moment all their lives, just as their medieval predecessors had eagerly awaited the end of the world, and as my grandmother waited for the Oprah Winfrey Show on Channel 8, every day at 4 PM.
And as she made her way to the altar, I hid behind her, for I was absolutely certain that my grandmother would go to Heaven.
And I thought that if I held her hand tightly during the prayer, it was possible that I would go with her.
So I held her hand, and I closed my eyes, to listen, to wait.
The prayers grew louder.
And the cries in response to the call to prayer rose even higher.
The organ joined the funereal atmosphere.
And the rising heat joined the sweat.
My hand tightened its grip, so as not to be the one left behind.
I closed my eyes tighter, so as not to see the separation of the wheat from the tares.
Then a voice rose above us: "Amen."
It was over.
I looked at the clock.
It was past midnight.
I looked at the older believers, whose Savior had not come, who were too proud to show their disappointment, who had believed too much and for too long to start doubting now.
But I was upset for them.
They had been fooled, deceived, misled, and I had let myself get caught up with them.
I had said their prayers, I had not given in to temptation as best as I could.
I had not dipped my head once, but twice, in those baptismal fonts that gave you a chill.
I had believed.
And now what?
I got home in time to turn on the television and watch Peter Jennings announce the new millennium as he moved around the globe.
I was struck by the oddity of the multiple returns of Jesus, based on the different time zones.
And I felt even more ridiculous—hurt, really.
But that night, I did not stop believing.
I just started to believe one new thing: that it was possible not to believe.
It was possible that the answers were wrong, that the questions themselves were wrong.
From now on, where there had once been a mountain of certainty, there rushed toward its base a spring of doubt, a spring that promised rivers.
I can trace the origin of the entire drama of my life back to that night in that church, when my Savior did not come for me; when what I truly believed turned out, if not a lie, at least not entirely the truth.
Although some prepared for the year 2000 in a very different way, I am convinced that you are here because a part of you has done the same as me since the beginning of this new century, since my mother left, my father did not return, and my Lord refused to come.
And I reached out, hoping to grasp something to believe in.
I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18, confident that my journey from Oak Cliff, Texas, was an opportunity to leave behind all the trials I had known, the broken dreams and bodies I had seen.
But when I found myself at home during winter break, face down, hands tied behind my back, and a burglar's gun to my head, I knew that even the best education could not save me.
I held on when I arrived at Lehman Brothers as an intern in 2008.
So full of hope — that I called my family to inform them that we would never be poor again.
But when I saw this temple of finance collapse before my eyes, I knew that even the best job could not save me.
I held on when I arrived in Washington as a young employee, who had heard a voice from Illinois saying, "We have waited a long time, but with this election, change has come to the United States."
But when Congress came to a standstill, the country tore itself apart, and hope and change sounded like a joke, I knew that even the political Second Coming could not save me.
I had faithfully knelt at the altar of the American Dream, praying to the gods of my time, gods of success, money, and power.
But time and again, midnight struck, and I opened my eyes to witness the death of all those gods.
From that cemetery, I began to search once more, not out of courage, but because I knew that either I believed, or I would die.
So I undertook a pilgrimage, once again to another Mecca, Harvard Business School—knowing this time that I could not simply accept the salvation it claimed to offer.
No, I knew there would be more work to do.
The work began late, in a dark corner of a crowded party, on a bleak and miserable winter night in Cambridge, when three friends and I asked ourselves what young people in search of authenticity have been asking for a long time: "What if we hit the road?"
We did not know where to go or how to get there, but we knew that we had to do it.
All our lives, we longed, as Jack Kerouac wrote, to "slip into the night and disappear somewhere," and to see what everyone was doing all across the country.
Although other voices said that the risk was too great and the evidence too thin, we still set off.
We traveled nearly 13,000 kilometers across America during the summer of 2013, through the pastures of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit, the swamps of New Orleans, where we found and worked with men and women who were creating small businesses whose intent defined their goals.
Having been trained at the western edge of capitalism, this appeared to us as a revolutionary idea.
And this idea spread, developing into a nonprofit organization, MBAs Across America, a movement that brought me here, to this stage, today.
This idea developed because we discovered that our generation is hungry for purpose, for meaning,
for we found countless entrepreneurs in every corner of America, who were creating jobs, changing lives, and who needed a little help.
But if I'm honest, it also developed because I fought for it.
I spared no effort in preaching this gospel, to bring more people to believe that we could heal the wounds of a broken country, one social venture at a time.
But it was this gospel journey that led me to this rather different gospel that I have come to share with you today.
This journey began one evening, nearly a year ago, at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, during a gala for alumni of Harvard Business School.
Under a life-size replica of a whale, I sat with the titans of our time as they celebrated their peers and their good deeds.
There was pride in a room where the value and net assets under management exceeded 500 billion dollars.
We reviewed everything we had done, and it was good.
But by chance, two days later, I had to go not far from there, to Harlem. I found myself sitting in an urban farm that had once been a vacant lot, listening to a man named Tony talk to me about the children who came here every day.
They all lived below the poverty line.
Many of them carried their belongings in a backpack to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter.
Some of them participated in Tony's program, called Harlem Grown, to receive their only meal of the day.
Tony told me that he started Harlem Grown with his retirement money, after 20 years as a taxi driver.
He told me that he didn't take a salary because, despite his success, the program struggled to secure resources.
He told me that he would accept any help he could get.
And I was there to help.
When I left Tony, I felt the sting and salt of tears welling up in my eyes.
I felt the weight of the revelation that I could sit in one room, one evening, where a few hundred people had 500 billion dollars, and in another room, just two days later, barely 5 kilometers away, where a man lived without a salary so that a child could have their only meal of the day.
It wasn't the glaring inequality that made me want to cry. It wasn't the thought of those hungry, homeless children, it wasn't the rage towards the 1% or the pity for the 99%.
No, I was troubled because I had finally realized that I was the dialysis of a country that needed a kidney transplant.
I realized that my story replaced all those of those expected to take charge of themselves, even if they had nothing to grasp onto to do so; that my organization replaced all the structural, systemic aid that never reached Harlem, or Appalachia, or the basement level; that my voice replaced all those voices that seemed too ignorant, too proletarian, too ill-suited.
And that shame, that shame overwhelmed me, like the shame of sitting in front of the television watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium, again, and again, and again.
I had been duped, deceived, taken in.
But this time, the false Savior was me.
You see, I have come a long way since the altar, the night I believed the world was going to end, from a world where people spoke in tongues, regarded suffering as a necessary act of God, and took a text as an infallible truth.
Yes, I have come so far that I find myself exactly where I started.
Because it is simply false to say that we live in an era of disbelief — no, we believe today just as much as before.
Some of us may believe in the prophecy of Brené Brown or Tony Robbins.
We can believe in the Bible of the New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review.
We can believe deeply when we worship here at the TED church, but we desperately want to believe, we need to believe.
We speak the language of charismatic leaders who promise to solve all our problems.
We see suffering as a necessary act of capitalism, our god. We take the text of technological progress as the infallible truth.
And we barely realize the human cost we pay when we fail to question a brick, for fear that it will destroy all our foundations.
But if you are troubled by the unacceptable things we have come to accept, then it must be time for a reckoning.
I have no gospel of disruption or innovation, nor a triple bottom line.
In fact, I have no gospel of faith to share with you today.
I have, and I offer, a gospel of doubt.
The gospel of doubt does not ask you to stop believing, but to believe in something new: that it is possible not to believe.
It is possible that the answers are wrong, that the questions themselves are wrong.
Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we, on this stage, in this room, are wrong.
Because it raises the question: "Why?"
With all the power we hold in our hands, why do people still suffer so much?
This doubt leads me to share that we are placing my organization, MBAs Across America, into suspension.
We have laid off our team and closed our doors, and we will share our model freely with anyone who grasps the power to do this work without waiting for our permission.
This doubt compels me to relinquish the role of savior that some expect of me, because there is not enough time and our chances are too slim to wait for second comings, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here.
And this doubt, it regenerates me, it gives me hope, that when our problems overwhelm us, when the paths laid out for us seem to lead us to our demise, when our healers bring no relief to our wounds, it will not be our blind faith — no, it will be our humble doubt that will illuminate a little of the darkness in our lives and in our world, and allow us to make our voices heard to whisper,
or to shout, or to simply say, very simply: "There must be another way."
Thank you.
