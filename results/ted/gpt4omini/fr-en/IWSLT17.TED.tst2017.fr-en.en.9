By a show of hands: how many of you have ever unfriended someone on Facebook because they made an offensive comment about politics, religion, parenting, or food?
How many of you avoid at least one person just so you don't have to talk to them?
Previously, to have a polite conversation, we followed the advice of Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady": stick to the weather and your health.
But nowadays, with climate change and the anti-vaccination movement, these topics... are no longer very safe.
The world we live in, this world where any conversation can potentially turn into a controversy, where our politicians cannot speak to each other, and where even the most trivial subjects have supporters and detractors, this world is not normal.
Pew Research conducted a study on 10,000 American adults and found that, currently, we are more polarized, more divided, than ever before.
We make fewer compromises, which means that we do not listen to each other.
We decide where to live, whom to marry, and even who our friends will be, based on our already established beliefs.
Once again, that does not mean that we do not listen to each other.
A conversation requires a balance between speaking and listening, and somewhere along the way, we have lost that balance.
This is partly due to technology.
The cell phones that you all have, either in your hands or close enough to grab quickly.
According to Pew Research, about one-third of American teenagers send more than 100 text messages per day.
Many of them, in fact the majority, will likely send a text message to their friends rather than talk to them face to face.
There is a great article in the magazine "The Atlantic."
written by Paul Barnwell, a high school teacher.
His students did a communication project.
He wanted to teach them to talk about a specific subject without notes.
He said this: "I realized..."
"I realized that the ability to hold a conversation is perhaps the skill that is most often overlooked in teaching."
Children spend hours dialoguing and sharing ideas through screens, but they rarely have the opportunity to refine their interpersonal communication skills.
It may seem strange, but we must ask ourselves: in the 21st century, what skill is more important than knowing how to hold a coherent conversation?
"My job is to talk to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers."
I talk to people I like and to others I don't like.
I talk to people with whom I profoundly disagree.
"But I always have fantastic conversations with them."
For the next 10 minutes, I would like to teach you how to speak and listen.
Many of you have already heard advice on this subject: looking people in the eye, thinking ahead about interesting topics to discuss, watching, nodding, and smiling to show your attention, repeating what you have heard or summarizing it.
Forget all of that.
"It's crap."
There is no reason to learn to demonstrate that you are attentive if you are actually attentive.
"I use exactly the same skills as a professional interviewer that I do in my daily life."
I am going to teach you how to question people, and this will help you learn how to be better communicators.
Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time, without getting bored, and above all, without offending anyone.
"We have all had extraordinary conversations."
"We have had them. We know what it's like."
The kind of conversation that makes you feel engaged and inspired, or that gives you the impression of having truly created a connection, or of having been perfectly understood.
There is no reason why the majority of our conversations cannot be like that.
I have 10 basic rules. I will explain them to you, but honestly, if you take just one and master it fully, you will already have better conversations.
Number 1: no multitasking.
Not just putting down your phone, tablet, or car keys, or whatever you have in your hand.
Be present.
Live in the moment.
Don't think about the argument with your boss,
nor about what you are going to eat tonight.
If you want to end the conversation, go ahead, but don't be only half present.
Number 2: don't give lessons.
If you want to give your opinion, without any opportunity to respond, discuss, react, or grow, write a blog.
I have a very good reason not to invite critics to my show: they are very boring.
Conservatives will hate Obama, food stamps, and abortion.
Liberals will hate the big banks, the oil industry, and Dick Cheney.
"Completely predictable."
You don't want to be like that.
You should start every conversation with the idea that you are going to learn something.
Scott Peck, the famous therapist, said that for true listening, one must step back.
That sometimes means putting aside your own opinion.
He said that the speaker will feel this acceptance, and will become less and less vulnerable, more likely to offer the hidden corners of their mind to the listener.
Consider that you have things to learn.
Bill Nye: "Every person knows something that you don't."
I put it this way: every person is an expert in something.
Number 3: Ask open-ended questions.
For that, take inspiration from journalists.
Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why, or how.
If you ask a complex question, the answer will be simple.
If I ask you, "Were you terrified?"
you will respond to the most powerful word in this sentence, here "terrified," and the answer will be either yes or no.
"Were you angry?" "Yes, very angry."
Let them describe. They are the ones who know.
Ask questions such as: "What was it like?"
"What did you feel?"
For they might need a moment to reflect, and you will then have a much more interesting response.
Number 4: go with the flow.
That means that ideas will come to your mind, and you need to let them out of your mind.
We have often heard interviews where the guest speaks for several minutes, then the host takes over and asks a question that seems to come out of nowhere, or to which an answer has already been given.
The host probably stopped listening 2 minutes earlier because he was thinking about his next question, a very clever question he was determined to ask.
We do the same thing.
We are sitting, talking with someone, and then we remember our meeting with Hugh Jackman in a café.
We stop listening.
Stories and ideas will come to you.
You need to let them come and then go.
Number 5: if you don't know, say that you don't know.
People on the radio, particularly on NPR, are more aware that what they say is being recorded; therefore, they are more cautious when discussing their expertise and what they are sure they know.
Do the same. Err on the side of caution.
Words should not be taken lightly.
Number 6: Do not compare your experience to theirs.
If they talk about the loss of a family member, do not talk about the loss of a family member of your own.
If they talk about the problems they have at work, do not tell them that you hate your job.
It is not the same thing, ever.
Every experience is unique.
More importantly, it is not about you.
No need to use this moment to prove how great you are or how much you have suffered.
Someone asked Stephen Hawking about his IQ, to which he replied: "No idea. Those who boast about their IQ are losers."
Conversations are not promotional opportunities.
Number 7: try not to repeat yourself.
It's condescending and very boring, and we tend to do it.
Particularly during conversations at work, or with our children, we have a message to convey, so we keep rephrasing it tirelessly.
Don't do it.
Number 8: Spare the details.
Frankly, it doesn't matter the years, the names, the dates, and all those details that you can't remember.
It doesn't matter. What matters is you.
People are interested in you, in what you have in common.
Forget the details. Set them aside.
Number 9: it’s not the last one, but it’s the most important.
Listen.
I cannot tell you how many important people have said that listening may be the most important skill to develop.
Buddha said, and I paraphrase: "If your mouth is open, you are not learning."
And Calvin Coolidge said, "No one was ever fired for listening."
Why do we not listen to each other?
First, we prefer to talk.
When I speak, I have control.
I don't have to hear what doesn't interest me.
I am the center of attention.
I can highlight my identity.
But that's not all: we allow ourselves to be distracted.
We speak on average 225 words per minute, but can listen to up to 500.
So our minds fill in with an additional 275 words.
I know that it takes effort and energy to give someone your attention, but if you don't do that, it's not a conversation.
but rather two people shouting barely related phrases in the same space.
You must listen to each other.
Stephen Covey said it very well:
"Many of us do not listen to understand."
"We listen to respond."
One last rule, number 10: be brief.
"A good conversation is like a miniskirt: short enough to hold attention, and long enough to cover the subject. -- My sister" It all comes down to a basic concept: be interested in others.
I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there was a ritual in my home.
People would come to talk to my grandparents, and after they left, my mother would come to us and say, "Do you know who that was?"
She was the runner-up for Miss America.
He was the mayor of Sacramento.
She won a Pulitzer Prize. He is a Russian ballet dancer.
I grew up believing that everyone has a hidden and truly wonderful side.
I believe that makes me a better facilitator.
I keep my mouth shut as much as possible, I keep an open mind, and I am always ready to be amazed, and I am never disappointed.
Do the same.
Go talk to people, listen to them, and, above all, be ready to be amazed.
Thank you.
