I come from one of the most liberal, tolerant, and progressive places in the United States: Seattle, in the state of Washington.
I grew up with a family of great Seattleites.
My mother was an artist, my father a university professor, and I am grateful for my childhood, as I have always been completely comfortable living my life as I saw fit.
In fact, I took a path that was not the one my parents had envisioned.
At 19, I dropped out of university -- dropped out, kicked out, splitting hairs.
I went on tour as a professional horn player, which had always been my dream.
I played chamber music across the United States and Europe, and I spent 2 years on tour with a great jazz player: Charlie Bird.
As I approached my 30s, I ended up becoming a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra.
What a life!
My parents never complained.
They supported me all the way.
It was not their dream.
They told their neighbors and friends: "Our son is taking a sabbatical decade."
And -- There was, however, an awkward conversation about my lifestyle that I would like to discuss with you.
I was 27 years old, I had returned from Barcelona, I was at my parents' house for Christmas, I was preparing dinner with my mother and we were alone in the kitchen.
And she was silent, too silent.
Something was wrong.
I said, "Mom, what are you thinking about?"
She said, "Your father and I are worried about you."
I said, "What?" What could it be?
And she said, "I want you to be completely honest: did you vote Republican?"
In fact, I wasn't very political; I was just a horn player.
I had an epiphany; they had sensed it, and it was causing confusion.
I had become an enthusiast of capitalism, and I want to explain to you what it is.
This stemmed from the interest I have always had in, believe it or not, poverty.
When I was a child, growing up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw real poverty.
We were a lower middle-class family, but of course, that is not real poverty.
It's far from that.
The first time I saw poverty and its face, I was 6 or 7 years old, in the early 1970s.
And, as for many of you, it was a prosaic and mundane example.
It was a photograph in National Geographic of a child my age in East Africa, with flies on his face and a distended belly.
He wasn't going to make it; I knew it, and I felt helpless.
Some of you may remember that image, not exactly this one, but a similar one.
She revealed the stark misery to the West.
This vision haunted me as I grew up, went to school, dropped out, did other things, and started a family.
And I wondered what had happened to that child.
or to others like him around the world.
I studied, even though I wasn't at university; I was searching for an answer: what happened to the poorest people in the world?
Was it getting worse, getting better? What?
I found the answer, and it changed my life, and I want to share it with you.
Look -- most Americans believe that poverty has worsened since our childhood since they saw that photo.
Ask Americans how poverty in the world has evolved, and 70% will say that world hunger has worsened since the early 1970s.
But here is the truth.
Here is the epiphany that changed my way of thinking.
Between the 1970s and today, the percentage of the global population living in famine, living on less than one dollar a day, adjusted for inflation, has decreased by 80%.
There has been an 80% decrease in the most severe global poverty since my childhood.
And I didn't even know it.
This, my friends, is a miracle.
We must celebrate it.
It is the greatest anti-poverty achievement in the history of humanity, and it is happening in our lifetime.
When I learned this, I asked: what made this happen, made this possible?
For if you do not know why, you cannot do it again.
If you want to do it again and lift the next two billion out of poverty, because that is what we are talking about: since my childhood, two billion of them, our brothers and sisters, have been lifted out of poverty.
I want the next two billion, so I need to know why.
I sought an answer.
She wasn't political, because I didn't care.
I still don't care.
I wanted the best answer from traditional economists on the left, right, and center.
Here it is.
Here are the reasons.
These are the five reasons why two billion of our brothers and sisters have been lifted out of poverty since my childhood.
The first: globalization.
The second: free trade.
The third: property rights.
The fourth: the rule of law.
The fifth: entrepreneurship.
It is the system of free enterprise spreading across the world after 1970 that has made this happen.
I am not naive.
I know that free enterprise is not perfect and that free enterprise alone is not enough to build a better world.
But it is brilliant.
And it transcends politics.
Here is what I have learned, my epiphany.
Capitalism is not just a matter of accumulation.
Its main asset is aspiration, which is what many people talk about on this stage, the aspiration that comes from dreams embedded in the system of free enterprise.
We must share it with more people.
I want to talk to you about a second epiphany that is related to the first and that can lead us to progress, not only in the world but also within ourselves.
The best quote I have heard to summarize the thoughts I just mentioned about lifting people out of poverty is this: "Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history."
They have lifted billions of people out of poverty.
Who said that?
It sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
It is false.
President Barack Obama said it.
Why do I know it by heart?
For he was addressing me.
It's crazy.
And I said, "Hallelujah!"
But more than that, I said, "What an opportunity."
Do you know what I was thinking about?
I was at an event organized on this topic at Georgetown University in May 2015.
And I thought that it was the solution to America's biggest problem today. What is it?
It is about coming together around these ideas, both liberal and conservative, to help those who need it most.
No need to tell you that we are in crisis, in America and in many politically polarized countries around the world.
It has reached a critical level of crisis.
It is unpleasant. It is not fair.
Last year, there was an article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the West.
It was an article from 2014 on the asymmetry of political motivations.
What is it? Psychologists call this the presumption phenomenon that your ideology is based on love while your opponent's ideology is based on hate.
It is common in a global conflict.
You would expect to see it, for example, between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the authors of this article have discovered is that today in America, a majority of Republicans and Democrats suffer from asymmetry of political motivations.
Today, a majority of politically active people believe they are motivated by love while the other party is motivated by hate.
Think about it. Think about it.
Most people say, "My ideology is based on a fundamental goodwill; I want to help people, but others are demonic and wish me harm."
Society cannot progress when there is this type of asymmetry.
It is impossible.
How can this be resolved?
First, let's be honest: there are differences.
Let's not minimize the differences. That would be na√Øve.
There is a lot of research on this topic.
A veteran of the TED stage is my friend Jonathan Haidt.
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
He works on the ideology, values, and morals of different people to see their differences.
He showed us, for example, that conservatives and liberals place different emphasis on what they find important.
For example, Jon Haidt has shown that liberals care about poverty 59% more than about economic freedom.
And conservatives care about economic freedom 28% more than about poverty.
Irreconcilable differences?
We will never come together. False.
It is in diversity that our strength lies.
Remember what has lifted us out of poverty.
It was an obsession with poverty accompanied by the method of economic freedom spreading throughout the world.
We need others; in other words, if we want to help people and lift the next two billion out of poverty.
There is no other solution.
How are we going to do this?
It's delicate.
We must innovate in our way of thinking.
Many points are on stage.
Social entrepreneurship. Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal.
We need to invest abroad in a sustainable, responsible, ethical, and moral way. Yes. Yes.
But what do we really need?
Of a flexible ideology,
less predictable.
No?
Don't you ever feel that your ideology is becoming predictable?
Almost conventional?
Don't you feel like you're always listening to people who agree with you?
Why is it dangerous?
For when we talk about the economy in this country, on the right, conservatives always talk about taxes, regulations, and big government.
And on the left, liberals always talk about income inequality.
These are important things, very important for me and for you.
But when it comes to helping people who are starving and need us, these are distractions.
We must come together around the best ways to alleviate poverty by using the best tools at our disposal; this only happens when conservatives acknowledge their need for liberals and their obsession with poverty, and liberals recognize their need for conservatives and their obsession with the free market.
It is in this diversity that the future strength of this country lies, if we choose it.
How are we going to do this? How are we going to do this together?
I need a plan of action, not just for you but for me.
Number one. First point: it is not enough to tolerate people who disagree.
It is not enough.
Let us remember that we need people who disagree, for there are those who need all of us, who are still waiting for these tools.
What are you going to do? How are you going to express it?
Where does it start? It starts here.
In this room, we are all fortunate.
Fortunate to have people who listen to us.
Fortunate to thrive. Fortunate to lead.
When people hear us, with the unpredictable ideology, they may listen to us.
Progress may begin there.
It is the first point. The second.
Second: I ask you and I ask myself to be specifically the person who blurs the boundary, who is ambiguous, difficult to categorize.
If you are a conservative, be a conservative who always speaks about poverty and the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor.
If you are a liberal, be a liberal who always speaks about the beauty of free markets, used responsibly, to solve our problems.
If we do this, we achieve two things.
One: we begin to work for the next billions and to be the solution that we have seen in the past and that we need in the future. We achieve this.
And the second thing is that we could be able to take the terrible sacred ideological war that we are suffering from in this country and transform it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
And then perhaps, perhaps, we will realize that our great differences are ultimately not so great.
Thank you.
