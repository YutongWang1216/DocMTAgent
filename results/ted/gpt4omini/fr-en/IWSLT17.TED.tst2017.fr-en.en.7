When I was little, I dreamed of the ocean.
A wild place, very colorful and full of life, housing strange and fantastic creatures.
I imagined big sharks reigning supreme and graceful sea turtles swirling through the corals.
First a marine biologist, then a photographer, I spent most of my career seeking places as magical as those I dreamed of as a child.
As you can see, I started exploring the water very early on.
But the first time I really went underwater, I was about 10 years old.
I clearly remember kicking my fins determinedly to reach that old cannon embedded in a shallow coral reef.
When I finally managed to catch it, I looked up and found myself surrounded by fish of every color of the rainbow.
That day, I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Peschak Marine Conservation Photographer In my 40 years on Earth, I have had the immense privilege of exploring some of the most incredible marine landscapes for National Geographic and the Save Our Seas Foundation.
I photographed everything, from enormous sharks to tiny ones that fit in the palm of my hand.
I felt the fish in the breath of the humpback whales feeding beside me in the cold waters of Canada, near the Great Bear Rainforest.
I even learned all about the courtship rituals of the green turtle in the Mozambique Channel.
We all leave a mark on the ocean and vice versa.
And the pristine seas I dreamed of as a child are still becoming harder to find.
They are always smaller and more threatened.
While we, humans, maintain our role as the planet's greatest predator, I have witnessed direct repercussions and photographed them.
I long believed I had to shock my audience with disturbing images to jolt them out of their indifference.
This approach has its merits, but I have moved away from it.
In my opinion, the best way to bring about change is to sell love.
If you want, I am a matchmaker, and as a photographer, I have the exceptional opportunity to reveal entire animals and ecosystems that lie beneath the surface of the ocean.
One cannot love and fight for something if one ignores its existence.
Revealing this â€“ it is the entire power of marine photography.
Among the hundreds of underwater locations I have seen, a handful of these landscapes has profoundly touched me.
I saw the first of these landscapes about 10 years ago, off the wild and rugged coast of South Africa.
Every summer, huge schools of sardines move north, a mass migration phenomenon known as the Sardine Run.
A wild race of these fish
where hungry and agile hordes of predators chase them.
Common dolphins hunt together and manage to isolate sardines from the main school, creating small schools.
They dive and herd the fish upwards, against the surface, and rush to enjoy their wriggling feast.
The sharks follow closely.
For many people, sharks and dolphins are sworn enemies, but during the Sardine Run, they coexist.
In fact, dolphins help sharks to feed more efficiently.
Without the dolphins, the small schools created are more sparse, and the sharks often end up with a "sardine doughnut" or a mouthful of water.
I had some lively moments with the sharks during the Sardine Run, but I know they don't see me as prey.
I receive blows and am jostled like all the other participants in this brawling banquet.
Let's leave the African coasts and head east, across the vastness of the Indian Ocean to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands.
During the monsoon season, manta rays from across the archipelago make their way to a tiny islet in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.
Armies of crustaceans, most smaller than a marble, are the staple food of manta rays.
When plankton concentrations are low, manta rays feed alone and perform backward somersaults, looping like a puppy chasing its tail.
When the density of plankton increases, the rays line up in single file and form these long chains. Every delicious morsel that escapes the first is gobbled up by the second or the next one.
When the concentration of plankton reaches its peak, manta rays swim ever closer in a rotating movement through which they feed.
As they swirl in this tight formation, the column of manta rays creates its own vortex, sucking in and bringing plankton right into the cavernous mouths of the rays.
The experience of diving among these countless rays is absolutely unforgettable.
The first time I photographed Hanifaru, the site was unprotected and threatened by development.
I have worked with NGOs such as Manta Trust, and my photos have helped make Hanifaru a marine protected area.
Fishermen from the neighboring islands hunted these manta rays, using their skin to make traditional drums.
Today, they are the most fervent conservationists, and manta rays contribute over 8 million dollars to the Maldivian economy each year.
I have always wanted to travel back in time and see an era when maps were incomplete or indicated: "Here be dragons."
I came closest to it by visiting these remote atolls in the heart of the Indian Ocean.
Far, far away from the lines of boats and fishing, diving in these waters is a poignant reminder of what our oceans once looked like.
Bassas da India is largely unknown. It is a tiny coral spot in the Mozambique Channel.
Its barrier forms a shield that protects its inner lagoon, a nursery for Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are anything but shy, even during the day.
Something told me they would be even bolder and more numerous at night.
I found myself facing more sharks than ever, gathered around a simple outcrop.
Photographing and sharing moments like these reminds me why I chose this path.
Not long ago, I was working on a project in Baja California for National Geographic.
Halfway down the Pacific coast lies San Ignacio Lagoon, where the gray whale comes to give birth.
For a century, this coast has been the scene of a systematic massacre, with more than 20,000 gray whales killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
Today, the descendants of these same whales play at the surface with their offspring, and they even interact with us.
This species has remarkably thrived.
On the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo, a sleepy fishing village.
Decades of overfishing have brought them to the brink of collapse.
In 1995, local fishermen convinced the authorities to make their waters a marine reserve.
But what happened next is nothing short of a miracle.
In 2005, after just a decade of protection, scientists recorded the largest increase in fish.
But don't take my word for it, come with me.
In a breath, swim into the depths with me amidst one of the largest and most densely packed schools of fish I have ever encountered.
We all have the opportunity to inspire hope.
And through my photos, I would like to convey the message that it is not too late for our oceans.
And I would particularly like to emphasize the resilience of nature in the face of 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I will have to strive tirelessly to take photos like this, while creating images that showcase our respectful coexistence with the ocean which,
I hope will become my everyday life.
To thrive and survive in doing my job, one really has to be an unyielding optimist.
I always work with the thought that the next fabulous image that will serve my purpose is just around the next reef, in the heart of the next lagoon, or who knows, maybe in the one after that.
