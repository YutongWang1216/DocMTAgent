When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the heart of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
The new government was emerging from a long war of independence and immediately announced a socialist program: health services and primary education became essentially free.
A significant expansion of rural health centers placed approximately 80% of the population within two hours' walk of one of these centers, a truly remarkable achievement.
In 1980, the year of independence, 25% of children in Zimbabwe were fully immunized.
In 1990, a decade later, this proportion was 80%.
I felt extremely privileged to be part of this transformation, a revolution.
The excitement, the camaraderie were palpable.
By working with brilliant Zimbabweans — scientists, doctors, activists — I felt connected not only to an African independence movement but to a global progressive movement for public health.
But there were considerable challenges.
Zimbabwe reported its first case of AIDS in 1985, the year of my arrival.
I had cared for a few patients with AIDS in the early 80s during my medical training at Harlem Hospital, but — we had no idea what awaited Africa.
My first days there, the infection rate was 2%.
This would soar and reach one adult in four by the time I left Harare, 17 years later.
In the mid-90s, I had informed hundreds of middle-aged people that they were HIV positive.
I had seen friends and colleagues die, my students, patients at the hospital.
In response to this, my colleagues and I set up a clinic.
We were demonstrating the use of condoms.
We initiated education in schools and interventions in the workplace.
We were conducting research. We provided advice to the partners of infected men so that they would know how to protect themselves.
We worked hard, and at the time, I thought I was doing my best.
I provided excellent treatment, as good as possible.
But I was not talking about structural change.
The former UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, spoke candidly about his personal failure that led to the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was the director of the Peace Department at the UN.
At a memorial ten years later, he said: "At the time, I believed I was doing my best, but I realized after the genocide that I could and should have done more to sound the alarm and gather support."
The AIDS epidemic caught the health community by surprise, and today, when the World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people have died as a result of this disease, I am not alone in feeling remorse and regret for not having done more, sooner.
But when I was living in Zimbabwe, I did not see my role as that of an advocate or a politician.
I was there because of my technical skills, my clinical skills, and my epidemiological research.
For me, my job was to care for patients and conduct research to better understand the patterns of transmission within the population, and I hoped that we would slow the spread of the virus.
I was aware that marginalized populations had a very high risk of having and dying from AIDS.
And in the sugar plantations, which, up close, resembled more feudal fiefdoms than any modern enterprise, 60% of pregnant women were infected with HIV.
I worked to demonstrate that being infected was not a moral failure but rather linked to a culture of male superiority, forced labor of immigrants, and colonialism.
The whites were largely spared.
As healthcare professionals, our tools were pitifully weak: pleading with people to change their individual behavior, to use condoms, and to reduce the number of partners.
Infection rates were rising. And when a treatment became available in the West, a treatment that remained our most powerful weapon against the virus, it was not affordable for the African public sector.
I did not denounce the unequal access to these life-saving medications or the underlying economic and political systems that were driving up infection rates in large segments of the population.
I rationalized my silence by telling myself that I was just a visitor in this country, that sounding the alarm could get me expelled, prevent me from doing my work, taking care of my patients, and conducting much-needed research.
So I did not rebel against the government's initial stance on AIDS.
I did not voice my concerns.
Many doctors and health professionals may think that I did nothing wrong.
Our pact with our patients, the Hippocratic oath and its variants, speaks to the inviolability of the patient-doctor relationship.
I did everything I could for each of the patients I had.
But I knew that epidemics emerge along the fissures of our society, reflecting not only our biology but more notably the patterns of marginalization, exclusion, and discrimination related to race, gender, sexuality, class, and so on.
It was true for AIDS.
It was true recently for Ebola.
Medical anthropologists like Paul Farmer, who worked on AIDS in Haiti, have termed this "structural violence." Structural because inequalities are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world, and are often invisible to the eyes of privileged and powerful individuals; and violence because its impact—premature deaths, suffering, illness—is violent.
We do little for our patients if we do not acknowledge these social injustices.
Sounding the alarm is the first step towards good public health practice, and it is through this that we could gather support to revolutionize and create change together.
Today, I do not remain silent.
I speak about many things, even if they make those who listen uncomfortable, even if they make me uncomfortable.
Much of what I say is related to racial differences and institutionalized racism, issues that are no longer supposed to exist in this country, let alone in medical practice or public health.
But they exist, and we pay for them by shortening lives.
That is why sounding the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the United States, the current institutional and interpersonal violence faced by people of color, intertwined with our sad legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow, and 60 years of imperfect equality, is fundamental to the proper fulfillment of my role as Commissioner of Health for the City of New York.
In New York, premature mortality — that is, dying before reaching the age of 65 — is 50% higher for Black men than for White men.
In 2012, a Black woman was 10 times more likely than a White woman to die during childbirth.
Although we have made tremendous progress in reducing infant mortality rates, a Black baby is still nearly three times more likely than a White baby to die during its first year.
New York is not an exception.
These statistics are compared with statistics gathered across the United States.
A recent analysis by the New York Times reported that there were, in the country,
1.5 million Black men missing. They mentioned that more than one in six Black men who would be between 25 and 54 years old today are no longer leading a normal life, but are either in prison or have died prematurely.
There is a great injustice regarding the daily and disproportionate violence against young Black men, which has been the focus of the recent #BlackLivesMatter protests.
But we must remember that the persistent disparate rates and the occurrence and outcomes of common diseases—heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV—are diseases that can kill slowly and silently, taking even more Black lives prematurely.
When the #BlackLivesMatter movement took shape, I was frustrated and angry that the medical community was reluctant to use the word "racism" in our research and work.
You must have felt something every time I said it.
Our students participated in protests in white coats, but the medical community largely stayed away as current discrimination continues to affect the pattern of diseases and mortality.
And I fear that the trend of personalized and precision medicine, the search for biological or genetic targets for more tailored treatment, might inadvertently cause us to lose sight of the bigger picture, that is, the daily context in which a person lives, grows, works, and loves—fundamental factors in determining the health of the population: for too many of us, poor health.
As healthcare professionals, in our daily work, whether in practice or in research, we witness a great injustice: the homeless who are unable to follow medical advice because they have other priorities; the transgender youth who contemplate suicide because our society is too rigid; the single mother who is made to feel responsible for her child's poor health.
Our role as healthcare professionals is not only to treat our patients but to sound the alarm and promote change.
Whether by right or not, our position in society makes us very credible, and we should not squander that.
I regret not having spoken out in Zimbabwe, and I have promised myself that as Commissioner of Health for the City of New York, I will seize every opportunity I have to sound the alarm and garner support for health equity.
I will denounce racism, and I hope you will join me, and I will join you in denouncing sexism or any other form of inequality.
It is time for us to stand up and, as a community, denounce structural inequalities.
We do not need to have all the answers to call for change.
We only need courage.
The health of our patients, of each and every one of us, depends on it.
