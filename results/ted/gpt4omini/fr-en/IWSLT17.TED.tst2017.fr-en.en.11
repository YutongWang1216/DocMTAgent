You probably do not know Kenema in Sierra Leone, or Arua in Nigeria.
For me, these are the two most extraordinary places on Earth.
There, in the hospitals, there is a community of nurses, doctors, and scientists who have calmly fought one of humanity's deadliest threats for years: the Lassa virus.
The Lassa virus is similar to the Ebola virus.
It can cause a high fever and can often be fatal.
But these people risk their lives every day to protect the individuals in their communities, and ultimately, to protect us all.
One of the most extraordinary things I learned about them, during one of my early visits, a long time ago, was that they start each morning - those difficult mornings on the front lines - by singing.
They come together, and they show their joy and their strength.
Over the years, we have visited each other. I could be among them, singing, and writing. It was extraordinary because it reminds us that we are not here solely for science, but that we are connected by a shared humanity.
You can imagine, it is extremely important, even vital, when things started to change.
The situation changed in March 2014, when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea.
It was the first outbreak in West Africa, near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
It was frightening... We were all terrified.
We had suspected for some time that the Lassa and Ebola viruses were more widespread than previously thought, and that it could reach Kenema.
So, members of my team immediately joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team in the field. We set up diagnostics to conduct molecular tests capable of detecting the arrival of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
We had already managed to control the Lassa virus. We knew how to do it; the team was remarkable.
We simply had to provide them with the tools and the lab for Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day has arrived.
On May 23, 2014, a woman arrived at the maternity ward of the hospital. The team conducted molecular tests and identified the first case of the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone.
It was exceptional work.
They were able to diagnose the case immediately, treat the patient safely, and begin to understand what was happening.
It could have prevented what happened.
But on the day it happened, the outbreak had been brewing for several months.
There were already hundreds of cases, surpassing all previous outbreaks.
It entered Sierra Leone, not as a singular case, but as a tidal wave.
We worked with the international community, the Ministry of Health, and Kenema to manage the cases. The following week there were 31, then 92, then 147 cases; they all came to Kenema, one of the few places in Sierra Leone that could address this issue.
We worked tirelessly, trying everything possible to help each person and to draw attention. We also did something else:
we did not discard the blood tests used to detect Ebola; we placed them in a chemical solution to deactivate them. We packaged them and shipped them across the ocean.
We sent them to Boston, where my team works.
We also worked tirelessly, day after day. We quickly generated 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
The genome is the architectural blueprint of a virus.
We all have one.
It indicates what we are made of, and it conveys so much information about us.
The results of this kind of work are straightforward and very useful.
We took these 99 different viruses, observed and compared them, and found that, when compared to the three genomes that had been previously published in Guinea, the outbreak had emerged in Guinea several months earlier, and that, once in humans, it was transmitted from human to human.
It is very important when one wants to determine how to intervene, as contact tracing is essential.
It was also discovered that the virus mutated as it moved between humans.
Each mutation is important because diagnostics, vaccines, and our therapies are all based on the genome sequence. It is the guide.
Global health experts need to respond, develop, and recalibrate all their work accordingly.
But science doesn't work that way. My position at the time was that I had the data and could have worked in isolation for months, analyzing the data carefully and slowly, submitting a paper for publication, making some revisions, and finally publishing my data after the official publication.
This is how the status quo in science works.
This time, there's no question of acting that way.
We had friends on the ground. For us, it was clear that we needed help, a lot of help...
The first thing we did, as soon as the machine produced the first sequences, was to publish them on the web.
We published them and issued a call for help.
And help arrived!
Quickly, many people reached out to us, surprised by the data we had published.
Some of the world's leading infectious disease specialists were part of our community.
We worked together virtually, sharing regular calls, trying to track the virus minute by minute to see how to stop it.
There are so many ways to form such communities.
Everyone, when the outbreak began to spread globally, wanted to learn, participate, and get involved.
Everyone wanted to play a role.
The number of volunteers was incredible, and the Internet connected us all.
Can you imagine that instead of being afraid of each other, we said: "OK, let's go, by working together,
"We will defeat this virus."
The problem was that the data we were using, while researching on the web, was too limited for our purpose.
We waste a lot of opportunities in these cases.
Thus, when the outbreak was declared in Kenema, we had 106 clinical records of patients, and we made them public.
In our lab, we demonstrated that, armed with these 106 records, we could teach our computers to predict Ebola with an accuracy of about 100%.
We developed an application that provides access to this information for on-site healthcare personnel.
106 cases are unfortunately not sufficient to consolidate and validate the data.
So we were waiting for more data.
But we were still waiting for the data.
We are still waiting, confined in our silos, instead of working together.
This situation is no longer tolerable.
You, all of you, can no longer accept this.
"It is our lives that are at stake."
Many people have lost their lives, including healthcare personnel, and colleagues who were dear to me. Five colleagues lost their lives: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Koroma, and Mohamed Fullah.
These are just five among many others in Kenema and beyond, dead while the world waited and we worked, quietly and separately.
Ebola, like all threats to humanity, is fueled by distrust, confusion, and division.
While we build barriers between us, the virus is spreading.
Unlike all other threats, in the face of Ebola, we are all equal.
We are all in the same boat.
Ebola is at our doorstep.
And so in this place, we share the same vulnerabilities, strengths, fears, and hopes; I wish that we can work together and with joy.
One of my former students was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and she discovered that the term "Kenema," the hospital where we work in Sierra Leone, comes from the Mende phrase for "clear as a river, translucent and open to view."
It held a special meaning for us, because, unbeknownst to us, we had always believed that to honor the individuals in Kenema, we needed to work openly and together.
We must do it.
We must all demand of ourselves and others to be open to one another when an epidemic occurs, and to fight it together.
Because this is neither the first Ebola outbreak nor the last, and there are many other pathogens lurking around us, such as the Lassa virus.
The next outbreak could affect a city of millions of inhabitants.
It could start there and spread through the air.
It could even be spread intentionally.
I know itâ€™s frightening, I understand... but I also know, this experience proves it to us, that we have the technology and the capacity to overcome, to conquer and get ahead of other viruses.
But this is only possible if we collaborate with joy.
For Dr. Khan, and for all those who gave their lives on the front lines in this fight with us, let us stand by their side in this struggle. Always.
Let us not leave the world with the scars of destruction caused by a virus. Let us illuminate it with the brilliance of billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
Thank you.
