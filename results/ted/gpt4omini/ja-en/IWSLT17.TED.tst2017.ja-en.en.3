Since I majored in political science at university, I had to write a lot of reports.
For an ordinary student writing reports, the workload is likely distributed like this.
With this, although it starts off slowly, if you make sufficient progress in the first week, even if the workload increases somewhat in the latter half, an orderly state is maintained.
I also want to do it that way.
As for the plan,
I intend to start right away, but when it actually comes to writing the report, in my case, it ends up being like this.
It always ends up like this.
Then I had to write a 90-page thesis, which is something that should be done over the course of a year.
I knew that the usual approach wouldn't work.
The scale is too large.
So I made a plan and decided to do it like this.
It’s a one-year plan.
At first, it's light, then it slightly increases in the middle, and finally, there's a burst of effort in the last stage; it feels like a gentle staircase.
Climbing this staircase is
It shouldn't be difficult.
However, something strange happened.
The first few months
I came and went, but I couldn't do anything.
Therefore, the plan will be changed as follows.
Then — the middle period also passed, but I was unable to write, and I ended up in this state.
Furthermore, two months turned into one month, and that became two weeks.
One morning, I woke up to find that there were only three days left until the deadline. I hadn't written a single word, and there was no room for choice. I ended up having to write a 90-page thesis in 72 hours and pulled two all-nighters in a row. The human body isn't designed to handle such things, but I dashed through the campus with all my might, time seemed to slow down, and I submitted it just at the moment of the deadline.
I thought that was the end of it all, but
A week later, I received a phone call from the university.
"Is this Tim Urban?"
"Yes."
"I have something to discuss regarding the submitted thesis."
"Ah."
What I was told was, "I've never seen such a wonderful thesis."
Nothing of the sort happened.
It was an absolutely terrible thesis.
I just wanted everyone to think for a moment, "Isn't this person a genius?"
It is an absolutely terrible thesis.
Currently, I am a writer.
I write a blog called "Wait But Why."
About two years ago, I decided to write about "procrastination."
My behavior always puzzled those around me, leading to a reflection on what goes on in the mind of a procrastinator and why we act that way.
I wanted to explain to those who are not procrastinators that there must be a difference between the brains of procrastinators and those who are not.
To confirm this, I decided to find a place that would conduct MRIs of my brain and the brain of someone who is definitely not a procrastinator, and compare the results.
I have brought the results here today.
I hope you will pay attention to see if you can notice the differences.
While I am not a brain expert and the differences may be difficult to discern, well, in any case, please take a look.
This is the brain of someone who is not a procrastinator.
[The rational decision-maker] In contrast,
My brain—
[The monkey that wants a reward immediately] This is the difference between the two.
Both brains have a "rational decision-maker," but in the case of the procrastinator's brain, there is also a "monkey that wants a reward immediately."
How does that relate to procrastination?
Everything was going smoothly, until it came to this point.
"The rational decision-maker says, 'I should probably do some work,' but the monkey responds, 'No way.' While the rational decision-maker makes the logical choice to do something productive, the monkey isn't pleased with that. So it takes control and suggests, 'Right, let's read the Wikipedia article about the Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding incident; I just remembered that happened.'"
Then—I need to check the refrigerator and see if anything has changed in the last ten minutes.
After that, a YouTube spiral awaits, starting with a video of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and continuing all the way to an interview with Justin Bieber's mom.
So I'm really swamped for the time being, so I'm sorry, but I can't today.
"I don't have the luxury to fit in any work."
What is happening?
The monkey is not someone you want at the helm.
I am living only in the present moment.
Without memories of the past or knowledge of the future, the only things that matter are the two that are easy and fun.
In the animal world, that is not a problem.
If you were a dog, spending your time doing only easy and fun things would be a great success in life.
To the monkey, humans are just another type of animal.
As long as you eat well, sleep well, and produce the next generation, that might have been sufficient during primitive times.
We are no longer living in primitive times.
We live in an advanced civilized society, but the monkey does not understand what that is.
The reason there is another "rational decision-maker" in the brain is that it provides abilities not found in other animals.
We envision the future.
The ability to see the bigger picture
We can make long-term plans.
The rational decision-maker takes everything into consideration.
"Now I try to get myself to do what I need to do."
Sometimes it makes sense to do easy and fun things, such as during dinner, when sleeping, or in leisure time.
There are overlapping aspects between the two.
There are times when our opinions align.
However, as a matter of overarching judgment, there are times when it makes sense to engage in difficult and not particularly enjoyable tasks.
In such times, conflicts arise.
In the case of procrastinators, this conflict tends to always result in spending a lot of time on the portions marked in orange, which are activities that don't make sense to do and are easy and fun.
I refer to this area as the "Dark Playground."
The Dark Playground is a place that all procrastinators are well acquainted with.
It is a place where you end up playing when you shouldn't be.
The enjoyment found in the Dark Playground is not truly enjoyable; it is filled with familiar feelings of procrastination such as guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-loathing that should not be experienced.
The issue is how, in a situation where the monkey is at the helm, procrastinators can transition to the blue area, where important things happen, albeit with less comfort.
In fact, procrastinators have a guardian angel who is always watching over them, even in the worst of times; this is also referred to as the "Panic Monster."
The Panic Monster is usually asleep, but it suddenly awakens when a deadline approaches, and terrifying outcomes such as losing face or facing a professional crisis draw near.
What is important is that this is the only thing the monkey fears.
Recently, I had the opportunity to benefit from that. About six months ago, I was contacted by the people at TED and invited to give a TED Talk.
Of course, I replied, "I will do it."
"It has been my long-standing dream to be able to say, 'I once gave a TED Talk.'"
"I have given a TED Talk before." In the midst of this excitement, the rational decision-maker is concerned with something else.
"Do you understand what you have committed to?"
Do you understand what will happen on some future day?
"I need to buckle down and get started right now!"
The monkey responds, "I completely agree, but for now, let's open Google Earth, zoom in to 60 meters above the ground at the southern tip of India, and scroll for two and a half hours until we reach the northern end. That way, we might get a better sense of India."
So, I spent the entire day doing just that.
Six months turned into four months, then two months, then one month, and TED released the list of speakers.
When I opened that page, I saw my own face staring back at me.
So, who awakened?
The Panic Monster went into a frenzy, and the entire system was thrown into chaos.
Remember that the monkey fears the Panic Monster, which is why it runs up the tree.
Finally, the rational decision-maker was able to take the helm, and I could start preparing for the lecture.
The Panic Monster can also explain the procrastinator's erratic behavior, as it can seem miraculous when they suddenly awaken to an intense work ethic after two weeks of being unable to write even the first line of their report, leading them to stay up all night and produce eight pages.
This is the overall situation of the system involving three characters: the procrastinator.
It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.
This is the content I decided to write about on my blog two years ago.
When I started writing, I was surprised by the response to the blog.
Literally thousands of emails poured in from all over the world, from a truly diverse range of people.
Nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and indeed, many graduate students.
Everyone was writing the same thing: "I have the same problem."
However, the lightness of that blog post contrasted sharply with the weight of the emails I received.
It was written with a strong frustration about the impact procrastination has on their lives, all because of that monkey.
Looking at that, I wondered how the procrastinator's system could possibly work.
Why are they in such a bleak state?
What I realized is that there are two types of procrastination.
In the example I discussed, there was a deadline.
When there is a deadline, the effects of procrastination are limited to a short period, and the Panic Monster emerges.
However, there is another type of procrastination that does not involve a deadline.
In the case of entrepreneurial work, such as that of individual entrepreneurs or artists, there are initially no deadlines; nothing happens until you go out, do something, and get the ball rolling.
Additionally, there are many important things outside of work that do not have deadlines, such as visiting family, exercising to maintain health, building relationships, and resolving dysfunctional relationships.
If the mechanism for procrastinators to tackle such difficult tasks were solely the Panic Monster, there would be a problem, as the Panic Monster does not appear in situations without deadlines.
Without anything to awaken it, the influence of procrastination remains unbounded, leading to a perpetual state of procrastination.
Such long-term types of procrastination are less noticeable and less discussed compared to the humorous and short-term procrastination associated with deadlines. Typically, they torment individuals in silence.
Long-term and significant unhappiness and regret
It can serve as a source; I thought that was the reason those people wrote emails and why they find themselves in such a terrible situation.
It is not that I am stuck in a project.
Long-term procrastination makes one feel like a bystander in their own life.
Their frustration lies not in being unable to realize their dreams, but in not even being able to start pursuing them.
While reading such emails, I had a realization: there is no one who is not a procrastinator.
Everyone is a procrastinator.
While I may not be as chaotic as I am, you might be maintaining a healthy relationship with deadlines. However, be aware that the issue with the monkeys is the most insidious when there are no deadlines.
Finally, there is one more thing I would like to show you.
"It's a 'Life Calendar.'"
Each box represents a week in a 90-year life.
It's not like there are that many. Moreover, we've already used quite a bit of them.
I think we should all take a good look at this calendar.
What is it that I am truly procrastinating on? After all, everyone must be procrastinating on something.
We need to be aware of the monkeys that want immediate rewards.
This is a task for all of us.
Considering that there aren't that many boxes, this work should be started today.
Well, even if it's not today.
If possible
Before long
Thank you.
