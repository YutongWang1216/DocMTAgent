I have longed for the sea since I was a child.
It is a wonderful place filled with color and life, a habitat for strange creatures that resemble aliens.
I imagined a large shark dominating the food chain and a graceful sea turtle gliding across the coral reef.
I transitioned from being a marine biologist to a photographer, dedicating most of my work to exploring magical places that I dreamed of when I was small.
As you can see, I have been exploring underwater since I was quite small.
But the first time I truly dove underwater was when I was about 10 years old.
I still vividly remember swimming fiercely, trying to touch an old cannon on the shallow coral.
And finally, as I grasped it and looked up, I was instantly surrounded by colorful fish. That was the day I fell in love with the sea.
Thomas Peschak, conservation photographer, has lived on Earth for 40 years, and I have been given the invaluable opportunity to explore the wonders of the ocean for National Geographic and the Save Our Seas Foundation.
I have photographed everything, from enormous sharks to adorable creatures that fit in the palm of my hand.
I witnessed a very fishy-breathed humpback whale feeding just 30 centimeters away off the cold coast of Canada's Great Bear Rainforest.
I have also been present at the mating of green sea turtles in the Mozambique Channel.
All people and the ocean on Earth have influenced each other.
And it has become increasingly difficult to find untouched oceans like the ones I dreamed of when I was a child.
We are increasingly being cornered and threatened.
We, humanity, have continued to be the primary capturers on Earth, but I have gradually witnessed and documented the expanding impact of that influence firsthand.
I have long thought that by using shocking photographs, I could capture people's interest.
There are advantages to this initiative, but I have returned to my roots.
I thought that the best way to bring about change is to appeal to love.
I might be a kind of intermediary. As a photographer, I have been fortunate to have the invaluable opportunity to reveal the entirety of the animals and ecosystems hidden beneath the surface of the ocean.
If you are unaware of something's existence, you cannot cherish or protect it.
Revealing hidden forms is the true power of photography in conservation efforts.
I have visited hundreds of marine areas, but there are a few that have particularly left a deep impression on me.
The first time I experienced such excitement was ten years ago, off the rocky, unspoiled coast of South Africa.
Every year, in June and July, massive schools of sardines embark on a great migration northward known as the Sardine Run.
There is a proper reason for this.
Because hungry, swift predators are secretly pursuing them with incredible speed.
Generally, dolphins hunt in groups, separating some sardines from the school to create a bait ball, which is a spherical aggregation.
They drive the fish up to the surface of the sea to partake in this living, moving feast.
There is a shark right behind me.
Many people believe that dolphins and sharks are natural enemies, but during the Sardine Run, they actually coexist.
Dolphins assist sharks in efficiently hunting for food.
Without dolphins, the bait ball would become more dispersed, and sharks would get trapped in what is known as the Sardine Doughnut, filling their mouths with water and gaining nothing.
Now, I have also experienced thrilling moments with sharks during the Sardine Run, and I understand that they do not see me as prey.
However, during this wild feast, they do collide and get struck by fins, just like the other fish.
Moving east from the coast of Africa and crossing the vast Indian Ocean, I arrive at the coral-formed Maldives.
During the intense southwest monsoon season, the Manta Rays come to a very small spot in the Hanifaru Lagoon, which is located throughout the islands. Typically, a large number of crustaceans, smaller than the human eye, serve as the main food source for the Manta Rays.
When there are fluctuations in the location of plankton, the Manta Rays hunt for food alone, and they perform backflips repeatedly, resembling a puppy chasing its own tail.
However, when the plankton concentrate in one spot, the rays line up to form a long chain for feeding. Even if the ray at the front misses a few plankton, the following rays are sure to swallow them.
As the amount of plankton increases, the rays swim closer together. This unique behavior is referred to as cyclone feeding.
The rays spiral in a solid formation, creating multiple layers of columns that gather plankton in a whirlpool and transport it to their cavernous mouths as they suck it in.
The experience of diving surrounded by hundreds of rays is truly unforgettable.
When I first photographed in Hanifaru, it was unprotected and threatened by development.
By working alongside NGOs like Manta Trust, my photographs eventually helped Hanifaru become a marine protected area.
Fishermen from the neighboring islands once caught rays to make traditional drums from their skins.
Currently, they are more passionate about conservation than anyone else, and thanks to the rays, the Maldives has begun to earn an additional eight million dollars each year.
I have always wanted to go back to a time when maps were almost blank or marked with "Here be dragons."
The closest I have been to the ocean of that era was the atolls on the western side of the Indian Ocean.
Diving into such waters, far removed from shipping lanes and fishing fleets, one can acutely feel the essence of the ocean as it once was.
Most people have probably never heard of the small coral reef known as Basses de la India in the Mozambique Channel.
The coral reef acts as a barrier, creating a lagoon that serves as a nursery for the Galapagos shark.
This shark cannot be described as very timid, even during the day.
I had a feeling that they would become bolder and come out in greater numbers at night.
Have I ever encountered so many sharks at a single coral outcrop before?
By capturing and sharing moments like these, I am reminded of the reason I chose this path.
This year, I have already done work for National Geographic in the Baja California Peninsula.
On the Pacific side of the peninsula, about halfway along, lies the San Ignacio Lagoon, an important breeding ground for the gray whale.
This coastal area has been a site of mass slaughter for a century, where over 20,000 gray whales were killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
Currently, the descendants of those whales gently push their young to the surface to play and even interact with us.
This species has truly made an astonishing comeback.
Now, on the opposite side of the peninsula, there is a quiet fishing village called Cabo Pulmo.
It was on the verge of collapse due to decades of overfishing.
In 1995, local fishermen appealed for that sea to be designated as a marine protected area.
What happened next can only be described as a miracle.
By 2005, just ten years after the protection efforts began, the number of fish had achieved an unprecedented recovery.
But see for yourself. Let's go together.
Taking a deep breath, let's dive deep and swim into the largest and most dense school of fish I have ever encountered.
Everyone can create hope.
Through my photographs, I want to convey that it is still not too late to protect our oceans.
I particularly want to focus on the resilience of nature in the face of 7.3 billion people.
My wish is to capture photographs that serve as examples of coexistence with the ocean, as in the future it will require much more effort to find such scenes.
I can only hope that it becomes a regular occurrence.
To survive and move forward in my profession, I must be an incorrigible optimist.
I always work under the assumption that the amazing photographs that can inspire change are just around the corner, beyond that coral, within that lagoon, or perhaps just a little further ahead.
