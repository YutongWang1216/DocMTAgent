This is a discussion about how we acquire knowledge.
The main character of the story is this woman, Natalia Lipchinsky.
She is a paleontologist, specializing in excavating ancient remains.
Natalia Lipchinsky: I used to have people call me the "Doctor of Remains."
Latif Nassar: What I found particularly interesting is that the excavation site is far to the north in the remote tundra of Canada, well within the Arctic Circle.
One summer day in 2006, she was at an excavation site called the Files Leaf Bed, which is less than 10 degrees latitude from the magnetic North Pole.
Natalia: You might think it's boring, as I just walk around all day with a backpack, holding a GPS and a notebook, picking up what seem to be fossils.
Latif: At one point, she noticed something.
Natalia: It's an old, reddish-brown object about the size of my palm.
It was lying on the ground.
Latif: At first, I thought it was just a piece of wood, because fragments of ancient plants are often found at the Files Leaf Bed.
However, that night, we returned to the camp —
Natalia: When I took out the magnifying glass and looked at it more closely, I noticed that there were no growth rings.
It might be due to the state of preservation, but the more I looked at it —
It was a bone.
Latif: She visited this site many times over the course of more than four years and ultimately collected 30 fragments of the same bone, most of which are very small.
Natalia: There aren’t many; they fit into a small plastic bag.
Latif: I tried to piece the fragments together like a puzzle, but
It was truly a difficult task.
Natalia: Since they were broken and shattered, I tried to use sand and putty, but it didn’t work well.
So in the end, I used a 3D scanner.
Latif: That's amazing! Natalia: Right?
Latif: It's much easier to work on the screen.
Natalia: I was a bit moved when everything came together.
Latif: How confident were you that the way you assembled it was correct?
What is the possibility that a different assembly would result in something else? Like, it could actually have been a parrot?
Natalia: No, there is no mistake.
Latif: What she discovered was a phalanx, specifically a leg bone, and it belonged to an even-toed ungulate, which refers to relatives of cattle and sheep.
However, this bone could not have belonged to cattle or sheep.
It was too large.
Natalia: It was an extra-large size; it belonged to a very large animal.
Latif: What kind of animal was it?
Frustrated, she showed one of the bone fragments to a colleague in Colorado, and that was when the inspiration struck her.
Natalia: When we made a cut at the end of the bone with a saw, it had a distinctive smell.
Latif: It had a smell like burnt meat.
It was the same smell she had encountered when she severed the skull in the eerie dissection room. It was collagen.
Collagen plays a role in maintaining the structure of the bone.
As time passes, it typically decomposes.
In this case, the climate of the Arctic Circle acted as a natural refrigerator, preserving the remains.
About one to two years later, when Natalia attended a conference in Bristol, her colleague Mike Buckley was demonstrating a new processing method called "collagen analysis."
Each animal has a slightly different collagen structure, and if we can understand the characteristics of the collagen in the unknown bone, we may be able to compare it with those of known animals and perhaps even identify it.
So, she sent one of the bone fragments via courier.
Natalia: It was important to me, so I wanted to track it.
Latif: He compared the bone fragments with 37 species of modern mammals.
I found a matching animal.
The owner of the 3.5-million-year-old bone that Natalia excavated in the high-latitude Arctic Circle is, surprisingly,
It was a camel.
Natalia: "I thought, 'Huh?' If it's true, that would be amazing."
Latif: I examined many bone fragments, but the results were all the same.
However, considering the size of the discovered bone, this camel was 30% larger than modern ones.
The height was approximately 2.7 meters — the weight was about one ton.
That's right.
What Natalia discovered was a "giant Arctic camel."
What you all imagine when you hear "camel" is the Bactrian camel, which inhabits East and Central Asia.
The image in your mind is surely that of the dromedary camel. When it comes to desert creatures, this is it. It lives in hot deserts such as the Middle East and the Sahara, storing water in its large hump for long journeys across the desert, and it strides firmly over the sand dunes with its broad, sturdy feet.
Why did such an animal reach the Arctic Circle in northern Canada?
In fact, there is something that scientists have known for a long time, even before Natalia's discovery: the original homeland of camels is America.
It was born here.
It has been about 45 million years since camels first appeared, and for nearly 40 million of those years, they were distributed solely in North America, with approximately 20 species, possibly even more.
Latif: Did you notice any differences when you lined them all up?
Natalia: Yes, the sizes of the bodies varied.
There were also types with very long necks, similar to that of a giraffe.
Latif: There were also some that had faces resembling those of crocodiles.
Natalia: The early primitive camels were very small, about the size of a rabbit.
Latif: What? A rabbit-sized camel?
Natalia: It's an early type.
You probably wouldn't be able to tell just by looking at it.
Latif: I’d like to have a rabbit-sized camel.
Natalia: Yes, it must be the best.
Latif: After that, between 3 to 7 million years ago, herds of camels migrated down to South America, evolving into llamas and alpacas. Another group crossed the Bering land bridge and traveled to Asia and Africa.
Towards the end of the last Ice Age, camels in North America became extinct.
Up to this point, what has been discovered is already known. However, it cannot be fully explained why such a creature was found so far north.
For example, in terms of temperature, it is the complete opposite of the Sahara.
Certainly, the average temperature 3.5 million years ago was 22 degrees higher than today.
Therefore, it is possible that coniferous forests spread across the region, resembling the current Yukon River basin and Siberia.
However, even so, winter would have lasted for six months, and the ponds would have frozen over.
There could also be blizzards.
There may have been periods when the darkness of night lasted for 24 hours.
So, what on earth...
How did this superstar of the Sahara manage to survive in the climate of the Arctic Circle?
Natalia and her fellow scholars believe they have found the answer.
Moreover, it is a remarkable answer.
What if the characteristics of camels that we have believed to have evolved to adapt to places like the Sahara actually evolved to survive the winter?
What if the wide feet were not meant for walking on sand, but for walking on snow like snowshoes?
What if the hump on their backs, which I was surprised to learn is filled not with water but with fat, helped them survive the food-scarce winters lasting six months?
What if, after crossing the land bridge, it took some time for them to adapt their winter characteristics to benefit them in the hot desert environment?
For example, the hump might also be beneficial in hot climates, as storing fat in one location like a backpack would eliminate the need to cover the entire body with insulating fat.
This would make it easier to release heat.
This incredible idea suggests that what was once considered typical evidence of adaptation to the desert may actually serve as proof of having lived in the high-latitude Arctic Circle.
I am not the first to tell this story.
Others have used this story to convey the wonders of evolutionary biology and to provide clues for understanding future climate change.
But the reason I like this story is different.
For me, this is a story about myself and our worldview, and how it changes.
I have been educated as a historian.
What has become clear is that most scientists are also historians.
They also strive to understand the past.
It tells the history of the universe, planets, and life on Earth.
As a historian, I begin by contemplating the unfolding of the narrative.
Natalia: We create stories and become fixated on them, such as the story of the desert camel.
It's a wonderfully crafted story; camels are perfectly adapted.
Since they have always been in the desert.
Latif: But someday, a small piece of evidence may be found.
By understanding the small details, it may be possible to reconstruct everything you believed.
In this case as well, it was the discovery of a fossil resembling a piece of wood by a single scientist that led science to an entirely new hypothesis, surpassing common understanding, about why this animal appears as it does, reminiscent of something out of a Dr. Seuss picture book.
My perspective on camels has completely changed.
The perspective has shifted from viewing camels as extremely specialized animals that can only adapt to a specific environment like the desert, to recognizing them as creatures that, while currently found in the Sahara, are actually capable of living anywhere across the globe.
(Applause) This is Azuri.
Hello, Azuri.
Here you go: "Here, eat this."
Azuri usually performs at Radio City Music Hall, but
I'm not joking.
Now, this Azuri is living proof that the story about our world is a dynamic one.
We must reconstruct and reimagine the stories.
Right? Azuri.
Beyond a fragment of bone lies a new perspective on the world.
Thank you.
