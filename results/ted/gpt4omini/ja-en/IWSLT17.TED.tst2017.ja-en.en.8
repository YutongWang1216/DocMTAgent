In 1985, when I moved to Harare, the core of Zimbabwe's healthcare policy was centered on social justice.
After a long independence war, a new regime emerged and immediately declared socialist policies, making healthcare services and primary education fundamentally free.
Significantly increasing the number of community healthcare facilities, they achieved a remarkable outcome where approximately 80% of the population could access medical facilities within a two-hour walk.
In 1980, when Zimbabwe gained independence, the domestic vaccination rate for children was 25%.
Just ten years later, in 1990, it reached 80%.
I truly felt proud to be involved in this great reform.
The excitement and unity of the people were visibly apparent.
I felt a sense of pride to stand alongside the highly capable local scientists, doctors, and activists, becoming part of not only the African independence movement but also a leading global public health movement.
However, there was a terrifying problem.
The year I arrived, 1985, saw the first reported case of AIDS in Zimbabwe.
In the early 1980s, I had seen a few AIDS patients during my residency at Harlem Hospital, but I had no idea what was looming over Africa.
The HIV infection rate during the early days of my stay was about 2%.
This had surged, and by the time I left Harare 17 years later, one in four adults was infected.
By the mid-1990s, I had diagnosed hundreds of working-age individuals as HIV positive.
I experienced the deaths of colleagues and friends, and I also witnessed the deaths of students and patients.
In response, I established a clinic with my colleagues.
demonstrating how to use condoms
initiating sex education in schools and workplaces
conducting case investigations and providing guidance on prevention methods to the partners of those infected
I was doing my best at that time and believed I was giving it my all.
I thought I was providing excellent treatment; looking back now, it seems rather inadequate.
However, I was not engaged in activities that sought structural reform.
Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan candidly acknowledged that his missteps led Rwanda to genocide.
He stated that he was the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations in 1994, the year the genocide occurred.
At the memorial ceremony for the tenth anniversary of the genocide, reflecting on that time, he said, "I was convinced that I was doing my best back then, but after the genocide occurred, I realized that there was much more I could have done and should have done. I recognized that there were things I could have done to sound the alarm and garner cooperation."
The AIDS epidemic caught the medical community off guard, and with the World Health Organization estimating that 39 million lives have been lost to AIDS to date, I am not the only one who regrets that we should have acted sooner.
However, during my time in Zimbabwe, I did not position myself to advocate for change or take a political stance.
Since I came here as a clinician and an epidemiological researcher to utilize my professional skills,
In my heart, I believed that my role was to care for patients and conduct research to deepen my understanding of the infection patterns among the community, hoping that this would help to curb the spread of the virus.
I was aware that the risk of developing AIDS and dying from it was disproportionately high among socially vulnerable groups.
At a sugarcane plantation, which resembled a feudal manor more than any modern corporate organization, 60% of pregnant women were HIV positive.
I taught that just because someone is infected, it does not mean that they are immoral; rather, it is a product of a male-dominated culture, forced seasonal labor, and colonialism.
The white population was largely unaffected.
As healthcare workers, we felt painfully powerless, merely pleading for individuals to change their behavior, use condoms, and reduce the number of sexual partners.
The infection rate continued to rise. While treatment drugs were developed in the West—currently the most effective AIDS treatments—they remained out of reach for any public sector across Africa.
I remained silent about the fact that life-saving medication was not equally accessible, as well as the political and economic systems underlying the AIDS epidemic—about the mechanisms that led to such widespread infection.
I justified my silence, telling myself, "I am not a resident of this country, and if I raise alarms, I could even be expelled. I wouldn't be able to do my job effectively, care for patients, or conduct the necessary research."
So I remained silent, without expressing any opinions about the government's policies on AIDS at the time.
I did not sufficiently express my concerns.
Many doctors and healthcare workers would likely think that I had no fault in this.
It is a promise between doctors and patients—the "Hippocratic Oath" and its variations establish the sanctity of the relationship between physicians and patients.
I did everything I could. I did my utmost for each and every one of my patients.
However, I realized that such a widespread epidemic reflected the distortions in society; it was not solely due to biological causes, but rather stemmed from customs that marginalize, exclude, and discriminate against the vulnerable. This includes discrimination based on race, gender, sexuality, and social class.
AIDS fits this description.
The recent Ebola outbreak was similar.
Medical anthropologists like Paul Farmer, who have been involved in AIDS prevention efforts in Haiti, refer to this as "structural violence." The term "structural" indicates that inequality is embedded within the political and economic structures of our society, often rendering it invisible to those who hold privilege and power. It is termed "violence" because the consequences of this phenomenon—premature death, suffering, and illness—are indeed violent.
If we wish to be of any help to our patients, we must not neglect to recognize these social inequalities.
Calling for attention is the first step to making public health effective. By doing so, we can gather collaborators, pave the way together, and bring about true transformation.
Therefore, I have not remained silent recently either.
I have been speaking out about many issues, even when what I say may make listeners uncomfortable, and even when I feel awkward myself while doing so.
In many cases, issues such as racial disparities and institutionalized racism should no longer exist in this country, and they are even less permissible in the fields of healthcare and public health.
Because it exists, people are losing their lives as a consequence, failing to live out their full lifespan.
Therefore, it is my duty to sound the alarm—regarding the racism in American healthcare and the ongoing systemic and interpersonal violence—against people of color, which has been exacerbated by the painful legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow laws, and 60 years of incomplete equality. This mission is at the core of my role as the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Health.
The mortality rate for individuals under 65 years of age is 50% higher for Black men compared to White men in New York City.
In 2012, the maternal mortality rate for Black women was more than ten times that of White women.
Although the infant survival rate has improved dramatically, Black infants are still nearly three times more likely to die within their first year compared to White infants.
New York is not the only place that is special.
Similar statistics can be found anywhere in America.
According to a recent analysis by The New York Times, there are 1.5 million Black men missing across the United States.
According to the article, today more than one in six Black men aged 25 to 54 are missing from daily life, either incarcerated or having died young.
There is extreme injustice occurring daily, particularly against young Black men, which is the violence targeted by the protests known as #BlackLivesMatter.
However, it is important to remember that, although the incidence rates vary, the occurrence and outcomes of common diseases—such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and AIDS—continue to persist; these are illnesses that lead to slow and quiet deaths. As a result of these diseases, Black individuals are losing even more lives.
When the #BlackLivesMatter movement began, I felt a sense of frustration and anger because the term "racism" had even been avoided in the medical field in research and practice.
Every time I use this term, I imagine that you all have some thoughts about it as well.
While medical students dressed as corpses staged protests, most people in the medical community stood by and did nothing, even though the discrimination that still persists continues to impact the manifestation of diseases and mortality rates. What concerns me is...
In the contemporary trend towards personalized and precision medicine, while seeking treatments tailored to individuals and pursuing biological and genetic research, there is a risk of inadvertently losing sight of the bigger picture. It is the everyday environment—where people live, grow, work, and love—that most profoundly affects health, and it is this very environment that harms the health of far too many individuals.
As healthcare professionals, we witness extreme inequities in our daily work, both in clinics and in research. The reason a homeless person cannot follow a doctor's guidance is due to more pressing priorities. A transgender youth contemplating suicide is a reflection of a merciless society. Single mothers bear the burden of their children's health conditions.
The role of a physician as a healthcare professional is not only to see patients but also to call for attention and become an advocate for change.
Physicians carry significant weight in their statements due to their social status, regardless of the legitimacy of their claims, and this should not be wasted.
I regret not raising my voice in Zimbabwe and made a vow to myself that, as the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Health, I will fully utilize the opportunities I have to raise awareness and call for collaboration to improve healthcare disparities.
I will also stand against racism. Please lend a hand. When you confront gender discrimination, I will lend my strength as well. I will support efforts against any other form of inequality.
Now is the time for us to stand up and raise our voices as a collective against structural inequality.
To call for change, it is not necessary to have all the answers.
All it takes is courage.
Our patients' health and all of our health are at stake.
