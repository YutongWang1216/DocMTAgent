At that moment, I was anxiously waiting for the final moments of my life in a church in Texas, where souls and bodies were in turmoil.
In such a venue, I sat shallowly on a dilapidated wooden chair covered with a tattered red cloth, with an organ to my left, the choir behind me, and further back, a baptismal font was prepared.
There is no change at all.
A surging sense of tension, a fervent wish for salvation, sweaty palms, and those seated in the back, who seemed rather disinterested.
On December 31, 1999, the night of Christ's second coming, it was when I believed the world would end.
That year, I turned exactly 12 years old, the age officially recognized in the scriptures as coming of age.
Yet, I found myself wanting to complain about how unfair it was that the world would come to an end, but it was already too late for that. I was compelled to reconsider my future.
I resolved to change my heart and attend church as much as possible.
I prayed so earnestly that I lost track of time, desperately hoping that God would overlook my lack of faith and that His coming would not occur sooner than expected.
Furthermore, to be extra cautious, I was devouring books of the kind that were popular at the time, pleading, "Please save me."
At one point, I found in the text that if even one person lacked faith at the destined time, further tragedy awaited.
In any case, the task assigned to me was to control all desires, to overcome the devil and inertia, and to achieve victory over my own lack of faith.
It's difficult at the age of 12, but let's believe we can do it.
At last, the time is drawing near.
11:50 PM
With just 10 minutes remaining, the pastor gathered us before the altar to welcome the moment when the hands of the clock would point to the fateful hour, accompanied by deep prayer.
People from all denominations will gather in one place.
The choir remained in their seats, while the deacons and their wives — in other words, the bourgeois church members — took their positions at the very front of the altar.
As you know, in America, even for the Second Coming of Christ, VIP seats are provided.
(Applause) Right behind the VIPs are the elderly. I think of their backs, which worked tirelessly in the cotton fields under the blazing sun of East Texas during their youth. Their sun-kissed, unwrinkled skin resembles the very earth itself, and they are people who have held onto dreams of what their lives could have been, only to have those hopes betrayed time and again. Yes, those are the people.
They are, for me, the true main characters.
They have devoted their entire lives to this moment, much like the ancestors of the Middle Ages who eagerly awaited the arrival of the end times, finding purpose in the talk show that starts every day at 4 PM.
Like my grandmother, she too moves toward the altar. I secretly followed her back, certain that she would surely go to heaven.
I was thinking that if I held her hand during prayer, perhaps I could go to heaven with her.
I held her hand, closed my eyes, and listened intently as I prayed.
The pastor's voice was rough.
The prayer in response turned into a cry that echoed throughout the church.
The melody of the keyboard intensified.
The accompanying fervor enveloped the church.
To ensure I am not left behind, I grasp my grandmother's hand once more.
Faced with the terror of destiny, I retreated into the darkness behind my eyelids.
And that voice descends, "Amen."
It is over.
The hands of the clock
The fateful hour has already passed.
The Savior did not appear, and I watched them, my eyes wandering, trying not to reveal my disappointment. Having closed my eyes for too long and too deeply, I was unable to even notice the new possibilities.
I felt a pain in my heart at the sight of them.
They were deceived; they were victims of a trick, and I was one of them as well.
I have been continuing to pray, making sure not to neglect my efforts to resist temptation.
I am someone who has experienced that trial by baptism not once, but twice, and I believed.
Until that moment, indeed.
When I got home and turned on the television, Peter Jennings was celebrating the dawn of the new century, and that news was being broadcast around the world.
At that moment, a strange thought crossed my mind: Could it be that God descends repeatedly while being mindful of time zones?
This revelation was both absurd and cruel.
However, even so, I did not stop believing.
And then I embraced a new faith: the belief that there is not just one answer.
My answer was wrong; the problem itself was wrong. It is a belief that confronts that absurdity.
A new ray of sunlight breaks through the frozen, motionless winter mountains of "faith," as the melting snow of possibility begins to flow toward unseen landscapes.
I still look back on that night when the Savior did not come, reflecting on that moment when everything I believed crumbled in an instant; even if it was not a lie, I knew in that moment that it was not the truth.
Among the many people who celebrated the moment of 2000 in entirely different ways, there may be some who, like me, have ended up here after a similar journey. Starting from the dawn of the new century, my mother left, I lost contact with my father, and even God rejected me on that day.
I reached out, determined to grasp something I could believe in this time.
At 18, I enrolled at Yale University, thinking at the time that it was a perfect opportunity to part ways with all the dark pasts of those I had seen in Oak Cliff, Texas—people whose dreams and hopes had been shattered.
However, one day during winter break, I found myself lying face down on the floor of my home, with my hands tightly bound behind my back and a robber pressing a gun to my head. It was then that I finally realized that education would not save me.
In 2008, I reached out in search of my next salvation—it was the company called Lehman Brothers.
With a bright future ahead, I hurriedly called home, promising that I would no longer suffer from lack of money.
However, even the financial hub crumbled before my eyes with a loud noise. I had been abandoned even by business.
I will not give up and will reach out for the next hope as a youth staff in Washington. The voices coming from Illinois shout loudly, "The time has come!" "Change will come to America."
However, Congress came to a standstill, the nation was rather torn apart by hope, and "change" became an unfunny joke. Even with the Second Coming of politics, nothing happened. There was no salvation.
I certainly pledged my allegiance at that altar, named the American Dream, kneeling before the god of capitalism for success, wealth, and power.
Nevertheless, at the moment the date changed, I kept my eyes open, wondering if God truly was not there.
I decided to confront that night once more; it was not out of bravery, but because I had no choice left but to either die or believe.
And so I moved on to my next holy place: Harvard Business School. I did not succumb to the appealing promise of salvation at that time because I knew better.
I still haven't put in enough effort.
It was a night not long after the harsh winter in Cambridge had begun, when a topic came up among three friends in a corner of a lively party, a commonplace conversation that anyone young would have experienced at least once: "Shall we go on a trip?"
I had not decided where I should go or how I should get there.
However, I was captivated by Jack Kerouac's novel. "To slip away into the night and quietly disappear," we set off to discover what was really happening in this country.
Of course, there were many opposing voices, and above all, those voices were quite reasonable; nonetheless, I took a step forward.
In the summer of 2013, a journey of 8,000 miles across America began. We traversed the grasslands of Montana, the ruins of Detroit, and the swamps of New Orleans. The lives of the people we met along the way, striving to make a living for that day, were vividly depicted.
I found it rather innovative, having been shaped at the highest institution of capitalism.
This idea grew and transformed into the nonprofit organization "MBAs Across America," and it was this wave that brought me to the stage at TED.
How greedy our generation is towards purpose and meaning.
We became aware of the signs of that wave, realizing that countless entrepreneurs, who are creating jobs and driving change in the shadows, need just a little more support.
We finally realized it, and to be honest, another important point is that I too made an effort to create a wave.
Each social enterprise can heal and comfort the wounds of this crumbling nation, enabling as many people as possible to believe that they can rise again. Indeed, such thoughts once existed.
However, this journey of evangelism has led me to a new gospel, and that is precisely why I stand here today.
About a year ago, one evening, I was at the American Museum of Natural History in New York for a gathering of alumni from Harvard Business School.
Underneath the life-sized replica of a whale hanging from the ceiling, I shared a seat with the pioneers of the times, celebrating our alumni's achievements and the spirit of social contribution.
The gathering of people there, along with their assets, filled the space with pride, easily exceeding $500 billion.
Looking over the achievements we have accomplished, each one is beautiful.
However, that was not the end. Two days later, I had business in the Harlem area. Sitting in a corner of a farm built on what was once an empty lot, I listened to stories about the children who came to the farm every day from a man named Tony.
These are stories about children living below the poverty line.
Even when they sleep, they hold their belongings tightly to avoid theft in the homeless shelter.
Children living below the poverty line come to a program named "Harlem Grown," created by Tony, seeking a meal once a day.
After working as a taxi driver for 20 years, Tony began that program by depleting his pension.
He does not receive a salary because, while his activities expand, he struggles with funding.
He said he was willing to cling to any straw.
And I resolve to become that straw.
On the way home, a dull sound echoed deep within my chest, and tears flowed uncontrollably.
I was far too ignorant. Under one roof, replicas of whales floated, and people who moved $500 billion gathered, while just 50 blocks north, under another sky, a man was tirelessly working without pay to prepare meals for children.
I did not weep out of inequality, nor out of pity for the hungry or the homeless. It was neither anger at the wealth held by the top 1% nor sympathy for the poverty of the 99%.
I was simply unsettled in the face of the fact that my country, burdened with kidney disease, relied on me as a dialysis machine.
I realized that my story exists for those who must continue to walk even if they do not have shoes. My organization is here to deliver effective aid to the overlooked areas of Harlem, Appalachia, and the disaster-stricken regions of New Orleans, and my voice was precisely meant to amplify all those voiceless voices that have been deemed uneducated and innocent.
That revelation completely shamed me, and I was reminded of the new century heralded by Peter Jennings, where the absurdities were repeated over and over again, deceived and misled.
I was deceived.
However, this time I was the false Savior myself. I had strayed quite far from that altar on the night I believed the world would end. I thought that suffering was the atonement to God, that the word of God was everything, and that the scriptures were the truth.
I have come a long way from that world I once believed in, and now I stand back at the starting point.
The era we live in now is not a time of disbelief. On the contrary, we believe, and we do so without yielding to the past.
There are those who believe in Brené Brown; it could be Tony Robbins as well.
"The New Yorker" "Harvard Business Review"
There are surely those who believe in them. Above all, right now, in the church of TED, we are offering our prayers, aren’t we? We want to believe; believing is essential for us.
We are yearning for leaders who can solve every challenge.
I am convinced that suffering is a necessary evil within the god of capitalism, and I believe that the scripture of technological advancement is absolute.
However, in fearing that what we believe may be shaken from its foundation, we neglect to question each element of that foundation, and as a result, the human sacrifices that arise from this oversight go unnoticed.
If there is something that you must accept that is hindering you, it is time to stop and reassess.
The gospel that proclaims creativity and innovation, along with responsibility towards society, the environment, and the economy, is not within my realm.
In fact, I am not trying to spread any doctrinal gospel here.
I am here for the existence of the gospel of doubt.
This gospel does not tell you to stop believing; it simply calls for a new attitude: the understanding that there is not just one answer.
Accepting past mistakes leaves room to acknowledge that the questioning itself may be flawed, recognizing that absurdity.
This gospel of doubt suggests that everything in this place and this space may be wrong.
"The question of 'why' is precisely the gospel."
What need is there for people to suffer aimlessly to the point of abandoning the power given to us to question?
From this belief in questioning, I made a certain decision regarding my activities: I transformed "MBAs Across America" into a nonprofit organization.
We reduced the organization's staff, halted new hiring, and made our business model publicly accessible and shareable for those in need.
The questioning of "why" called upon me to abandon the role of savior that people had imposed on me. In the face of the truth that miracles do not happen, our lives are far too short to wait once again for the Second Coming of Christ.
This gospel of doubt should encourage you and provide hope even when it feels like there is no way out of despair, illuminating the path ahead. In times of pain and hardship, do not succumb to the paralysis of blind faith—rather, let that inner voice that dares to question, however small and faint, become an irreplaceable light that shines through the darkness, even if it is but a whisper.
Let it be a shout; simply give voice to it: "There must be another way."
Thank you.
