Hello
My name is Matthew Williams. I am the champion.
I have won medals in three sports at the national championships in Canada. In basketball, I participated in world-level matches and, honorably, represented Canada at the world championships.
(Applause) I practice basketball and speed skating five days a week, supported by top-class coaches and mental performance consultants to help me perform my best in competitions.
By the way, this is all about the Special Olympics.
Does hearing that change the way you see me and my achievements?
The world does not necessarily see people like me as champions.
Until recently, people like me were marginalized and did not appear in public.
Since the Special Olympics began in 1968, there have been significant changes, but in too many cases, people with intellectual disabilities remain invisible to the broader world.
Everyone does not think it's wrong to use derogatory terms in front of me.
They use the term "retarded" derogatorily.
They do not consider how much it hurts me and my peers.
Please do not think that I am here as an object of pity.
The reason I am here is that there are still serious issues with the public's perception of individuals with intellectual disabilities, and in fact, the problem is that in too many cases, nothing is seen at all.
Did you know that there was a world championship this year?
I was one of the 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities who gathered in Los Angeles to compete, along with participants from 165 countries.
Over 62,000 spectators watched the opening ceremony, which was broadcast live by the sports networks TSN and ESPN.
You probably didn't know about such a championship, did you?
What do you think when you see someone like me?
This is a challenge to all of you: Can you see us as equals?
The Special Olympics transforms not only the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities but also the values of everyone who witnesses it.
To explain for those who are unfamiliar, the Special Olympics is aimed at athletes with intellectual disabilities.
It is different from the Paralympics and the Olympics.
High-level sporting competitions are held throughout the year for individuals with intellectual disabilities, transforming the lives and values of those involved.
This has changed my life and the lives of many other people as well.
And the public's perception of individuals with intellectual disabilities has also changed.
I was born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability.
I played hockey from a young age until I was 12 years old.
As I grew older, it became increasingly difficult to keep up with everyone, which was frustrating and infuriating.
For a while, I was completely away from sports. I didn't have many friends, and I felt left out, which made me sad.
In the past, individuals with intellectual disabilities were hidden from society.
No one thought that I could participate in sports, let alone be a valuable member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist from the University of Toronto, researched the impact of regular exercise on the athletic abilities of children with intellectual disabilities.
The conclusion reached by Dr. Hayden and other researchers through rigorous scientific methods is this: "The low athletic abilities of children with intellectual disabilities are simply due to a lack of opportunities to participate in sports."
For individuals with intellectual disabilities, participation in exercise programs and sports competitions is beneficial.
Not many people believed in it. However, the pioneers—Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of the Special Olympics—did not give up. And the athletes have proven more than 4.5 million times that they were right.
(Applause) Before participating in the Special Olympics, I was anxious. I was young, shy, lacked confidence, and had few friends.
But when I went there, everyone encouraged and supported me, and I was able to be myself without worrying about how others saw me.
Now I am a basketball and speed skating athlete. I have participated in provincial and national championships, and this year I had the opportunity to compete in the Summer World Championships held in Los Angeles. As a member of the basketball team, I advanced to the world championships for the first time representing Canada.
(Applause) I am one of over 4.5 million athletes in the world, and I have truly heard many similar stories.
By being athletes in the Special Olympics, we reclaim our pride and dignity.
The Special Olympics also addresses important health needs for the athletes.
According to research, the average life expectancy of men with intellectual disabilities is 13 years shorter than that of non-disabled individuals, while for women, it is 20 years shorter.
However, by engaging in physical activities and participating in competitions through the Special Olympics, we can maintain our health.
Additionally, the coaching staff teaches us about nutrition and health.
The Special Olympics provides free health screenings, targeting athletes who have difficulty communicating with doctors or accessing medical care.
In the Summer World Championships of 2015, my team Canada faced the basketball team from Nigeria.
The day before the match, the Nigerian team underwent health screenings at the venue, and out of the ten members, seven received free hearing aids, allowing them to hear clearly for the first time in their lives.
(Applause) The athletes have undergone a remarkable transformation.
They were able to enjoy the game more vibrantly and play with confidence because they could now communicate with their coach in person.
Emotions were running high because they could now hear the sound of the ball, as well as the whistle and the cheers of the fans in the stands—sounds that are taken for granted by everyone.
The athletes in the Special Olympics not only during competitions
Life outside the competition arena also changes.
According to a survey released this year, nearly half of American adults reportedly do not know anyone with an intellectual disability. Among these individuals, who make up 44% of Americans, there is a very low level of acceptance towards people with disabilities, and they hold significantly negative views.
Furthermore, the prevalence of such derogatory language is evidence that individuals with intellectual disabilities remain invisible to far too many people.
People often use it casually or as a derogatory term.
The term "retard," which was tweeted over nine million times last year, is an incredibly hurtful word to me and my 4.5 million fellow athletes around the world.
Many people do not think it is insulting, but that is a mistake.
My fellow Global Messenger, John Franklin Stevens, wrote an open letter addressed to the political commentator who uses derogatory language to insult people. It says, "Please come to the Special Olympics someday."
"Please try to leave without being moved."
(Applause) At the Summer World Championships in 2015, people lined up for hours to watch the final day of the weightlifting competition.
Amidst the standing crowd, my teammate Jackie Barrett, also known as "The Moose of Newfoundland," lifted 297 kg in the deadlift and 277 kg in the squat—(applause)—significantly breaking the record at the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the record holder for weightlifting in Newfoundland, not just among Special Olympics athletes, but among all weightlifters.
In Los Angeles, he became a big star, and ESPN tweeted his new record live, moved by Jackie's performance.
Fifty years ago, hardly anyone believed that individuals with intellectual disabilities could do such things.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremony of the World Championships and to support the athletes gathered from 165 countries.
We were not hidden at all; instead, we were cheered and celebrated.
The Special Olympics teaches athletes to have confidence and pride.
It teaches society that individuals with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and acceptance.
(Applause) I now have achievements and dreams in my sport, I am blessed with wonderful coaches, I hold respect and dignity, I am healthier than before, and I aspire to become a personal trainer.
(Applause) I am no longer someone who is hidden or bullied; I am here giving a TED Talk.
(Applause) Thanks to the Special Olympics, the world has changed. However, the journey is still long.
When you next see someone with an intellectual disability, I hope you will recognize their abilities.
If you see someone using derogatory language, I hope you will inform them just how hurtful those words can be.
And I hope you will consider getting involved with the Special Olympics.
(Applause) Finally, I will say just one thing.
Nelson Mandela said, "Sports have the power to change the world."
The Special Olympics is truly changing the world, providing 4.5 million athletes with a chance to be reborn, gain confidence, make friends, experience life without prejudice, feel like champions, and actually become champions.
Thank you.
