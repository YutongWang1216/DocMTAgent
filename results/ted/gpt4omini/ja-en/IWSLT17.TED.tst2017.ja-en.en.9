I would like to ask for a show of hands: Is there anyone here who has ever unfriended someone on Facebook? It was because that person made some unpleasant comments regarding politics, religion, parenting, or food.
Is there anyone here who has at least one person they are avoiding because they don't want to talk to them?
In the past, it was sufficient to talk about the weather or health, following the words of Professor Higgins from "My Fair Lady," in order to engage in polite conversation.
Recently, topics like climate change and anti-vaccination have emerged—these are no longer safe subjects for conversation.
In the world we live in, any conversation has the potential to escalate into a dispute, politicians are unable to communicate with one another, and there are people who passionately argue for and against even the most trivial issues. It's not normal.
A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center involving 10,000 American adults revealed that people are more polarized and divided than ever in history.
No one is willing to compromise or listen.
And we make decisions based on what we already believe regarding where we live, whom we marry, and who we befriend.
This also means that no one is willing to listen.
Conversations require a balance between speaking and listening, but somewhere along the way, we have lost that balance.
The advancement of technology is also a contributing factor.
You probably still have your mobile phone in hand or within reach.
According to the Pew Research Center, one-third of teenagers send over 100 messages a day.
Most of those people probably communicate more through messaging than in face-to-face conversations.
In the magazine *The Atlantic*
There is an interesting article written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell.
He assigned a communication task to the students.
I wanted to teach them how to talk about specific topics without using notes.
He writes, "I realized—"
"I believe that the ability to converse is the most overlooked skill that teachers have failed to teach."
Students spend hours every day engaging with ideas and others through screens, but they have little opportunity to hone their interpersonal skills.
"It may sound strange, but we must ask ourselves if there is anything more important among the skills of the 21st century than the ability to converse logically and confidently."
"I make my living by speaking: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, and plumbers."
I talk to both people I like and those I don't.
Personally, I talk to people with whom I completely disagree.
"Still, I can have wonderful conversations with those people."
In the next ten minutes, I will teach you how to speak and how to listen.
You may have heard various tips about the art of conversation, such as making eye contact, thinking in advance about topics of interest, showing that you are listening attentively by maintaining eye contact, nodding, and smiling, or repeating and summarizing what the other person has said.
Please forget all of that.
It is not helpful.
There is no need to learn how to appear as if you are listening attentively if you are actually listening.
(Applause) I apply my skills as a professional interviewer in my everyday life as well.
I will teach you the techniques of interviewing, which will also help you improve your conversation skills. Please learn how to engage in conversations that do not waste each other's time, avoid boredom, and do not hurt the other person.
"Everyone has had wonderful conversations."
I know what it is like.
A conversation in which you feel truly connected with the other person, captivated and inspired, as if you have been completely understood by the time you part ways.
There is no reason for most conversations to be like that.
Let's take a look at the ten basic rules of conversation together. Mastering even one of them will allow you to enjoy better conversations.
The first rule is to avoid multitasking.
Not only should we stop playing around with our mobile phones, tablets, and car keys,
It means being fully present, both physically and mentally.
It means to be present in the moment.
Please do not think about the argument with your boss.
Please do not think about what to have for dinner.
If you want to disengage from the conversation, please feel free to do so. However, please refrain from participating only halfway.
Rule 2: "Do not speak unilaterally."
If you want to assert your opinion without any reaction, discussion, rebuttal, or opportunity for growth, then you should write a blog.
The reason I don't have people who speak dogmatically on my show is that they are boring.
If you are conservative, you dislike Obama, food stamps, and abortion.
If you are liberal, you dislike big banks, oil companies, and Dick Cheney.
It's obvious what they're going to say.
It wouldn't be surprising if it turned out that way.
You need to approach conversations with the mindset that there is always something to learn.
The famous therapist M. Scott Peck says, "To truly listen, you need to set yourself aside."
This means that sometimes it is necessary to set aside your own opinions.
"When the speaker feels accepted, they no longer feel vulnerable and begin to reveal their innermost thoughts to the listener."
Let’s approach conversations with a mindset of learning.
According to Bill Nye, "Everyone you meet knows something you don't."
I would say, "Everyone is an expert in something."
Rule 3: "Ask open-ended questions."
Let's learn from journalists.
You should start with questions that begin with "when," "where," "who," "what," "why," and "how."
Asking complex questions will only yield simple answers.
If you ask, "Were you scared?"
Responding to the most striking words in the question, in this case "Were you scared?" the answer is either "yes" or "no."
"Was he angry?" "Yes, he was very angry."
Let's allow the other person to explain, since they are the ones who know.
You should ask questions like, "What was it like?"
"How did you feel?"
By doing so, the other person will have to pause and think, and you will receive much more interesting answers in return.
The fourth point: "Go with the flow."
The thoughts that come to mind must be expressed.
You may have often heard interviews where, after the guest has spoken for several minutes, the host asks a question that is completely unrelated or has already been answered.
The host must have stopped listening two minutes ago, having come up with some clever question that they felt compelled to ask.
We are doing exactly the same thing.
I remember running into actor Hugh Jackman at a coffee shop while sitting and talking with someone.
And then they stop listening.
Thoughts and ideas come to mind, but
Let's just allow them to come and go.
The fifth point: "If you don't know, say you don't know."
People who appear on the radio, especially in the case of NPR, are aware that what they say is recorded, so they are very careful when they claim to be an expert on something or to know something for certain.
Please do the same. It's better to be overly cautious.
You should not cheapen the conversation.
Rule 6: "Do not equate the other person's experience with your own."
It is important not to bring up your own experience of losing a family member when the other person is talking about losing theirs.
It is important not to start talking about how much you dislike your job when the other person is discussing troubles at their workplace.
The experiences of the other person and your own are entirely different.
All experiences are individual.
Furthermore, it is important to recognize that you are not talking about yourself.
There is no need to demonstrate how wonderful you are or how much you are struggling in that moment.
Stephen Hawking was reportedly asked about his IQ, to which he responded, "Well, boasting about IQ is something only losers do."
Conversation is not an opportunity for self-promotion.
"How are you doing today?" "Check out my blog!" Rule 7: "Do not repeat the same thing multiple times."
It may sound patronizing and tiresome, but everyone tends to do it.
Especially in conversations at work and with children, people often change their words and repeat themselves in an attempt to prove that their assertions are correct.
Please do not do that.
Rule 8: "Do not get hung up on the details."
To be frank, the other person does not care about the details, such as years, names, or dates. You may be struggling to remember them.
The other person is not interested; what they are interested in is you.
What kind of person you are and what commonalities you share.
So let's forget the details; they are not necessary.
Rule 9: This is not the last point, but it is the most important one.
"Listening"
It is impossible to count how many great figures have emphasized this point, but listening is the most important skill that anyone can develop.
This is a quote from Buddha, slightly rephrased: "You learn nothing when your mouth is open."
The famously taciturn President Calvin Coolidge once said, "No one has ever lost their job for listening."
Why do we not try to listen to each other?
One reason is the desire to talk rather than to listen.
When you are speaking, you have the upper hand.
There is no need to ask about things that are not interesting.
Be the center of attention.
You can strengthen your identity.
However, there are other reasons as well, such as being distracted.
The average speaking speed of a normal person is 225 words per minute, but we can comprehend up to 500 words per minute.
Our consciousness attempts to fill the remaining 275 words.
It certainly takes effort and energy to pay attention to the other person, but if you cannot do that, then you are not truly having a conversation.
The two people are just shouting unrelated words at each other while being in the same place.
We must listen to each other.
The author Stephen Covey expresses this beautifully.
"Many people do not listen in order to understand."
"Many people are listening in order to respond."
There is one more rule, and that is Rule 10: "Be concise."
"My sister says, 'A good conversation is like a miniskirt: short enough to be interesting, but long enough to cover the essentials.' (Applause) Everything I have discussed so far can be summarized in one thing: 'Take an interest in the other person.'"
I grew up under the care of my very famous grandfather; it was a customary practice in my household.
Many people would come to talk with my grandparents, and after the guests left, my mother would come and ask, "Do you know who that person was?"
She became a runner-up in the Miss America pageant.
That person is the Mayor of Sacramento.
She is a Pulitzer Prize winner, and he is a Russian ballet dancer.
So I believe that everyone has something amazing hidden within them.
I have come to believe that this is what makes me a good host.
I try to keep my mouth shut as much as possible and open my heart, hoping to be impressed. I have never been disappointed in doing so.
Please do the same.
Going out, talking to people, and listening to them is important, and above all, it is essential to hope to be impressed.
Thank you for your attention.
