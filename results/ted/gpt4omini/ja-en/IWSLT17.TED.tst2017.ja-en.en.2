My hometown is the most free, tolerant, and progressive place in the United States—Seattle, Washington.
I grew up in a wonderful family of Seattleites.
My mother is an artist and my father is a university professor. I am very grateful for the environment I was raised in, as I have always been able to choose my own way of life without hesitation.
In fact, I did not follow the path that my parents had envisioned for me.
At the age of 19, I dropped out of college—whether it was a dropout or expulsion doesn't really matter.
And I began to tour all over as a professional horn player; it was something I had always dreamed of.
While performing chamber music, I toured across the United States and throughout Europe, and for several years, I collaborated with the outstanding jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd.
And by the end of my twenties, I became a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a wonderful life it is!
My parents never complained.
They have always supported me.
It wasn't their ideal, though.
I heard that he said to the neighbors and friends, "My son is in the middle of a gap year—it's been about ten years."
But— there was only one awkward conversation about my way of life, so let me tell you about it.
I was 27 years old and was back home from Barcelona during the Christmas holiday, cooking together with my mother in the kitchen, just the two of us.
My mother had become silent—too silent.
I thought something was wrong.
"When I asked, 'Mom, what are you thinking?'"
My mother said, "We are really worried about you."
"What do you mean?" I wondered what it could possibly be at this point.
"Please answer me honestly— you haven't voted for the Republican Party, have you?"
Well, the truth is, I was just a horn player who wasn't really that interested in politics.
I had come to a realization, and my parents, sensing it, were a bit taken aback.
I had become an ardent supporter of capitalism. Let me tell you how that came to be.
It stems from something I have been interested in for a long time. It may come as a surprise, but it's "poverty."
I remember seeing real poverty for the first time during my childhood in Seattle.
My family was lower-middle class, but of course, we were not in true poverty.
It was quite distant.
The first time I saw poverty and its manifestations was in the early 1970s when I was six or seven years old.
It was an ordinary experience, something that everyone has likely gone through.
It was a photograph featured in National Geographic, showing a child in East Africa about my age, with flies on their face and a swollen belly.
It was clear that there was no hope left, but there was nothing I could do.
Some of you may remember that photograph, or perhaps one similar to it.
It is a photograph that brought to the attention of Western countries the ongoing suffering caused by poverty in the world.
That image is etched in my memory; even as I grew up, attended school, dropped out, returned to my studies, and started a family, I still could not forget it.
I wondered what happened to that child.
I wonder what happened to people around the world like that child.
So I began to investigate. Although I was not in college at the time, I was searching for answers about what happened to those who were at the extreme of poverty in the world.
Did things worsen, or did they improve? What on earth happened?
And I found the answers, which changed my life. I will share that with you all.
Now then— most Americans believe that poverty has worsened. They think it has deteriorated compared to when I was a child— back in the days of that photograph.
If you were to ask Americans whether global poverty has worsened or improved, 70% would likely respond that hunger has worsened since the early 1970s.
Well then, let me tell you the truth.
The insight that changed my worldview is this.
Since 1970, the proportion of people living in hunger—those surviving on less than one dollar a day—has decreased by 80%, even after adjusting for inflation.
Compared to my childhood, the most extreme poverty in the world has decreased by 80%.
I had no idea about such things.
Everyone, this is a miracle.
It is something to celebrate.
It is the greatest achievement in human history in the fight against poverty, and it has occurred in our generation.
(Applause) When I learned this, a question arose: what enabled this achievement?
If we don't understand why it was possible, we won't be able to replicate it, will we?
To replicate this and rescue an additional 2 billion people from poverty—this is the main point, after all—since my childhood, 2 billion of our brothers and sisters, referred to as the "least of these" in the Bible, have emerged from poverty.
To rescue an additional 2 billion people, I want to know.
So I began to search for answers.
Politics had nothing to do with the answer; I couldn't care less.
I still have no interest.
I wanted the best answers from mainstream economists, regardless of whether they were right, left, or centrist.
Let me provide the answer.
The key factors for success are five.
The 2 billion of our brothers and sisters around the world who have been rescued from poverty to date.
The first is globalization.
The second is free trade.
The third is property rights.
The fourth is the rule of law.
The fifth is entrepreneurship.
Since the 1970s, the world has transitioned to a system of free enterprise, enabling various possibilities.
I'm not simple either.
I understand that free enterprise is not perfect, and I also recognize that there are other necessary elements to build a better world beyond just free enterprise.
But it's an amazing thing.
It's a matter beyond politics.
What I have learned and come to realize is
The significance of capitalism goes beyond the accumulation of wealth.
The greatest aspect of capitalism is its aspirational nature. Many people speak about aspiration from this platform, which is to say, the aspirations that arise from desire. It is deeply intertwined with the system of free enterprise.
We must spread this aspiration further.
Now, let me share the second insight, which is related to the first and brings progress not only to the world but also to this very city we are in.
Among all the words I've heard so far, the thoughts on poverty alleviation that I just shared are the most well-articulated: "There has been no system in human history that has created wealth as effectively as the free market."
"Because we have rescued billions from poverty."
Whose words are they?
It has a ring to it, like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
That's not it.
President Barack Obama.
Why can I say that so confidently?
It's because I was told directly.
You wouldn't believe it.
"What came out of my mouth was, 'Banzai!'"
In addition, I thought to myself, "What a wonderful opportunity this is!"
Do you know what I was thinking?
In May 2015, during an event on this theme at Georgetown University.
I believe this is the solution to the biggest problem facing the United States. What is it?
It is to reach out to those who need us the most under the belief that the free market can solve poverty, regardless of whether one is liberal or conservative.
You all must know without saying that the crises happening across the United States and around the world are due to political polarization.
We are now reaching a critical crisis point.
This is an unpleasant situation; this cannot be allowed.
Last year, a paper was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which is the most prestigious scientific journal published in the West.
The paper from 2014 focused on the theme of "asymmetry of political motivations."
What this means is that, according to the definition by psychologists, one’s own ideology is assumed to be born out of love, while the worldview of the enemy is presumed to arise from hatred.
It is often the case in global conflicts.
For example, this is a phenomenon observed between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the authors of this paper discovered is that today in the United States, both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party find themselves in a majority of people who have fallen into a mindset characterized by "asymmetry of political motivations."
Today in the United States, the vast majority of politically engaged individuals believe that they are motivated by love, while the opposing side is driven by hatred.
Please consider this.
The prevailing mindset among most people is this: "My ideology is based on fundamental tolerance; I want to help others, but those other people are the villains trying to undermine me."
As long as this kind of asymmetry exists, society cannot move forward.
It is impossible.
So, what is the solution?
First, let’s be honest: differences are to be expected.
Do not underestimate the differences; it’s not that simple.
There are many excellent studies on this topic.
Veteran TED speaker and friend Jonathan Haidt
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
I study the differences in ideologies, values, and moral perspectives among various people.
According to him, for example, conservatives and liberals tend to prioritize quite different things.
For example, according to Haidt, among liberals, those who care about poverty issues are 59% more numerous than those who prioritize economic freedom.
Among conservatives, those who prioritize economic freedom are 28% more numerous than those who care about poverty issues.
It seems that this gap is unlikely to close.
"Completely incompatible, you say? That's a mistake."
This is what we call diversity, and this is where our strength lies.
What is it that rescued the poor? Do you remember?
The obsession with poverty issues has spread worldwide through the means of a free economy.
In other words, we need each other if we want to rescue the next two billion people from poverty and help those in need.
There is no other way.
Now
How can we achieve this?
It's difficult, isn't it?
Innovative thinking is needed.
There are many on this stage.
Social entrepreneurship—yes, there's absolutely no doubt about it. It's the best!
Sustainable, ethical, moral, and responsible foreign investment is necessary—
Absolutely right! But what is truly necessary?
A new world with flexible ideologies.
More surprise is needed.
Isn't it?
"Have you ever felt that your ideology has become rigid?"
Isn't it a bit cliché?
"Have you ever felt that you are only listening to people who share the same opinion as you?"
Why is this dangerous?
Because when we talk about the economy in this country, on the right side there are conservatives who only discuss taxes, regulations, and big government.
On the left side, there are liberals who always discuss income inequality when talking about the economy.
Both are important things—truly important for both you and me.
When it comes to rescuing people suffering from hunger and in need of help from poverty today, this becomes a hindrance.
We should collaborate under the best methods to alleviate poverty, utilizing the highest standard tools available to us freely. This becomes possible only when conservatives recognize that liberals' commitment to addressing poverty is necessary, and liberals acknowledge that conservatives' dedication to the free market is also essential.
This diversity, if embraced, will become one of America's strengths in the future.
So, how can we achieve this together?
I need a list of activities, not just for you all, but for myself as well.
Item one— Please keep in mind that merely tolerating those with differing opinions is not enough.
That is not enough.
We must keep in mind that we need people who do not agree with us—because there are still those waiting for the tools that our diversity can provide.
So, what should we do? How should we convey this?
So, where do we begin? Here.
It is all of us in this room. We are fortunate.
We are fortunate to have people who are willing to listen.
We are fortunate to have success and leadership as well.
They may be willing to listen even if you speak about unexpected ideologies.
Progress may begin from there.
That is item one. Now, item two.
There is an ideal person that I want you to become, and that I want to become myself—especially someone who can blur the boundaries. I hope you can be someone who is ambiguous and difficult to categorize.
If they are conservatives, they should always speak of a moral obligation to fight for the poor and discuss poverty.
If they are liberals, they should always speak of the benefits of the free market when responsibly utilized to solve our problems.
In doing so, two things will be realized.
The first is that we can begin to address the relief of the next 2 billion people and engage ourselves in the necessary solutions that we have seen so much of in the past and will continue to need in the future.
The second is that we can transform the horrific and sacred ideological battles we are experiencing in this country into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
In doing so, we may realize that the significant differences we perceive are, after all, not as large as we think.
Thank you.
