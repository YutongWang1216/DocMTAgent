Have you ever heard of place names like Kenema in Sierra Leone or Alua in Nigeria?
It is the most extraordinary place for me.
In the hospitals located there, nurses, doctors, and scientists have quietly been fighting against one of humanity's most terrifying enemies, the Lassa virus, for many years.
The Lassa virus is very similar to the Ebola virus.
It causes high fever and can sometimes take lives.
However, by putting their lives at risk every day to protect the people of the community there, they are safeguarding all of us.
However, what surprised me the most when I visited there many years ago was that they began each day in the harsh frontline by singing songs.
Everyone gathers to express joy.
They show vitality.
For many years, we have been visiting each other, gathering together to sing and create songs, and it is truly enjoyable. We are not there solely for the pursuit of science, but because we connect through human love.
I think it is easy to imagine that as the situation changes, it will become something very important and indispensable.
In March 2014, everything changed significantly when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea.
This was the first outbreak in West Africa, occurring near the border between Sierra Leone and Liberia.
We are afraid—
In fact, for a while, both Lassa and Ebola were spreading more than previously thought, and we believed that they might eventually reach Kenema.
So, my team members took immediate action and joined Dr. Fuma Khan's team, where they prepared a highly sensitive viral RNA detection device to ensure that we could detect Ebola if it crossed the border and reached Sierra Leone.
Since we had already used such devices for Lassa virus countermeasures, we understood the methodology, and the team was very capable.
All they needed was to provide the tools and location for testing Ebola.
However, unfortunately, that day has come.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to the hospital's obstetrics ward, and when the team conducted tests for viral RNA, they confirmed the first case of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Sierra Leone.
Their work was truly admirable.
They immediately assessed this case, safely managed the patient, and began contact tracing to understand the situation.
This may have allowed for the early containment of the infection's spread.
However, by that day, the outbreak had already been ongoing for several months.
Hundreds of cases emerged, surpassing previous outbreaks.
By the time it reached Sierra Leone, it was no longer just a single case; it came crashing in like a tsunami.
We collaborated with the international community, the Ministry of Health, and the local authorities in Kenema to confront this infectious disease. By the following week, there were 31 cases, then 92, and finally 147 cases— all of the patients flowed into Kenema because there are only a limited number of facilities in Sierra Leone capable of handling this disease.
We did everything we could around the clock to save the patients, raise awareness, and, additionally, we carried out one simple thing.
The blood samples taken from patients to detect Ebola were, of course, discarded, which was a relief.
Instead, we inactivated the virus with chemicals, packed the blood samples into boxes, and sent them across the sea to other research facilities.
I sent them to Boston, where my team is located.
Then, they continued to work day and night, shifting shifts every day, and quickly analyzed the genomes of 99 Ebola viruses.
The genome of the virus is its blueprint.
The genome is something that everyone has.
It expresses the characteristics of everything that constitutes us and contains vast amounts of information.
The results of such work are simple yet extremely powerful.
By observing and comparing these 99 viruses with three genomes previously published from Guinea, we were able to clarify that the outbreak had begun in Guinea months earlier, first infecting humans and then spreading through human transmission.
This is very important for elucidating how to intervene. However, what follows is crucial: contact tracing.
We have confirmed that the virus is mutating as it spreads among humans.
Observing each of these mutations is extremely important because diagnostic devices, vaccines, and treatments are all fundamentally based on genomic sequences.
International health experts need to implement measures in response to this and reevaluate all the achievements made so far.
At that time, as a scientist, my work involved first accumulating data, spending months and months sequestered in the laboratory, carefully and meticulously analyzing the data, engaging in several exchanges to prepare for the publication of research papers, and finally, once the paper was published, making the data publicly available.
This is the current state of the researchers' workflow.
But you couldn't have been doing something like that, could you?
My friends were on the front lines, and it was very clear that they needed help—indeed, they needed a great deal of assistance.
Therefore, the first thing we did was to immediately publish the genome sequence on the website after it was read.
I simply sent the data out to the world and said, "Please lend us your support."
And help arrived.
I was astonished to see the data published in an instant, and messages began arriving from people all over the world.
One of the world's leading virus tracking teams suddenly joined us.
They began collaborating virtually, continuing exchanges through phone calls and emails, tracking the virus minute by minute and devising methods to contain its spread.
There are various ways to build a community in times of crisis.
Especially when the outbreak began to spread on a global scale, everyone actively sought to investigate, engage, and lend their support.
Everyone wanted to be involved.
The abilities of such people around the world are truly remarkable, and the internet connects us all.
Imagine, rather than viewing each other as threats and avoiding one another, everyone saying, "Let's do this together."
"Let's work together to solve this," they say.
The problem was that the data we were all using was very limited and insufficient, as it was only what we found through online searches.
At such times, a great many possibilities—opportunities—are lost.
At the early stages of the outbreak in Kenema, 106 medical records were collected, and it was decided to publish them to the world.
And at our research facility, we were able to demonstrate that by training a computer using those 106 cases, we could predict the prognosis of Ebola patients with an accuracy close to 100%, which we communicated to the healthcare professionals working on the ground.
We developed an app to provide support, but for that app to be sufficiently effective and to demonstrate its efficacy,
The 106 cases were far from sufficient, and we were waiting for more data to come in before the release.
However, the data did not come in easily.
Everyone was researching and thinking individually, waiting continuously, but everyone was holed up in their silos and not utilizing the power of collaboration.
But something like this—this is just unimaginable, isn't it?
Don't you think so? I'm sure everyone feels the same way.
"Our lives are at stake."
In fact, many lives were lost, including five of my dear colleagues in the medical field: Bal Fonnie, Alex Mogboi, Dr. Fuma Khan, Alice Koboma, and Mohamed Fula.
They are five among the many healthcare professionals who died in Kenema and its surroundings. At that time, while the world was waiting, we were silently working separately.
Ebola hemorrhagic fever, like other threats to humanity, is exacerbated by suspicion, backbiting, and discord.
When we build walls between each other and engage in conflict, the virus gains strength.
However, unlike other natural threats, the fight against Ebola involves us all equally.
"We are fighting together."
If someone contracts Ebola, it may quickly spread to someone else.
Right now, our lives are equally fragile, sharing a similar vitality, and possessing the same fears and hopes. In such circumstances, I hope we can come together with joy and cooperate.
One of the graduate students I mentored read a book about Sierra Leone and learned that the name of the city where our hospital is located, "Kenema," actually means "clear like a river and transparent to everyone’s eyes" in the Mende language of Sierra Leone.
I felt a very deep meaning in that, because even before knowing it, we had always respected the people of Kenema, shared information in an open environment, and made efforts to work together.
That is an important thing.
When the outbreak occurred, it was essential for us and everyone around us to share information openly without hiding anything in order to fight it together.
This is by no means the first Ebola outbreak, nor will it be the last. There are many other microbes lurking, such as the Lassa virus.
And the next time an outbreak occurs, it may arise in a large city where millions of people live.
It may be a virus that can be transmitted through the air.
The virus may be deliberately spread.
This is very frightening, of course. However, at the same time, what this experience has taught us is that we have both the technology and the capacity to overcome it. It means we can win the fight against viral infections and gain the upper hand.
"But that will only be possible as long as we unite our strengths. And let us do so with joy."
In the fight against infectious diseases, Dr. Khan and those who lost their lives on the front lines have always been with us in this battle. Let us continue this fight alongside them.
Let us illuminate the world with the cooperation of billions of warm hearts and compassion, so that we are not swayed by the destruction caused by a single virus.
Thank you.
