Food crisis
It has been in the news regularly.
What does it mean?
In the world, food is either in short supply or in excess depending on the location.
On the other hand, GMOs are saving the world.
There may be issues with GMOs as well.
Excessive agricultural runoff is polluting the oceans, introducing toxins, and reducing nutritional value.
Such things have been continuing endlessly.
I am very disappointed with today's discussions regarding the environment.
How can we find solutions through our knowledge?
Let's take a look at the food issue related to apples.
You all probably ate at least one apple last week.
How long do you think it has been since that apple was picked?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months — that is the average for apples found in American grocery stores.
I don't think there is much difference in Europe or other countries around the world either.
Apples are picked, stored in refrigerators, and the storage chambers are filled with gases for preservation. There are also records of workers who entered these storage facilities and died while trying to retrieve apples, because the air that delays the decay of apples is toxic to humans.
Why did no one know about this?
Why did I not know about this?
Ninety percent of the antioxidant components contained in apples are lost by the time they are consumed.
This is nothing more than a lump of sugar.
Why are we so lacking in information? What are the measures for improvement?
The reason is that the platform is lacking.
Speaking of platforms, when I was young, I encountered some really dangerous things on the internet.
I did it, on this platform.
However, I was also able to meet people and express myself.
What are some ways to express oneself using food?
If there is a platform, it becomes easy to ask, "What if...?"
My question was this: What if the climate were equal for everyone?
This is a climate map of the world.
Areas of high productivity are indicated in green, while areas of low productivity are shown in red.
Colors move and change. The agricultural center that was once in California has now shifted to Mexico.
China is growing better food on Brazilian land. We are subject to the climate.
What if each country had a climate suitable for production?
How will that change people's lives?
Will it change the quality of life and nutrition?
For the previous generation, the problem was obtaining more food—at a lower cost.
Welcome to the world of global farming.
Humanity has constructed a vast analog farm.
The lines depicted here represent food transportation connected by cars, airplanes, and railways.
It is miraculous that the food sustaining a population of 7 billion is produced by only a small fraction of people.
What if...
What if we could build a digital farm?
It is a digital farm that spans the globe.
What if we could take this apple, digitize it in some way, propagate it through the air as particles, and reconstruct it elsewhere?
What if...
I read the passages written here and, feeling inspired, began this research.
The first point—Japanese agriculture lacks young labor, water, land, and a future. Seeing this, I headed to Minamisoma, located just north of Fukushima, which had been affected by the disaster at that time.
Due to the contamination of the land, the children moved to Sendai and Tokyo. Japan is already relying on imports for 70% of its food.
The food crisis is not limited to Japan.
The population engaged in agriculture in America is 2%.
Regardless of the country, there is only so much that can be accomplished with just 2%.
Looking at other countries—50% of Africa's population is under the age of 18.
Eighty percent of them do not want to become farmers.
Agriculture is labor-intensive.
The lives of farmers engaged in small-scale agriculture are miserable.
They are flowing into urban areas.
In India, farmers are not even receiving supplies of water or electricity, and the number of farmers who committed suicide this year was the highest in the past decade.
It's truly an unpleasant story.
Where do farmers go?
They are in urban areas.
Young people do not stay in their hometowns; everyone is flowing into urban areas.
So, how can we build a platform that inspires young people?
Introducing the new model of tractor!
This is the combine harvester I created.
Years ago, I started going to convenience stores and DIY shops to begin crafting.
I started creating strange things. When I tried to make plants dance by connecting them to a computer, they all withered away. It was a significant number.
I finally managed to prevent them from withering.
I built one of the most intimate relationships in my life, which was the beginning of understanding the language of plants.
When I wish to grow them larger,
They said, "Go for it!"
There is only an old electrical laboratory here that no one wants to enter.
"What do you think can be done?"
I built a farm at the MIT Media Lab with my colleagues. This place has been known not for biology, but as a research institute for digital life.
In this approximately six square meters of space, enough food for 300 people is produced each month. While it may not be a large quantity...
There are many interesting technologies being utilized there, but...
What is the most interesting thing among them?
Beautiful white roots, deep green vegetables, and monthly harvests.
Is this a new type of cafeteria?
A new retail experience?
A new grocery store?
One thing is certain: this is the first instance of something being harvested from the roots at the Media Lab.
The salad is in the bag, but there are no issues at all.
However, with experts in image processing, data scientists, and robotics researchers present, what would happen if they thought, "If I use my knowledge, I can do something like this; let's give it a try," while harvesting something from the roots?
We try to keep the plants here in the lab before taking them outside because we don’t want to waste what we've grown; it’s something valuable.
My palate is particular—I will taste it myself first; I don't want anyone else to eat it until I'm sure it's decent food.
So, I eat lettuce every day, and the pH of the lettuce can be determined within a margin of error of 0.1.
"Oh, that's pH 6.1; I can't eat it today." That's how it goes.
The lettuce on that day was incredibly sweet.
When plants are exposed to stress and try to protect themselves, chemical reactions occur within them, making them very sweet. "I don't want to die."
The cries of such plants create a flavor that is very sweet and to my liking.
A scientist who shifted to plant physiology...
I thought about making it possible for others to conduct this experiment as well.
I am very curious about what will be created. So, I thought about a lab that could deliver anywhere.
First, I tried making it.
My lab is located at the front side of the Media Lab, where about 30 sensors are attached to each plant.
If you are familiar with genomics and genetic engineering, this is what is referred to as the phenotype.
It originates from the term "phenomenon."
For example, saying "I prefer strawberries from Mexico" actually means that you prefer strawberries grown in a climate that cultivates flavors to your liking.
Therefore, if we can create that climate through programming—using combinations such as the concentrations of carbon dioxide and oxygen as a recipe—we can program the flavor, nutritional content, size, shape, color, and texture of the plants.
This requires data, so we have installed many sensors to understand the situation. When you think about indoor gardening plants and look at this, it can be very saddening. "Why are you dying? Talk to me."
Farmers develop exceptional vision for predicting plant growth around their late 60s to early 70s.
When plants are wilting, they understand that the reasons might be a lack of nitrogen, a deficiency of calcium, or the need for moisture.
This exceptional vision is not passed down.
This is data that a farmer has stored in the cloud.
Tracking the temporal changes of data.
We will correlate this data with individual plants.
These represent the broccoli in the laboratory on a certain day, expressed through IP addresses.
It is broccoli that can be assigned an IP address.
(Applause) If you think there's still not enough strangeness, click here to view the plant profiles.
This is downloadable data regarding the growth of the aforementioned plants, likely exceeding your expectations, not only concerning when they can be eaten.
The timing of when one can obtain the necessary nutrients
It predicts the timing until it reaches your preferred flavor.
Are you overwatering?
Are you getting too much sunlight?
It also issues warnings.
It speaks to me. It’s intelligent. It has a language in common with me.
(Applause) I sometimes think of myself as the first user of Facebook in the plant world.
The previous one was a plant profile, and that plant begins to make friends.
They consume less nitrogen, more phosphorus, and less potassium compared to other plants.
They should be compatible. For now, I can only speculate, and I am also learning about the complexity of inter-plant relationships.
Plants may not recognize us as friends—but there is a possibility; it depends on our actions.
This is my current lab.
It is a bit more organized than before. I have experience in setting up data centers in various hospitals and have some knowledge about creating controlled environments.
Then, I am attempting various experiments in this environment.
This method, hydroponics, was developed by NASA to reduce water usage for transport to the Mir Space Station.
Here, we provide plants with exactly what they need—water, minerals, and oxygen—just the right amount.
The growth of the roots is simple; by providing just what they need, they flourish beautifully like this.
It seems as though plants have two hearts.
Because they have two hearts, they grow four or five times faster.
It is a perfect world.
Humanity has advanced technology over many years to obtain seeds that can grow in harsh environments. While technological reforms continue, new methods have now emerged. It is a perfect world.
We have cultivated various types of plants.
This variety of tomato has not been commercially produced for 150 years.
Did you know that humanity possesses a rare and ancient seed bank?
It refers to the seed bank.
It is wonderful.
There are seeds that have been preserved alive, which no one has ever tasted.
I am the only one who has eaten this tomato in the lab.
The problem is that this is a sauce tomato, and I don't know how to cook it. I tried eating the sauce tomato, but it wasn't tasty.
Using proteins, I have attempted to cultivate various things.
Humans might be able to do it too—but in reality, we are not doing it.
Now, what has become clear is that the equipment is large and extremely costly.
I intended to spread it worldwide, but it has become an apparatus that costs around 10 million yen.
It is quite difficult to find someone who can readily come up with 10 million yen, so I thought about making something smaller.
This project was actually advanced by one of my students, Camille, an undergraduate studying mechanical engineering.
Camille, my colleagues, and I conducted repeated experiments throughout the summer, aiming to create something that functions better, is more cost-effective, and can be made by anyone.
Next, I brought this to middle and high schools.
If you want to be ridiculed, try teaching something to children.
I went to the school and said, "Set the humidity to 65%."
A first-year junior high school student asks, "What is humidity?"
I answered, "It's the water in the air."
He retorts, "There's no water in the air, you know. Are you stupid?"
I also respond, "You don't have to believe me."
You don't have to believe.
"Try setting it to 100%."
He set it to 100%—what do you think happened?
Moisture condenses, forming mist, and eventually droplets of water fall down.
He said, "Oh, humidity is about rain, isn't it?"
"Why didn't you tell me that?"
We created an input screen that feels just like a game.
It's a 3D display. You can log in from anywhere in the world, and it's compatible with both smartphones and tablets.
You can operate various devices and sensors of the bot.
You can choose recipes created by other children from around the world.
When you select a recipe and activate it, seedlings will be planted.
You can make changes even during growth.
"Why do plants need CO2? Isn't it harmful? It can kill people, right?"
You might also hear phrases like this.
"If the CO2 concentration increases, plants will die."
"If the CO2 concentration decreases, plants become very vigorous."
Once the plants are harvested, a new digital recipe is completed.
It is a process of iterative design, development, and exploration.
You can download the new data on plants and the new digital recipes they have developed. And the changes—were they effective or the opposite?
Consider these to be the core components of the development process.
We will learn a lot.
This is what we call a food computer, which we used for three weeks at school.
It grows this much in three weeks.
What’s more important is that this child thought for the first time, “Can I also become a farmer?” Perhaps they even thought, “I want to become a farmer.”
Therefore, we made all the data open.
Everything is online. Let's try assembling a food computer at home.
It might be a bit difficult, but—
It's just the beginning of our endeavor, but everything is in place.
It is very important that it is easily accessible.
We will make it more accessible.
They are farmers, electricians, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, plant scientists, economists, and urban planners.
On a single platform, I will do what I am good at.
This lab has become cramped.
This is the new facility that I have just started using.
Such warehouses can be found everywhere.
That is the reason it was chosen.
We are trying to create something like this in the warehouse.
This already exists.
Please take a look.
This also already exists.
They are cultivating green vegetables and the Ebola vaccine.
One reason these plants won in the Grand Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is that they were ahead in Ebola research. This is wonderful.
This plant produces proteins that are resistant to Ebola.
From pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements to lettuce.
It is nothing like lettuce, but this is exactly the field I am researching.
It is different in every way.
We are still in an early chaotic state—just like "this is our black box—" "Buy mine."
"No way, I hold very valuable intellectual property."
"His is no good; buy mine."
In reality, we have only just begun, and society is in the process of changing.
While seeking more affordable food, there is also a growing demand for higher-quality, environmentally friendly products.
The fact that McDonald's has disclosed the contents of chicken nuggets, which have always been regarded as the most suspicious food, indicates that they are adapting their marketing to align with changes in society.
Let's take a look at the modern world.
The personal food computer, food server, and food data center will operate as an open phenome.
Unlike an open genome, ours is like a wiki with a bit of a climate recipe added. You can select from a dropdown menu to activate it and grow plants.
How does this endeavor appear on a global scale?
Do you remember that the world was connected by lines?
First, we will install the oscillator.
Instead of sending the food itself, we will begin disseminating information about food.
It is not merely my fantasy; it is already being disseminated in places like this.
The food computer, food server, and food data center will also be established, allowing people to connect through the sharing of information.
The future of food supply is not about fighting the inherent flaws.
I understand what the flaws are.
The future of food supply is about a network that connects the next billion farmers, enabling the raising of issues and providing solutions through the offering of platforms. "What if..."
Thank you very much.
