At times, I feel very ashamed of being a European.
Over the past year, more than one million people have sought help and arrived in Europe. Frankly speaking, our response has been inadequate.
It is truly full of contradictions.
The tragic death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi was mourned by everyone; however, since then, over 200 children have continued to drown in the Mediterranean Sea one after another.
While acknowledging the division of responsibilities for accepting refugees in international agreements, we turn a blind eye to the fact that the number of refugees accepted by the small country of Lebanon exceeds the total number across Europe.
While we lament the existence of smuggling boats, we have turned them into the only route for asylum to Europe.
Despite a shortage of labor, we are excluding individuals who meet our economic and demographic needs from acceptance.
While advocating for liberalism in opposition to Islamic fundamentalism, we simultaneously implement oppressive policies that detain young asylum seekers, separate children from their families, and confiscate the belongings of refugees.
Don't you think it's strange?
Why have we come to adopt such inhumane responses to this humanitarian crisis?
I do not believe it is because people are indifferent; at least, I do not want to believe that is the reason.
I believe it is due to a lack of vision among politicians—a vision to adapt the international refugee policies established over 50 years ago to the changing era of globalization.
Therefore, I would like to return to the basics and pose two very fundamental questions—questions that we all should consider.
First, why is the current system not functioning?
And how can we fix this?
The modern refugee system was established by these individuals immediately after World War II.
The original purpose is to provide people with a destination when their state collapses or, in the worst-case scenario, when the government turns against its citizens, and to ensure they have a safe place to live with dignity until their return.
It was created in preparation for situations like the one we see in Syria today.
It is an international agreement signed by the governments of 147 countries—committing to mutual acceptance of refugees within their own territories through the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). This pertains to the acceptance of individuals fleeing conflict and persecution.
However, today this system is not functioning.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum, but
In reality, our immigration policies are blocking the path to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek integration in their host countries and eventually return to their homeland, but
In reality, it has become a state of being almost eternally stalled.
In theory, refugees are to be shared among countries around the world.
In reality, due to geographical issues, countries neighboring conflict zones are taking in the overwhelming majority of refugees from around the world.
The reason the system is not functioning is not because the rules are flawed.
It is because the rules are not being properly applied to fit the changing world, and that is where we need to reconsider.
Here, what the current refugee system actually entails is
Let me explain a little.
However, I will explain from the perspective of the refugees, rather than from a top-down viewpoint of the system.
First, imagine a Syrian woman.
Let's call her Amira.
She is a woman who symbolizes many people in that region.
Amira is a woman with children, like 25% of the world's refugees. The reason she cannot return home is that the city she lived in is in this condition. As you can see, Amira's city, Homs, was once a beautiful and historic city, but now it is buried in rubble.
It is not a situation in which she can return.
However, Amira has no path to resettlement in a third country, as it is akin to winning the lottery, with only 1% of refugees worldwide able to achieve it.
Therefore, Amira and her family are faced with almost impossible choices.
There are only three basic options.
The first option is to enter a refugee camp with the family.
There, while they may receive assistance, Amira and her family's future is virtually non-existent.
Refugee camps are desolate wastelands—many are located in the desert.
At the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, the sound of gunfire can be heard at night near the border with Syria.
There are constraints on economic activities.
The quality of education is also poor.
And among the refugees currently housed in camps worldwide, about 80% will endure such conditions for at least five years.
Life there is miserable. Perhaps that is why only 9% of Syrians actually choose this path.
Next, there is the option of aiming for the city, such as Amman or Beirut in neighboring countries.
This is the option chosen by 75% of Syrian refugees.
However, they also face significant difficulties there.
Refugees typically do not have the right to work in these urban areas.
Assistance is hardly received at all.
In this case, after Amira and her family have exhausted their savings, they are left with almost nothing, and a life of poverty in the city awaits them.
The third option—more Syrians are choosing this.
This is a phenomenon observed today in Europe, where individuals risk their lives on perilous journeys in search of a handful of hope for their families, aiming for other countries.
Such unreasonable choices are being imposed on refugees worldwide, limiting their options to three: camp confinement, urban poverty, and dangerous journeys.
For refugees, this is precisely what the international refugee system itself represents.
But believing that this is the only option is an illusion.
I believe there is room for reconsideration.
The reason these options are limited is that in our minds, we believe that refugees have no other paths to choose from, but that is incorrect.
Politicians view the refugee issue as a "zero-sum" problem—meaning that any action taken for the benefit of refugees is perceived as a burden on citizens.
We tend to assume, as a common premise, that refugees are a burden or a strain on society.
On the contrary, there are ways in which refugees can contribute to society.
What I want to say is that there are ways to broaden the choices available to refugees while also benefiting everyone—host countries, communities, our society, and the refugees themselves.
I believe that the way we think about refugees can be fundamentally changed through the four methods I am about to discuss.
There is one common point among all four methods: they utilize the opportunities created by globalization, mobility, and markets, which is to change our perspective on the refugee issue.
The first idea is the development of an environment for refugees. It starts with a very basic recognition: refugees are human beings just like everyone else, placed in an extraordinary situation.
I began a study in Uganda with colleagues from the University of Oxford to investigate the economic activities of refugees.
The reason I chose Uganda is not because it is a leading host country in the world.
This is because they have adopted an excellent policy.
Unlike other host countries around the world, Uganda has provided refugees with economic opportunities.
It granted refugees the right to work and the freedom of movement.
This has led to astonishing results for both refugees and the areas where they reside.
In the capital city of Kampala, 21% of refugees own businesses and employ workers, with 40% of those employed being citizens of the host country.
In other words, refugees were creating jobs and employing citizens of the host country.
Even within the refugee camps, there were remarkable examples of vibrant individual enterprises.
For example, in the refugee settlement known as Nakivale, Congolese refugees are engaged in the business of buying and selling digital music.
A business started by a Rwandan refugee involved providing computer games for young people using refurbished gaming consoles and televisions.
Despite the harsh environment, innovative initiatives are being carried out. This photo is of Demouke, a Congolese individual.
When I arrived at the settlement, I was almost penniless, but I aspired to be a filmmaker.
He established a community radio station with friends and colleagues and is now engaged in video production, having borrowed a video camera.
I have co-produced two documentary films at the request of my team, successfully establishing a business with minimal capital.
We should determine our response to refugees by referring to such examples.
We need to provide opportunities for refugees to thrive as human beings, rather than viewing them as necessarily dependent on humanitarian aid.
Of course, clothing, bedding, sleeping arrangements, and food are all essential in emergencies, but we need to look beyond that.
opportunities such as communication, electricity, education, the right to work, and access to capital and banking.
We must provide opportunities for refugees to benefit from the global economy, just as it is taken for granted for us. This is something that should be possible for refugees as well.
The second idea pertains to economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all countries that accept refugees in the world adopt policies like those of Uganda.
Most countries do not welcome refugees into their economies in the same way as Uganda.
However, there are viable practical proposals available.
In April of last year, I went to Jordan with my colleague, development economist Paul Collier. During my stay, we engaged in brainstorming sessions and discussions with the international community and the Jordanian government, focusing on approaches aligned with Jordan's domestic development strategy.
We devised a method to provide jobs for Syrians, exploring the potential for refugee employment in economic zones alongside the employment of the Jordanian people.
Just 15 minutes from the Zaatari refugee camp, which is home to 83,000 refugees, lies the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area.
The Jordanian government has invested over one million dollars to connect this area to the power supply and road networks, but two essential elements are lacking: labor force and domestic investment.
What if refugees could work here? What if they could support their families, acquire skills through vocational training, and eventually return to Syria instead of being trapped in camps?
I believed this would be beneficial for Jordan, as the development strategy for Jordan as a middle-income country requires the advancement of domestic manufacturing.
It is beneficial not only for refugees but also contributes to the reconstruction of Syria after the conflict. Ultimately, they will become the best human resources for rebuilding Syria—this is based on the recognition that the protection and training of refugees is essential.
The proposal was published in the political journal *Foreign Affairs*.
Catching the attention of King Abdullah.
Two weeks ago, at the Syria Support Conference held in London, it was announced that a pilot program would be implemented this summer.
(Applause) The third idea I would like to propose is a matching system between the country and refugees. This is something that can lead to happy outcomes like the one in this photo, where a Syrian refugee is taking a selfie with Chancellor Angela Merkel.
It's rare to ask refugees about their hopes and where they want to go, isn't it? However, it is possible for everyone to benefit while listening to the voices of refugees.
The concept of matching theory, developed by economist Alvin Roth, determines the final combinations based on the preferences of the parties involved.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Taitelboim explored how to apply this concept to refugees. They asked refugees to list their preferred host countries in order of preference, while simultaneously having the host countries prioritize the types of refugees they wish to accept based on criteria such as job skills and language. This method aims to match both parties effectively.
Now, of course, while factors such as diversity and vulnerability should also be considered in the conditions for acceptance quotas, they can be regarded as methods to enhance the matching rate.
The concept of matching is effectively utilized, for example, in university admissions for students and in matching kidney donors with patients. It is also incorporated into algorithms used by dating sites.
How about incorporating this to expand the options available to refugees?
It can also be applied on a national scale. One of the significant challenges we face is convincing local communities to accept refugees.
Currently, for example, in my country, the United Kingdom, we often engage in the ridiculous practice of sending engineers to the countryside and farmers to the city.
By conducting market matching, we can align the preferences of both parties and gather the needs and requests from both the host community and the refugees.
And the fourth idea is humanitarian visas.
Most of the tragedies and chaos occurring in Europe are entirely avoidable.
The fundamental contradictions in Europe's refugee regulations are the cause of this situation. What this means is that in order to become an asylum seeker in Europe, one must embark on that perilous journey and arrive without any prior preparation. But why is such a journey necessary?
In an era where budget airlines and consular services are readily available, such journeys should be entirely unnecessary; however, last year, over 3,000 people lost their lives in this manner, at the borders of Europe and within Europe itself.
It's a simple matter: if refugees were allowed to travel to Europe normally and seek asylum, many tragedies could be avoided. The means to achieve this is through what is called humanitarian visas, which can be obtained at embassies or consulates in neighboring countries. Then, they could simply cover their own travel expenses and journey to Europe by ferry or airplane.
Using smugglers to cross from Turkey to the Greek islands costs 1,000 euros.
A budget airline ticket from Bodrum to Frankfurt costs 200 euros.
There are significant advantages to freeing refugees to have such options.
Many lives could be saved, the human smuggling industry would be rendered obsolete, and the chaos from Europe’s frontlines, such as the Greek islands, would dissipate.
What is hindering such measures is not rational strategies, but rather the policies themselves.
This idea is actually being implemented.
Brazil took the lead in adopting this approach, allowing over 2,000 Syrians to obtain humanitarian visas and enter Brazil, and upon arrival, they immediately gained refugee status.
All Syrians who utilized this system have obtained refugee status and received formal refugee recognition.
There are historical precedents as well.
Between 1922 and 1942, 450,000 Assyrians, Turks, and Chechens used the Nansen Passport as an international identification document to move within Europe and apply for asylum in other countries across Europe.
The Nansen International Office for Refugees was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, recognizing this pragmatic strategy in the world.
The four ideas I just mentioned are all ways to expand the options available to the hypothetical refugee, Amira, introduced at the beginning.
This is a way to broaden the options available to refugees, allowing us to move beyond the three unreasonable choices I mentioned earlier, while also benefiting others in the process.
In conclusion, we urgently need a new vision that understands how to expand the options available to refugees without them being a burden.
The notion that refugees are inevitably a burden is incorrect.
While it is a humanitarian obligation, refugees are individuals with skills, talents, and the willingness to contribute. Given the opportunity, they possess the capacity to make significant contributions to society.
In the coming era, there will be no end to the movement of people across the globe.
What is happening in Europe will continue for many years to come.
Refugees will continue to move and wander in search of a place to belong. We should explore rational and pragmatic methods to address this situation—not relying on outdated theories of humanitarian aid or the concept of charity, but rather utilizing the opportunities created by globalization, market dynamics, and mobility.
I want to appeal to all of you, as well as to the politicians, to wake up and confront this issue head-on.
Thank you.
