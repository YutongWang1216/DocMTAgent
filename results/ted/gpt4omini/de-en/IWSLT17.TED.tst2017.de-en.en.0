That is James Risen.
You may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.
Long before anyone had ever heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he dramatically revealed that the NSA had illegally tapped the phones of Americans.
However, it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.
In it, he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed over designs for an atomic bomb to Iran.
If that sounds crazy, read it.
It is an incredible story.
But do you know who didn't like that chapter at all?
of the U.S. government.
For nearly 10 years, the government investigated Risen and demanded that he reveal his alleged sources.
In this context, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of prosecuting whistleblowers and spying on journalists.
According to the First Amendment, the media has the right to publish confidential information.
But it is impossible to exercise this right when the media do not receive this information and when they cannot protect the identity of the brave individuals who disclose it.
So when the government came knocking on Risen, he did something that many brave reporters had done before him: he refused and stated that he would rather go to prison.
From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.
But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.
Suddenly, although they had claimed for years that it was essential for their case, the government's demands on Risen were dropped.
The reason: In the age of electronic surveillance, reporters and sources can hide less and less.
Instead of failing and forcing Risen to testify, his digital footprints could also take care of that for him.
And so the investigators secretly obtained his phone records without his consent,
just like his email data, financial and banking information, his credit report, and even travel records with the list of his flights.
Amidst this information, they found evidence that they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's alleged source.
Unfortunately, this is just one of many cases.
President Obama promised upon taking office to protect whistleblowers. But instead, the Justice Department has prosecuted more than all previous U.S. administrations combined.
Now you can imagine how that can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as secret.
Since September 11, almost every article about national security has been the result of a whistleblower approaching a journalist.
We are therefore jeopardizing the press work that is supposed to be protected by the First Amendment, because the government has increasing means to spy on everyone.
But just as technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technology to better protect its sources.
And they can do so from the moment they make contact, rather than afterwards, in the witness stand.
Today, there is communication software that did not exist when Risen wrote his book, and it is significantly more secure than regular emails or phone calls.
One such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source submission system for whistleblowers that was originally developed by the late internet activist Aaron Swartz, and has since been further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work.
Instead of sending an email, you go to a messaging website, like the one here from the Washington Post.
There, you can upload documents or send information, just like with any ordinary contact form.
These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.
Therefore, the government can no longer secretly obtain information, and many of the details it would request would not be available from the outset.
SecureDrop is just a small part of the whole effort to protect press freedom in the 21st century.
Unfortunately, governments around the world are continually developing new spying technologies that endanger us all.
It is up to us to ensure that not only technology experts like Edward Snowden have a way to expose wrongdoing. It is equally important that we protect the next whistleblower,
who knows about the grievances in the care of soldiers and wants to report on overcrowded hospitals. Or the next environmental worker who raises the alarm about the contaminated water in Flint. Or a Wall Street insider who warns us about the next financial crisis.
After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect the constitutional rights of us all.
Thank you.
