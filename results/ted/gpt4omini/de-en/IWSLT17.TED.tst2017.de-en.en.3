What do you think when you look at me?
A believer? An expert?
Perhaps even a sister.
Or suppressed, subjected to brainwashing, a terrorist?
Or simply a delay at the airport security check.
That is actually true.
I do not blame you for your negative impressions.
This is how the media portray people who look like me.
A study found that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.
Studies show: Americans believe that most would not know any Muslims.
Presumably, people do not talk to their Uber drivers.
For all those who have never met a Muslim: It is great to meet you.
I will tell you who I am.
I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with extra cream.
I am introverted.
a wannabe fitness fanatic,
and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim woman.
But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born that way.
I have made that decision.
When I was 17 years old, I made the decision to come out.
No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim woman. I chose to wear the hijab, my headscarf.
My feminist friends were appalled: "Why are you suppressing yourself?"
The funny thing was: At that time, it was actually a declaration of feminist independence for me, in response to the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old to conform to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.
I did not just passively adopt my parents' faith.
I have wrestled with the Quran.
I read it, reflected, questioned, doubted, and ultimately believed.
My relationship with God was not love at first sight.
It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with each reading of the Quran.
The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.
I recognize myself in that. I feel that God knows me.
Have you ever felt that someone perceives you, understands you completely, and yet somehow loves you?
That's how it feels.
Later, I got married and, like all good Egyptians, began my career as an engineer.
Later, after my marriage, I had a child and essentially lived the "Egyptian-American Dream."
Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.
Many of you likely remember exactly where you were.
I was sitting in my kitchen, had finished breakfast, looked at the screen, and saw the words "Breaking News."
There was smoke, airplanes were flying into buildings, people were jumping out of the buildings.
What was that?
An accident?
A technical malfunction?
My shock quickly turned into outrage.
Why would one do something like that?
I switched the television channel and heard: "... Muslim terrorists ...," "... in the name of Islam ...," "... of Middle Eastern descent ...," "... jihad ...," "... bombed Mecca!"
Oh, my God.
Not only has my country been attacked, but in an instant, the actions of others transformed me from a citizen into a suspect.
On the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start my graduate studies.
I remember how, as we drove in silence, I huddled down as low as I could in my seat, and for the first time, I was afraid of being recognized as a Muslim woman.
We moved into our apartment that night, in a new city that felt like a completely different world.
And then I heard, saw, and read the warnings from national Islamic organizations that said: "Be vigilant," "Be cautious," "Stay in well-lit areas," "Do not gather."
I stayed inside all week.
Then it became Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.
And again the warnings were: "Do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a target."
I watched the extensive coverage.
The feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard about attacks on Muslims or on people who were mistaken for Muslims, being dragged out and beaten.
There were indeed arson attacks on mosques.
I thought: We should stay at home.
But something didn't feel right.
Because the people who had attacked this country attacked our country.
I bore the brunt of people's anger towards the terrorists.
Imagine! I was angry too.
It is not easy to constantly have to explain myself.
I have nothing against questions; I love questions.
It is the accusations that are harsh.
Nowadays, we can actually hear people saying, "There is a problem in this country -- it's called Muslims."
"When will we get rid of them?"
Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.
They speak of my community as if it were a tumor in the body of the USA.
The only question is: Are we malignant or benign?
They know: a malignant tumor is removed entirely, while a benign tumor is merely monitored.
The alternatives are meaningless because the question is framed incorrectly.
Muslims are, like all other Americans, not a tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.
Thank you!
Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.
Will closing mosques make America safer?
It may free up a few parking spaces, but it won't stop the terror.
Regular attendance at a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other faiths and fosters greater civic engagement.
And as a police chief in the Washington, DC area recently told me: People are actually not radicalized in mosques.
They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.
In the process of radicalization, it has been found that it begins online. First, the individual is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremist group can brainwash them into believing that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or has fallen away from the faith.
If we want to prevent radicalization, we need to encourage people to attend the mosque.
Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.
Finally, a group like ISIS justifies its brutality with the Quran.
As a Muslim woman, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we must do everything we can to stop a group like ISIS.
But we would fit into their worldview if they were recognized as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.
Thank you!
ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan does with Christianity.
Both groups claim their ideology is based on their "Holy Book."
But when one looks at them, it is not what they read in their "Holy Scripture" that drives them.
It is their brutality that leads them to read these things into the scripture.
A prominent imam recently told me an amazing story:
A girl came to him because she intended to join ISIS.
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.
He said the problem was exactly the opposite. Every cleric she had spoken to silenced her and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only get her into trouble.
Inspired by nothing and lacking something that would give meaning to her anger, she became a primary target for manipulation by extremists who promised her a solution.
This imam restored the connection to God and her community.
Instead of blaming her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for real change in the world.
What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining ISIS.
That was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.
But how does it affect ordinary Americans?
How does it affect everyone else?
How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy, our freedom of thought?
A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: When we are afraid, at least three things happen.
We are more likely to accept an authoritarian government system, conformity, and prejudice.
A study shows that when test subjects are presented with news reports that negatively portray Muslims, they are more likely to agree with military attacks on Muslim countries and the curtailment of the rights of American Muslims.
This is not just an academic problem.
If you look at when the sentiment against Muslims surged—between 2001 and 2013—it happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.
It happened in the lead-up to the Iraq War and during two election periods.
So, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I had expected.
It can indeed be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well-informed citizens.
The treatment of Muslims is an early warning sign.
We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.
The assignment of collective guilt is not just about having to explain oneself.
Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both attended school.
Deah was an athlete.
He was at the dental school, talented, promising...
His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.
She visited him there and he showed her his resume. She was astonished and said:
"When did my little brother become such a skilled young man?"
Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, as well as Yusor's sister, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon. He did it in their apartment, as if it were an execution, after posting anti-Muslim statements on his Facebook page.
He shot Deah eight times.
Fanaticism can be not only immoral but also deadly.
So, back to the beginning.
What happened after 9/11?
Did we go to the mosque or stay safely at home?
We discussed it, and for us, it was not an easy decision, as it was about what kind of America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can practice our religion freely.
We chose the mosque.
With our son in the car seat, we drove silently, with urgency, to the mosque.
I took him out, took off my shoes, entered the prayer hall, and what I saw made me stop.
The hall was completely filled.
Then the imam made an announcement, expressed his gratitude, and welcomed our guests, as half of those gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers, and non-believers who had come not to attack us, but to stand by us.
At that moment, I broke down.
These people were there because they had chosen courage and compassion over panic and prejudice.
What will you choose?
What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?
Will you play it safe?
Or will you join those who say: We are better than them?
Thank you.
Thank you!
Helen Walters: So Dalia, you seem to have struck a chord.
But I wonder, what do you say to those who might claim that you are giving a TED Talk, that you are a deep thinker working in a prestigious think tank, and thus an exception rather than the rule?
What would you say to those people?
Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be mistaken. I am completely normal.
I am not an exception.
My story is not unusual.
I am as ordinary as it gets.
When looking at Muslims around the world, and I did so with the largest study ever conducted on Muslims globally, people want normal things.
They want prosperity for their families, they want jobs, and they want to live in peace.
So I am in no way an exception.
When people appear as an exception to the rule, it is often the rule that has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.
HW: Thank you. Dalia Mogahed.
