On April 3, 2016, the largest data leak in history was published. The "Panama Papers" reveal that the rich and powerful have hidden enormous sums of money in tax havens. What does this mean? We asked Robert Palmer from Global Witness for an explanation. This week, we were informed about a leak of 11 million documents from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.
The publication of these documents provides a small glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.
We get an impression of how clients, banks, and lawyers approach firms like Mossack Fonseca and say, "Okay, we need an anonymous company. Can you set that up?"
We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, how it operates.
This has already led to some very direct consequences.
The islands' Prime Minister has resigned.
There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has shell companies in tax havens.
It is claimed that a trail of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, through a close childhood friend, a famous cellist.
Now there will be a lot of rich people and others out there who are nervously awaiting the next release and the next revealed documents.
Now it sounds like the plot of a spy thriller or a John Grisham novel.
It seems far removed from you, me, ordinary people.
Why should that concern us?
But the truth is: When the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and do not pay all their taxes, it means less money for important public services like healthcare, education, and roads.
And that concerns us all.
For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.
Around the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by a select few to hide and obscure their wealthâ€”something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.
I think many people find this whole world very confusing, and it is difficult to understand how these tax havens operate.
I always imagine it like a Matryoshka doll.
So, you have a company within another company, within yet another company, which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these structures.
It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society, to truly understand what is going on.
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the United States.
Presumably because there have been no prominent Americans involved in these revelations, this scandal.
Now, it is not that there are no wealthy Americans hiding their assets in tax havens.
But due to the principle by which these tax havens operate, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American clients.
If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming, or Nevada, we would see many more cases and examples with connections to the United States.
In fact, it is the case that in some U.S. states, less information is required, less information must be provided, to establish a company than to obtain a library card.
This kind of opacity in the United States has allowed employees of school districts to rip off schoolchildren.
It has allowed fraudsters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.
It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.
Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out what all of this looks like in practice.
How does that actually work?
So we sent an undercover investigator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.
Our investigator posed as an African minister looking to bring suspicious money into the United States to purchase a house, a yacht, and a private jet.
We were truly shocked that all but one lawyer made suggestions to our investigator on how he could transfer his money.
These were all preliminary discussions. None of these lawyers accepted us as clients, and of course, no money was exchanged. But it highlights the problem with this system.
It is also important not to view this as isolated incidents.
It's not about an individual lawyer who made suggestions to our undercover investigator.
It's not about an individual high-ranking politician involved in a scandal.
It's about how the system operates that establishes corruption, tax evasion, poverty, and instability.
And to address this, we need to change the rules of the game.
We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.
That may all sound very gloomy, as if we could do nothing about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there would always be the wealthy and powerful.
But as a born optimist, I do see that some things have begun to change.
In the last few years, we have seen advances towards greater transparency regarding the ownership of companies.
The issue gained political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.
Since then, the EU has been recording in central registers at the national level who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them.
One of the unpleasant truths is that the United States is lagging behind in this regard.
Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both chambers of parliament, but it is not making the progress we would like to see.
We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this massive insight into the world of tax havens, are used as a means to promote greater transparency in the United States and globally.
For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.
We need ordinary people to get angry when they see how others can hide their true identity behind shell companies.
We need business leaders to stand up and say, "Lack of transparency is not good for business."
We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and commit to ending this kind of opacity through legislation.
Together, we can finally put an end to the opacity that currently enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption, and money laundering.
