Most people have probably never heard of Roy Price, even though he is likely responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.
Likely also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.
This goes back to the decision that Roy made three years ago.
Roy Price is an executive at Amazon Studios,
the TV production company of Amazon.
He is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog hairstyle, and describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, tech, tacos."
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce.
Of course, this is a very competitive industry.
There are already so many TV series that Roy can't just select any of them.
He has to find shows that are very, very good.
In other words, he has to find shows that are located far to the right on this curve.
This curve represents the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. The ratings range from 1 to 10, and the height indicates how many shows received that rating.
If your show is rated nine or higher, it is a winner.
Then you have a successful show.
These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" – all the shows that are addictive, where after watching a season, your brain asks, "Where can I find more of these episodes?"
This kind of show.
On the left side, here at this end, are shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" – that should tell you enough about what’s going on at this end of the curve.
Roy Price doesn’t worry about ending up on the left side of the curve, because I believe it takes a special kind of intelligence to outdo "Toddlers and Tiaras."
He is more concerned about the average bulge, the average television – the shows that are neither good nor bad; they simply do not engage.
So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.
The pressure is on, and of course, this is also the first time that Amazon is doing something like this, so Roy Price wants to take no risks.
He wants to create successes.
He needs guaranteed success, so he is holding a competition.
He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates through an evaluation process, then produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where everyone can watch them for free.
And when Amazon releases things for free, people do grab them, right?
Millions of viewers watch these episodes.
However, they do not know that they are being watched while watching these shows.
They are being watched by Roy and his team, who are recording everything.
They track when viewers start the show, when they pause, which parts they skip or watch again.
They collect millions of data points to decide which show they should produce using this information.
In fact, they collect the data, process it, and from this, the answer emerges, which is: "Amazon should create a sitcom about four Republican U.S. Senators."
They made this show.
Does anyone know the name of this show?
Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't very good.
It’s just an average show – in the truest sense of the word – as the average of this curve is 7.4 and "Alpha House" lands at 7.5 – so just above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team were aiming for.
Around the same time at another company, another manager placed a top show through data analysis. His name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the Chief Content Officer of Netflix. Just like Roy, he is always on the lookout for that one super show, and he also uses data for it, but he goes about it a bit differently.
Instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on Netflix viewers, such as the ratings they give to shows, their viewing habits, which shows they like, etc.
Then they use this data to uncover those little details about the viewers: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.
Once they had all the pieces together, they took a risk and decided to create not a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about one senator.
Do you know this show?
Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix scored a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.
"House of Cards" receives a rating of 9.1 on this curve. So exactly where they wanted to be.
Of course, the question now is: What happened here?
You have two very competitive, data-savvy companies.
They connect all this data together, and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.
What is the reason for that?
Because the logic somehow suggests that this should work for everything.
If you collect millions of data points for a decision you are making, then you should be able to make a good decision.
You have 200 years of statistics as backup.
You optimize it using very powerful computers.
The least you can expect is good television, right?
If data analysis doesn't work this way, then that's somewhat alarming, because we live in a time when we increasingly rely on statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond just television.
Does anyone here know the company Multi-Health Systems?
No one. Okay, that's even good.
Multi-Health Systems is a software company, and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. If you do come into contact with it, you're in prison.
If someone here in the USA is in prison and requests release, it is likely that the data analysis from this company will be used to determine whether a release will occur or not.
Just like at Amazon and Netflix. But instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, the decision is made about whether a person will be good or bad.
Mediocre television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.
Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the vast amount of data,
does not always produce the best results. This is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.
Even the most data-savvy companies can be wrong at times.
Yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes.
In 2009, Google announced that they could predict outbreaks of influenza, the severe kind, through data analysis of Google searches.
It worked wonderfully and was a major news sensation. The success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."
It worked perfectly, year after year after year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,
and no one could say why.
It simply didn't work; this was once again a sensation, including the retraction of the publication in the magazine "Nature."
Even the most data-savvy companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.
Despite all these errors, data is increasingly flowing into decisions of life—at the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine.
So we should rather ensure that data is helpful.
I too am familiar with many difficulties regarding data. I work in computer-assisted genetics—a field where some very smart people utilize unimaginably large amounts of data to make serious decisions, such as the choice of a cancer treatment.
or the development of a medication. Over the years, I have recognized some patterns regarding the difference between successful decisions based on data and unsuccessful decisions. This pattern should be shared widely.
If you ever need to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:
First, you break this problem down into its components so that you can analyze the individual parts; second, you reassemble the components to make a decision.
Sometimes you have to do this multiple times, but it always comes down to two things: breaking it apart and putting it back together.
And now the most important thing: Data and data analysis are only good for the first part.
Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to break down a problem and understand its components.
They are not suitable for putting the parts back together and then coming to a conclusion.
For that, there is another tool, and we all possess it: our brain.
If there is one thing the brain excels at, it is putting parts and pieces back together, even when the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision—especially when it is the brain of an expert.
That's why I believe Netflix was so successful: because they utilized data and reasoning where they rightfully belong in the process.
They use data to better understand their audience, which they would not have been able to do otherwise. But the decision of how to take all those parts, put them back together, and create a show like "House of Cards," that was not in the data.
Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for the show, which meant that they were taking a significant personal risk with this choice.
Amazon, on the other hand, did this the wrong way.
They used data to guide all their decisions, first when they competed for TV ideas, then when they selected "Alpha House" as a show.
It was a safe decision because they could always say, "The data tells us so."
It did not lead to the desired outcome.
Data is helpful for making better decisions, but I believe things go awry when data starts to drive our decisions.
No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and to not forget that, this device is quite useful.
Many of you will ...
Before there was data, this was the tool for decision-making.
Many know it.
It is also called the "Magic 8 Ball." It is amazing. For decisions using a yes or no question, you only need to shake the ball to get an answer. "Most likely" -- right here in this moment.
I will settle it later with a tech demo.
I have made some decisions in my life so far, and in hindsight, I should have listened to the ball.
But, as you surely know, when you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, like data analysis, to make better decisions.
But this does not change the fundamental structure.
Thus, perhaps the ball becomes smarter and smarter and smarter. Ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.
And I find this to be very encouraging news that, despite the large amount of data, it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do, and to take risks.
For in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that determine whether you land at the right end of the curve.
Thank you very much.
