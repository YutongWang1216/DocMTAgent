1.3 billion years ago, in a very distant galaxy, two black holes orbited each other ever more rapidly, converting the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.
For this brief moment, they shone brighter than all the stars combined in all the galaxies of the entire known universe.
It was a very loud bang.
However, they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we are after all talking about black holes.
The entire energy was released into the fabric of space-time itself, and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.
Let's first place the events in chronological order.
1.3 billion years ago, multicellular life had just emerged on Earth.
Since then, Earth has produced quite a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans, and — God help us — even the Internet.
About 25 years ago, a group of particularly brave individuals — Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne, and Ronald Drever from Caltech — decided to build a massive laser detector to search for gravitational waves generated by colliding black holes.
Most considered them crazy.
But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so the US National Science Foundation funded their idea.
After decades of development, construction, design, and an immense amount of hard work, they built the detector LIGO: the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.
Subsequently, the precision of LIGO was significantly increased, which greatly improved its detection capability.
Therefore, it is now called Advanced LIGO.
In early September 2015, LIGO was launched for a final test run to resolve some minor, persistent issues.
On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the detector was commissioned, the gravitational waves from the two colliding black holes rushed through the Earth.
They went through you and me.
and also through the detector.
Scott Hughes: Only two moments in my life were more emotional than this one:
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell to my terminally ill father.
In essence, those were the fruits of my life's work.
All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: This is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, a theoretical physicist at MIT. He has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their measurable signals through observatories like LIGO for 23 years. But what are gravitational waves?
A gravitational wave is a ripple in the fabric of space and time.
As the wave passes by, space and all its contents are stretched in one direction and compressed in the other.
To illustrate, instructors in relativity theory courses often perform a really silly dance.
"Stretching and compressing, stretching and compressing."
The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.
On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and compressed upon the arrival of the waves. The stretch of an average person was 10 to the power of -21.
That means 20 zeros after the decimal point, followed by a 1. That's why the LIGO staff were declared crazy.
With a five-kilometer-long laser detector, which is already absurd, this length would need to be measured to less than one-thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. That is grotesque.
At the end of his classical text on gravitation
Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGO, described the hunt for the waves as follows: "The technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous."
But physicists are resourceful, and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome.
Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.
Back to LIGO. Scott likes to claim that LIGO is more of an ear than an eye.
I would like to explain what this means.
Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the objects around us: facial features, the size of your phone.
This is quite practical. For this way, you can create an image or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from multiple points around you.
With sounds, it is different.
Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.
That's why it is very difficult, actually impossible, to create an image of things that mean a lot to you:
the face of your child, for example.
Instead, we listen for specific characteristics such as pitch and tone, rhythm, and volume, to infer the story behind it.
"Now Alice is speaking."
"And Bob interrupts her."
"Stupid Bob."
The same is true for gravitational waves.
We cannot create simple images of objects in space with them.
But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.
At least for LIGO, the measured frequencies are within the audible range.
If we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.
Listening to gravity can tell us a great deal about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has been studying for a long time.
SH: Two non-rotating black holes simply chirp: whoop!
If the two bodies are spinning very quickly, you hear the same chirp with an additional change in pitch. It sounds like this: woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!
It is a kind of vocabulary of motion, imprinted in the waveform.
On September 14, 2015 — a date that at least I will never forget — LIGO heard the following: [buzzing sound] Someone who knows what to listen for recognizes this as the sound of — SH: ... two black holes each with 30 solar masses spinning roughly as fast as the blades of your mixer.
AA: Let's briefly consider what this means.
Two black holes, the densest objects in the universe, one with a mass of 29 suns and the other with a mass of 36 suns, orbit each other a hundred times per second before they collide.
Imagine these forces.
Fantastic.
And we know this because we have heard it.
This is the lasting significance of LIGO.
LIGO paves an entirely new way for exploring the universe, as it has never been possible before.
In this way, we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.
Much in the universe we cannot see -- practically or fundamentally.
A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massive stars explode in supernovae.
They are very useful. We have learned a lot about the universe from them.
The exciting physical processes, however, occur in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon, and silicon.
We will never see through them, as they are opaque.
Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. The Big Bang: I would love to explore the first moments of the universe, but we will never see them, as the Big Bang is obscured by its own afterglow.
With the help of gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.
And perhaps most importantly: I am optimistic that there are things in the universe that we have never seen, that we will likely never see, and of which we have no conception. Things that we can only discover by listening.
Indeed, LIGO found things we did not expect right from the very first attempt.
My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says on this topic: ME: The kind of stars that produce black holes, as observed by LIGO, are the dinosaurs of the universe.
They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. The black holes are, so to speak, the dinosaur bones for our archaeological work.
LIGO provides us with a completely different perspective on events in the universe, on the formation of stars, and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos.
AA: The challenge now is to be as bold as possible.
Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirps of the cosmos.
We need ideas for new observatories — a completely new generation of observatories on Earth and in the universe.
For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?
Now is the time for great dreams.
Dream with us.
Thank you.
