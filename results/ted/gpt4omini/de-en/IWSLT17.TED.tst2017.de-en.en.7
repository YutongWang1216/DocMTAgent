I am a neurosurgeon.
Like most of my colleagues, I deal with human tragedies every day.
I know how your life can change in an instant, after a severe stroke or a car accident.
For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other organs in the body, has a very limited ability to heal itself.
After a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.
That is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.
What is a functional neurosurgeon?
A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical measures.
Surely you have heard of one of the most well-known methods, "deep brain stimulation." In this procedure, an electrode is implanted deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons in such a way that neurological function improves.
It is truly an amazing technology. It has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered from severe tremors and intense pain.
Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.
The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.
In my opinion, we are getting closer to this dream.
I want to show you that we are very close.
With a little help, the brain can help itself.
The story began 15 years ago.
At that time, I was the chief senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.
I often treated patients with traumatic brain injury.
You have to imagine that with traumatic brain injuries, the brain swells and the intracranial pressure increases.
To save a life, one must reduce the intracranial pressure.
To achieve this, it is sometimes necessary to remove a portion of the swollen brain tissue.
Instead of discarding the swollen brain tissue, we decided, along with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues who is a biologist, to analyze the brain tissue.
What do I mean by that?
We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.
This is not an easy task.
Growing cells from a piece of tissue is comparable to very young children being taken away from their families.
One must find the right nutrition, temperature, humidity, and environments to allow them to thrive.
Exactly what we had to do with these cells.
After many attempts, Jean-François succeeded.
He saw that under his microscope.
That was a great surprise for us.
Why?
It looked just like a stem cell culture, with large green cells surrounded by small, immature cells.
Perhaps you remember from biology class that stem cells are immature cells that can transform into any cell type of the organism.
The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. They are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.
It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass during surgery.
We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active—they divide very quickly.
They never die; they are immortal.
But these cells behaved differently.
They divided slowly, and after a few weeks, they even died.
We observed a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.
It took us a long time to understand where they came from.
They originate from these cells.
These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.
We all have them in our brains.
They make up 4% of our cortical cells.
They play a very important role in our development.
In the fetal stage, they are responsible for the folding of the brain.
But why do they remain with us?
We do not know that.
We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries.
That is, however, not so certain.
One thing is clear, however -- we obtained our stem cells from these cells.
We are faced with a potential cell source that enables brain healing.
We had to prove that.
So we decided to develop an experiment.
We wanted to extract a piece of brain tissue from the non-verbal area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.
and then color them to be able to track them in the brain.
In the final step, we reimplanted them at the extraction site of the same individual.
We call this autologous transplantation -- autotransplantation.
One of our first questions was: What happens when we reimplant these cells into normal brain tissue? And what will happen if we reimplant the same cells into damaged brain tissue?
Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.
In the first scenario, we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they completely disappeared, as if they had been taken out again, going back home. The space is already occupied; they are not needed there, so they vanish.
In the second scenario, we introduced an injury and reimplanted exactly the same cells, and now the cells were preserved—they grew into mature neurons.
Here you can see what we were able to observe under the microscope.
These are the cells that were reimplanted.
The evidence they show consists of these small dots. These are the cells that we stained in vitro, in culture.
Here, of course, we could not stop.
Do these cells also help a monkey recover from a brain injury?
So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.
They had to take food pellets from a tray.
They did very well at it.
Once they had reached a stable level of dexterity, we injured the hand motor area in the motor cortex.
As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed; they could no longer move their hand.
Just as would happen in humans, they recovered spontaneously to a certain extent, just like after a stroke.
The patients are paralyzed, and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. They recover to a certain extent, just like in the monkeys.
Once we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.
On the left side, you see the monkey that recovered spontaneously.
He can achieve about 40% to 50% of his original performance from before the injury.
He is not as precise and not as fast.
Now see, as we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the reimplantation.
I can tell you, those were very exciting results for us as well.
Since that time, we have learned much more about these cells.
We can freeze them and use them later.
We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.
But our dream is still to implant them in humans.
I truly hope that I can show you soon how the human brain provides us with the means to heal itself.
Thank you very much.
Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that is wonderful, I am sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, are thinking, "I know someone who could benefit from this."
I definitely.
Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials in humans.
Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are the authorities. Based on these great results, one has to fill out about two kilograms of paperwork and forms to get through this type of study.
BG: That is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.
JB: Yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience, and an almost professional team.
BG: Looking to the future -- you have completed the research and are trying to obtain permission to start the clinical trials. If you look further ahead, how many years will it take before someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available?
JB: That is hard to say.
Initially, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.
Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?
Then you have to conduct this study with a small group of patients.
It takes a long time to select the patients, to carry out the treatments, and to assess whether it is beneficial to conduct this type of treatment.
Afterwards, it must be applied to a multicenter study.
You must first really demonstrate that it is beneficial before you can offer this treatment to everyone.
BG: And that it is safe, of course. JB: Of course.
BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit to TED and for sharing this with us.
BG: Thank you very much.
