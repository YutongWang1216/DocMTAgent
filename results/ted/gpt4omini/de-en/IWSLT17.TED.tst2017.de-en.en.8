Democracy.
We in the West are making a big mistake by taking them for granted.
We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it really is, but rather as an inventory of our society.
We tend to see them as an unchangeable fact.
We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.
That is not true.
Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have undoubtedly proven that it is indeed possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.
In fact, democracy is dwindling among us, in Europe.
At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was made unmistakably clear to me as the Finance Minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs that were implemented in Greece.
At that moment, I thought that there could hardly be a better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it were to change anything.
At this point, I would like to present to you an economic model for a true democracy.
I ask you, together with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup are under the delusion that we could do without democracy, but rather that we need a true and resilient democracy.
For without democracy, our societies become meaner, our future bleak, and our great new technologies wasted.
Regarding the issue of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.
I call it the "Twin Summit Paradox."
A summit is familiar to you. You know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe, and the entire world.
We all recognize the mountain of debt,
but only a few recognize its twin.
A mountain of unused cash, owned by wealthy savers and corporations, who are too fearful to invest it where it would be productive and could generate income to pay down the mountain of debt and also produce all the things humanity urgently needs, such as "green" energy.
I will provide them with two figures.
In the past three months, a total of 3.4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the USA, England, and the Eurozone in all the wealth-generating goods, such as industrial facilities, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on and so forth.
3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the 5.1 trillion US dollars that were sitting idle in the same countries and our financial institutions at the same time, doing absolutely nothing except inflating the stock markets and driving up real estate prices.
Thus, debt and unproductive capital form the Twin Summits, which cannot be balanced out by the usual market mechanisms.
The result is stagnant wages, with more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds in the USA, Japan, and Europe unemployed, and consequently low aggregate demand, which, like in a vicious cycle, exacerbates investor pessimism, who, fearing low demand, perpetuate it by not investing. Just like Oedipus's father, who, out of fear that the oracle's prophecy might come true—that his son would kill him when he grew up,
unintentionally brings about the circumstances that lead Oedipus to kill him.
That is my struggle with capitalism --
his exceedingly wasteful manner. All this unproductive capital should be utilized to improve our lives, to further develop human talents, and especially to finance all the technologies—"green" technologies—that are crucial for saving the Earth.
Is democracy the solution?
I believe so. But before we continue: What do we understand by democracy?
Aristotle defined democracy as the form of government in which the free and the poor, as the majority, control the government.
The Athenian democracy, of course, excluded too many --
Women, foreigners, and of course, slaves.
However, it would be a mistake to diminish the significance of Athenian democracy due to these exclusions.
The crucial aspect of Athenian democracy was and is that it included the working poor, granting them not only the right to free expression but, more importantly and decisively, the right to political participation with equal voting weight in matters of state affairs.
The Athenian democracy, however, did not last long --
like a candle that shines very brightly, it also burns out quickly.
However, our contemporary liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,
but in the Magna Carta, in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and even in the American Constitution.
While Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and empowered the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately served as a charter for the rulers.
For liberal democracy only emerged when a complete separation of politics and economics became possible, and the democratic process was confined to politics, while the economy — that is, the world of corporations — became a zone free of democracy.
In our modern democracies, since the moment this separation of politics and economics began, an unrelenting struggle has ensued between the two, with the economy gradually undermining and disempowering politics.
Do you wonder why politicians are not like they used to be?
It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.
It is because one can be in government today and still not be in power, as power has shifted from politics to economics, and the two realms are separate.
I mentioned my struggle with capitalism.
If you think about it, it's somewhat like a herd of predators that has so sustainably decimated the animals it feeds on that in the end, it starves as a result.
Similarly, the economy has cannibalized politics to such an extent that it is harming itself through the self-inflicted economic crisis. The power of corporations is growing, political goods are being devalued, inequality is rising, aggregate demand is falling, and the executives of these corporations are too frightened to invest their companies' cash.
The more successful capitalism is at driving the "Demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the Twin Summits will rise, and the greater the waste of human labor and the wealth of humanity will be.
If that is true, it is clear that we must bring politics and the economy back together, and it would be better if the "Demos" retains control, just like in ancient Athens, aside from the exclusion of slaves, women, and foreigners.
This is, by the way, not a new idea.
The Marxist left had this idea a hundred years ago, and it did not turn out very well.
The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position like that in ancient Athens through a miracle, without creating new forms of brutality and waste.
But there is a solution: abolish the working poor!
Capitalism does this by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.
The problem is that as long as the economy and politics remain separate realms, automation will raise the Twin Summits higher, elevate waste, and deepen social conflicts, just as I believe it will soon happen in countries like China.
We must therefore reshape the economy and reunite the realms of economics and politics, ensuring that we democratize this reunited domain; otherwise, we will end up in a pathological surveillance hyper-autocracy that makes the film "The Matrix" seem like a documentary.
The question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism will be replaced by a dystopia similar to that in "The Matrix," or by something resembling the society in "Star Trek," where machines serve humanity and people devote their energy to exploring the universe, or by a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian "Agora," indulging in long conversations about the meaning of life.
I believe we must be optimistic.
What would it take, then, and what might it look like to have this "Star Trek"-like utopia instead of a "Matrix"-like dystopia?
In practical terms, I would like to briefly mention a few examples to you.
In the realm of companies: Please imagine a capital market where you earn money while you work, and where your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to another, and the company -- no matter which one you are currently working for -- is owned by those who are currently employed there.
Then all income would come from capital and revenues, and the concept of wage labor would be completely outdated.
No more distinction between those who own the companies but do not work in them, and employees who work there but do not own the company. No more tug-of-war between capital and labor, no more significant gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately, no more towering Twin Summits.
In the realm of global political economy: Please briefly imagine that our national currencies have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, within a universal, global digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of Twenty], in the interest of all humanity.
Imagine further that all world trade is conducted in this currency — let’s call it "the Cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" — and each government contributes the amount corresponding to its trade deficit or trade surplus to a common fund.
Imagine also that this fund invests in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world where investment capital is scarce.
This is not a new idea.
It is essentially what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.
The problem was that at the time, there were not the technical means to implement it.
Today we have it, particularly against the backdrop of a reunited politics and economy.
The world I am describing to you is simultaneously libertarian, in that it favors privileged individuals, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian.
But above all else, it is a world in which we can envision a real democracy.
Will we awaken in such a world?
or will we sink into a "Matrix"-like dystopia?
The answer depends on how we collectively make political choices.
It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Yanis ...
You describe yourself in your biography as a libertarian Marxist.
How relevant is Marx's analysis today?
Yanis Varoufakis: If anything I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.
The reason for the reunification of politics and economics is ... If we do not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall economic demand, which Larry Summers refers to as "secular stagnation."
By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also those countries where the interest in liberal democracy is low.
If this analysis is correct, then Marx is indeed relevant,
just like Hayek, which is why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and for that reason, I am also completely confused.
BG: Indeed, and now we are likely that as well.
YV: If one is not confused, one is not thinking deeply enough.
BG: That is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: Actually, it was Einstein who said that. BG: In your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China, and yesterday at the speakers' dinner, you clearly stated what you think of the West's perspective on China.
Would you like to repeat it here?
YV: There is a great deal of hypocrisy.
In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.
As I mentioned in my lecture, we have confined democracy to politics, while the area where most of the action takes place—the realm of economics—is a completely democracy-free zone.
In a certain sense, if I may say so provocatively, China today resembles England in the 19th century.
For we—remember—tend to associate liberalism with democracy—that is a mistake, historically speaking.
Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly skeptical regarding democratic development.
What one can observe now in China closely resembles the development we had in England during the Industrial Revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second.
To accuse China of doing what the West itself did in the 19th century reeks of hypocrisy.
BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year.
YV: I suspected that this was coming.
BG: Yes ...
How do you reflect on the first half of the year six months later?
YV: Very exciting, from a personal perspective, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a fresh start with the Eurozone,
not only Greece, but the Eurozone,
namely to bid farewell to complacency and the persistent denial that a massive fault line has run through the Eurozone, and continues to do so, threatening the development of the entire European Union significantly.
We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first proposal that revealed this denial --
to do it right. Unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the Eurogroup, have continued to choose denial.
But you know what comes next.
That is the experience from the Soviet Union --
If one attempts to sustain an unviable economic system through political will and authoritarianism, it may be possible to delay the inevitable for a while, but when change does occur, it happens abruptly and destructively.
BG: What change do you foresee?
YV: There is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.
BG: Did you make any mistakes during your time as Finance Minister?
YV: Every day.
BG: For example?  YV: Anyone who looks back -- Seriously...
If there is a Finance Minister, or any minister, who claims after six months in office, especially in such a tense situation, that he has made no mistakes, then that is a dangerous person.
Of course, I made mistakes.
The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.
I believed that there was a genuine interest on the part of the creditors to find a common solution.
But that did not exist.
They only wanted to bring down our government simply because they did not want to deal with the fault lines that ran through the Eurozone.
They did not want to admit that they had been implementing a disastrous program in Greece for five years.
We lost a third of our nominal GDP.
It's worse than during the "Great Depression."
None of the Troika of lenders who imposed this policy on us admitted: "That was a colossal mistake."
BG: Despite all of this, and despite the aggressive tone of the discussions, you still seem to be quite pro-European.
YV: Absolutely.
My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from someone who lives in and loves Europe.
My greatest fear is that the Eurozone will not survive.
For if it does not survive, the unleashed centrifugal forces will be demonic and will destroy the European Union.
This will not only have catastrophic consequences for Europe, but for the entire global economy.
We are probably the strongest economy in the world.
If we allow ourselves to embark on the path of a postmodern 1930, as it seems to me, it will be equally detrimental for the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.
BG: We sincerely hope that you are wrong on this point.
Yanis, thank you very much for being at TED.
YV: Thank you.
