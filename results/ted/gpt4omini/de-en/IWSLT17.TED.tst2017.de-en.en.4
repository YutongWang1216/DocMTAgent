What started as a platform for hobbyists is on the verge of becoming a billion-dollar business.
Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film, and journalism: These are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. This is made possible in research institutions worldwide.
Before air parcel delivery entered our societal consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines constructed a six-meter-high tower made of 1,500 bricks live in front of an audience at the FRAC Centre in France. A few years ago, they began flying with ropes.
By tying together, flying devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.
They can also independently construct load-bearing structures.
They have learned to carry loads, cope with turbulence, and generally respond to the laws of nature.
Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.
Our goal is to push the boundaries of what is possible in autonomous flight.
For a system to function autonomously, it must collectively be aware of where the mobile objects are located in space.
In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to locate objects. This allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.
For today's demos, we are using a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a spin-off of our laboratory.
There are no external cameras.
Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine its position in space; onboard calculations determine what the machine should do.
External commands exist at the highest level, e.g. "take off" and "land."
This is a so-called rear starter,
a flying device that tries to hit two birds with one stone.
Like other fixed-wing aircraft, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.
In contrast to most fixed-wing aircraft, it can hover, providing significant advantages during takeoff and landing, and it is very versatile.
However, there is always a downside.
A limitation of tail-sitters is that they are sensitive to turbulence, such as gusts of wind.
We are developing new controls and algorithms to enhance this.
The idea behind it is that the aircraft can regain the optimal position regardless of its orientation, and performance can be improved through practice.
Okay.
During our research, we often pose fundamental abstract questions that get to the heart of the matter.
One such question would be: What is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?
There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.
Helicopters are known to be machines with a thousand moving parts that come together to injure you.
Decades ago, trained pilots could fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a tail rudder.
Recently, we discovered that flying with just one works.
This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-controlled flying device. It was invented recently.
It has only one moving part, a propeller,
no flaps, hinges, or ailerons, no additional actuators or control surfaces, just a propeller.
Although it is mechanically simple, a lot happens inside to ensure it can fly stably and move anywhere in space.
Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starter. To get it flying, I have to throw it just right.
The likelihood of throwing it just right while everyone is watching me is low, so I will show you a video that was filmed last night.
If the Monospinner is an exercise in simplicity, this machine here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, is an exercise in abundance.
What to do with all this abundance?
You can see that it is extremely symmetrical.
Therefore, it is ambivalent in its orientation.
This grants it the extraordinary ability,
to move in all directions in space, regardless of which way it is turned or even how it is rotating.
Of course, it is complex, primarily in terms of the interactive flows from the eight propellers.
Some aspects can be represented in models, while the rest is learned directly during flight.
Let's take a look at this.
If flying machines are to become part of our daily lives, they must become extremely safe and reliable.
This machine here consists of two separate dual-propeller flying devices.
This rotates clockwise.
and the other rotates counterclockwise.
When assembled, they behave like a high-performance quadcopter.
However, if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly, albeit in a limited capacity.
We will demonstrate this now by making one half incapable of flight.
The final demonstration examines synthetic swarms.
The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.
We took commercially available micro quadcopters—each weighing less than a slice of bread—and equipped them with localization technology and algorithms.
Each unit knows where it is in space and is self-directed. Therefore, there is no upper limit.
Hopefully, these demonstrations will inspire you to come up with new revolutionary ideas.
The particularly safe machine over there wants to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.
Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.
For types like us, the reward lies in development and the act of creation.
It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, intelligent beings to shape it in such spectacular ways.
The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.
Thank you very much.
