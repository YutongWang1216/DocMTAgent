This is the story of how I almost got kidnapped and ended up in the trunk of a red Mazda.
One day after I completed my design studies, I held a yard sale.
A guy in a red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.
He bought one of my artworks.
He was alone in the city and was on a road trip across the country. After that, he would join the Peace Corps.
I invited him for a beer. He excitedly told me how he wanted to change the world.
It got late. I became tired.
While we were paying the bill, I made the mistake of asking him, "Where are you sleeping tonight?"
He made the whole situation even worse: "I don't know yet."
And I thought, "Oh, man!"
What am I supposed to do now?
Who doesn't know the situation?
Do I have to offer a place to sleep now?
But I just met him! He says he would join the Peace Corps, but I don’t really know if he plans to do that. I don’t want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazda!
That's a small trunk!
Then I heard myself say: "I have an air mattress. You can sleep in my living room."
A voice in my head said, "Uh, excuse me?"
At night, I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling and thinking, "Oh, man! What have I gotten myself into?"
A complete stranger is sleeping in my living room.
What if he’s crazy?
I was so scared that I got out of bed, tiptoed to the door, and locked my bedroom door.
But he wasn't crazy at all.
We are still in contact.
The artwork he bought from me now hangs in his classroom. He is now a teacher.
That was my first experience as a host. It completely changed my perspective.
Maybe the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends just waiting to be discovered?
Hosting people on my air mattress became normal for me. When I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with me.
Let's make a time jump, two years later...
I'm unemployed, nearly broke, my roommate is moving out, and the rent is going up.
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. All the hotels were fully booked.
I believe creativity can transform fear into fun.
I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I've been thinking about how we could earn some extra money. Our apartment will become a designer bed-and-breakfast. Young designers can stay with us, with Wi-Fi and a desk included, along with a mattress and breakfast every morning.
Ha!
We created a website and thus founded "Air Mattress and Breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].
Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on the air mattress on the wooden floor for 20 dollars.
They thought it was great, and so did we.
I am sure our cheese and ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.
We toured the whole city with them. As we said goodbye to our last guest and the door clicked shut, Brian and I stared at each other.
Had we just discovered that we could make new friends while also paying our rent?
Things started to roll.
My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.
We wanted to find out if it could be turned into a business concept.
So we presented ourselves to the investors: "We want to create a website where people can publicly post pictures of their private spaces, their bedrooms, their bathrooms—the kind of rooms whose doors you close when company is over."
Through the internet, they can invite complete strangers to stay with them.
"That's going to be the next big thing!"
We waited for the rocket to ignite.
But she didn’t.
No one in their right mind would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in other people's apartments.
Why?
Because we all learned as children that strangers are dangerous.
When faced with a problem, one reflects on the things they are good at. We could design.
At the Academy of Arts, we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel—it is the overall experience.
We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.
Can design achieve something like that?
Is it possible to create trust through design?
I would like to give you a taste of the degree of trust we were striving for.
It is a 30-second experiment. It will force you out of your comfort zone.
Thumbs up if you are ready.
Take your phone in your hand.
Now I would like you to unlock your phone.
Give your unlocked phone to the person sitting to your left.
This subtle hint of panic that you are feeling right now is exactly what hosts experience when they open the door for the first time.
For the only thing more personal than your phone is your home.
Visitors can not only read your texts, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your bathroom.
What does it feel like to hold the unlocked phone of a stranger in your hands?
Most feel the responsibility.
This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.
Only for this reason can our company exist.
Just out of curiosity, who actually has Al Gore's phone now?
Could you please announce on Twitter that he is running for the office of President?
You can return the phones now.
You have now experienced the kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.
What if we had changed a small detail in this experiment?
What if your neighbor had first introduced himself by name; if he had told where he comes from, what his dog or his children are called?
Imagine you had 150 reviews, all saying: "He can really hold unlocked phones very well!"
How would you feel if you had to hand over your phone?
For a well-thought-out feedback system significantly strengthens trust.
At the beginning, we still made some mistakes.
It was difficult for people to leave negative reviews.
Ultimately, we decided to wait until both the host and the guest had submitted their reviews before we posted them online.
Last week, we discovered something new.
We conducted a study with Stanford. We examined how likely people are to trust one another, depending on how similar they are in terms of age and place of residence.
Little surprise, we trust the people who are most similar to us the most.
The more differences we find, the less we trust.
This is a natural social bias.
It becomes exciting when you add a person's reputation -- in our case through reviews.
If you have fewer than three reviews, nothing changes.
However, if you have more than ten, everything changes.
A good reputation outweighs similarities.
The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.
Furthermore, we learned that trust depends on how much one reveals about oneself.
Here you can see the reactions to the first message from a guest.
If you say too little, like "Hi!", you're less likely to get a response.
If you share too much, like "I have problems with my mother," your request is also less likely to be accepted.
There is therefore an optimal degree of openness, for example, "Great artworks in your apartment! I'm on vacation with my family."
How can design achieve this degree of openness?
We use the size of the text box to recommend the right amount of text. We also provide tips on what topics to write about.
Our entire company is built on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.
What we didn't anticipate was the large number of people who were more than willing to set aside these prejudices.
Here you can see how many people are taking advantage of our offer.
One can recognize three things.
First: an incredible amount of luck.
Secondly: the tireless work of our team.
Thirdly: a need that had not been met before.
For us, business is going very well right now.
Of course, there are also times when not everything goes smoothly.
There were guests who threw unauthorized parties or vandalized apartments.
Hosts have left guests out in the rain.
At the beginning of the project, I worked in customer service. All calls came directly to my phone.
I was on the front lines when trust was broken.
There is nothing worse than those calls. It already hurts just to think about it.
The disappointment that one hears in the voices of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue improving.
Fortunately, out of the 123 million booked overnight stays, only a fraction encountered any issues.
For people rightly trusted one another.
When trust works, wonderful things can emerge.
One of our guests was on vacation in Uruguay. There, he suffered a heart attack.
His host drove him to the hospital.
He even donated blood for the necessary operation!
Here is his review:
"Perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sedentary activities."
The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.
Javier and Alejandra are true guardian angels who can save your life, even though they don't really know you.
They drive you in their own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you undergo bypass surgery.
Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring over books.
They even let you stay longer without charging for the extra nights.
"I can only recommend it!"
Not every stay, of course, goes like this.
But these relationships behind the mere monetary transaction are exactly what the sharing economy aims to achieve.
When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:
How does the concept of sharing fit in with monetary transactions?
This is about an economic transaction.
But simply calling it the "rental industry" now does not do it justice.
The sharing economy describes a transaction that promises human relationships.
People reveal a part of themselves, and that changes everything.
When traveling these days, it's comparable to fast food. It's efficient and reliable, but consequently less authentic.
But what if traveling were a rich buffet of local experiences?
What if, at every place you visit, a group of locals would be waiting to thoroughly indulge you and show you neighborhoods you've never heard of on a pub crawl?
or if one could learn to cook from a five-star chef?
Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.
What if we designed apartments from the ground up for sharing with one another?
What would that look like?
What if cities embraced the idea of sharing together?
I envision cities that enable us to have companionship and relationships, rather than loneliness and isolation.
In the capital of South Korea, Seoul, this project has already begun. Many parking spaces owned by the government,
were now offered to residents. Students who were looking for a place to stay,
were allocated to people whose children had moved out. Incubator programs were launched,
to finance new start-ups in the sharing economy. On our platform alone, tonight 785,000 people in 191 countries will be guests at a stranger's home or hosts themselves.
The idea doesn’t seem as crazy as we were taught.
We haven't reinvented the wheel.
Hospitality existed before as well.
There were already similar websites before us.
So why did ours work?
Aside from luck and timing, we realized that one can find the right design with the components of trust.
Design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudices.
I find that astonishing,
truly overwhelming.
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me.
We know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem.
But if it could help us, if it had such a significant impact, I wonder what we can use design for next.
Thank you.
