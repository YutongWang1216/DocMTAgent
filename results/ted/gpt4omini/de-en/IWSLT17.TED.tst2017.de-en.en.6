Some time ago, I conducted an experiment.
For one year, I would say "Yes!" to everything I was afraid of.
Regardless of whether it made me nervous or put me in uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say "Yes."
Did I want to speak in public?
No, but yes!
Did I want to be live on television?
No, but yes!
Did I want to start acting?
No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.
And a crazy thing happened: Doing exactly what I was afraid of eliminated my fear.
My fear of giving speeches, my social anxiety -- poof, gone.
The power of a word is impressive.
"Yes" changed my life.
"Yes" changed me.
But there was a particular "Yes" that profoundly changed my life in an unexpected way. It began with a question from my youngest.
I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett, and Emerson. And Emerson, the youngest, inexplicably calls everyone "sweetheart."
as if she were a waitress from the South.
"Sweetheart, I need milk for my sippy cup."
She once asked me if I could play with her when I was just about to leave. And I said, "Yes."
This "Yes" was the beginning.
a new mindset in my family. From then on, I vowed to always play with them whenever they asked me to. No matter what I was doing or where I was going, I always said "Yes" — every single time.
Almost. I'm not perfect, but I try very hard.
It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.
But it also has a surprising side effect: Only recently did I fully understand that saying "Yes" to playing with my children saved my career.
I have a real dream job.
I am an author. I come up with ideas and bring them to life.
Dream job.
No.
I am a titan.
Dream job.
I create television. I produce television.
I create television, on a grand scale.
In this TV season, I am responsible for delivering 70 hours of programming to the world.
Four television programs, 70 hours of television. Three to four shows are in production simultaneously.
Each show offers hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.
The budget for an episode of a television network can range from three to six million dollars.
Let's say five.
A new episode every nine days times four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars of television, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows that are in production simultaneously, times four, 16 episodes simultaneously: 24 episodes: Grey's, 21 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: How To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: The Catch, 70 hours of television,
350 million dollars for a season.
In America, my television series air consecutively on Thursday evenings.
Around the world, my series air in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.
My mind is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are shows that I have created myself, not just produced, so that's an added bonus. I need to find time, truly quiet, creative time, to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.
Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four shows in production at the same time, 350 million dollars, campfires burning around the world.
Do you know who else does that?
No one, that's why I am a titan.
Dream job.
I don’t want to impress you with that.
I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" comes up.
I say this so that all of you who work so hard—whether you lead a company, a country, a classroom, a business, or a household—take me seriously when I talk about work, so that you understand that I’m not just typing away on the computer and daydreaming, and it’s true when I say: I understand that a dream job is not about dreaming.
It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat—no tears.
I work a lot, hard, and I love it.
When I am immersed in work, there is no other feeling.
My work always creates a land out of nothing.
It is as if I were positioning troops, as if I were painting on a canvas.
It's as if one were hitting a high note, running a marathon.
One feels like Beyoncé.
And all of that at the same time.
I love to work.
She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinical and maternal, cruel and sensible. And the best part is the hum.
There is such a change in me when work is going well.
A hum begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the hum sounds like a bustling street; I could drive on it forever.
Many people assume that when I explain the hum to them, I am talking about writing, that writing brings me joy.
Don't get me wrong, it does.
But the hum—when I started in television production, when I began to work and work and create, to build, to collaborate, I discovered this thing, this hum, this energy. The hum!
The hum is more than writing.
The hum is action and activity. The hum is a drug.
The hum is music. The hum is light and air.
The hum is God's voice in my ear.
And when you have such a hum, you can't help but strive for greatness.
The feeling of being unable to do anything but strive for greatness, no matter the cost.
That is called the hum.
Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.
Perhaps it means genius.
Perhaps it means ego.
Perhaps it is the fear of failure.
I don't know.
I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the hum.
I just want to tell you, I am a titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.
To clarify: the more successful I become, the more shows, the more episodes, the more boundaries I overcome, the more work there is, the more things happening at once, the more people are watching me, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.
The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.
And what did I say about work?
I love work, don't I?
The land I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high pitch, the hum, the hum, the hum.
I like this hum. I love the hum.
I need the hum. I am the hum.
Am I just this hum?
And then the hum stopped.
Overworked, overstretched, exaggerated, burnt out.
The hum stopped.
Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is a total work titan.
Harper tells people, "My mom won't be there, but you can write to my nanny."
And Emerson says, "Sweetie, I want to go to Shonda-land."
They are the children of a titan.
They are baby titans.
They were 12, 3, and 1 when the hum stopped.
The hum of the engine fell silent.
I no longer loved my work. The engine was off.
The hum did not return.
My hum was broken.
I did the same things as always: the same titan work, 15-hour days, working weekends, no regrets, delegating nothing, a titan does not sleep, does not give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.
But there was no hum.
There was silence within me.
Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.
Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect titan.
I was a model titan,
Everything was gray; I simply wasn't having fun anymore.
And that was my life.
Everything I did.
I was the hum, and the hum was me.
So what does one do when what they do, the work they love, suddenly fades?
I know some may think, "Cry it out, stupid author titan."
But you know, you do it, one does, one works, one loves what one does, to be a teacher, to be a banker, to be a mother, to be a painter, to be Bill Gates, one simply loves another, and that gives you the hum, when you know the hum, and know what the hum feels like, when you once knew the hum, when the hum stops, who are you then?
What are you?
What am I?
Am I still a titan?
When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in the silence?
And then my "Southern waitress" asks me a question.
I'm on my way out, running late, and she says, "Mom, do you want to play?"
And I want to say no already when two things become clear to me:
Firstly, I have to say yes to everything, and secondly, she didn't call me "sweetheart."
She no longer calls anyone "sweetheart."
When did that happen?
I miss it when I am a titan and mourn my hum, and here everything changes before my very eyes.
And so she says, "Mom, do you want to play?"
And I say, "Yes."
There is nothing special about that.
We play, and her sisters join in; we laugh a lot, and I dramatically read from the book "Everybody Poops."
Nothing extraordinary.
But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the solitude and the absence of the hum, I can do nothing but pay attention.
I am focused.
I am quiet.
The land that I create, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high note - they no longer exist.
All that exists are sticky fingers and damp kisses, tender voices, crayons, and the song about letting go, or whatever the girl in "Frozen" lets go.
Everywhere there is peace and simplicity.
The air in this place is so thin that I can hardly breathe.
I can hardly believe that I am breathing.
Playing is the opposite of working.
And I am happy.
Something in me is unraveling.
A mental door opens and a surge of energy comes in.
And not immediately, but it happens, it happens.
I feel it.
The hum is slowly returning.
Not at full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, barely audible, but it is there.
Not the hum, but a hum.
And now I feel as if I know a magical secret.
But let's stay on topic.
It is love. That is all.
No magic. No secret. Just love.
It is something that we have forgotten.
The hum, the work hum, the titan hum, that is just the substitute.
If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself through shows and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I have forgotten what the real hum is.
The hum is not a force and it is not work-specific.
It depends on joy.
The real hum depends on love.
The hum is the current that comes from the joy of living.
The real hum is self-awareness and peace.
The real hum ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be completed, the expectations, and the pressure.
The real hum is simple and original.
The real hum is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me that I am a titan?
It is simply love.
We all need a little more love, a lot more love.
As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.
I make this a firm rule so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.
It is law; I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the hum again.
I wish it were that simple. I'm not good at playing; I don't like it.
Playing does not come to me nearly as easily as working.
The truth hurts,
but I don't like to play.
I am always working, because I love it.
I prefer being at work rather than at home.
This admission is painful, for what kind of person would rather work than be at home?
Well, yes, I.
Let's be honest, I call myself a "titan" --
I must have problems.
That I am too relaxed is none of them.
We rush around in the garden, back and forth, to and fro.
We have little dance parties,
we sing and play ball.
We pop soap bubbles.
In doing so, I mostly feel stiff, absent, and confused.
I always reach for my phone.
But it's okay.
My children show me how to live, and the hum of the universe fills me.
I play and play until I ask myself: Why did we ever stop playing?
You can too! Always say Yes when your child wants to play with you.
You might think of me as naive, as a daydreamer.
You are probably right, but you can do it too!
You have time!
And do you know why? You are not Rihanna or a Muppet Show character.
Your child finds you less interesting than you think.
It's only 15 minutes.
My little ones want to play with me for at most 15 minutes until they remember that they want to do something else.
It's a wonderful 15 minutes, but it's only 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, I'm replaced by a ladybug or a cookie.
And if my teenage daughter talks to me for a whole 15 minutes, I’m Mother of the Year.
It's only 15 minutes; that's all it takes.
Everyone can manage 15 minutes straight, even on a bad mood day!
15 minutes straight!
No phone, no laundry, no distractions whatsoever.
The day is short: dinner, getting the children ready for bed.
But 15 minutes are possible!
My children are my sanctuary, my world. They don't have to be the children. It is important to feel the hum, to have a place for one's peace of mind.
It's not about playing with one's own children. It's about joy.
to "playing" in general.
Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!
Find out what feels good for you.
Find out what it is and hold onto it.
I'm not perfect at it. I fail and I succeed. Meeting friends, reading books, enjoying the day --
"Do you want to play?" stands briefly for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show, when I became a titan in training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more.
15 minutes straight; why not treat yourself to a full 15 minutes?
What could be wrong with that? Nothing!
The hum returned in my free time. The hum seems to come back when I'm not working.
Work doesn't function without play.
It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens, energy flows in, and I find myself back in my office. I hear an unfamiliar melody; it fills me and my soul. It inspires me with new ideas. The hum has found its way back. I embrace it fully and love my work again.
I like the hum, but I don't love it.
I don't need it.
I am not the hum; the hum is not me... not anymore.
Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.
That is now my hum.
The hum of life.
The hum of love.
The hum of work is a part of me, but just one part now. And for that, I am so grateful.
I couldn't care less that I am a titan. I have never seen a titan playing musical chairs.
I said yes to less work and more play.
And yet, I have everything under control. My brain is still functioning. My campfires are still burning.
The more I play, the happier I and my children are.
The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.
The more I play, the clearer my mind is.
The more I play, the better I work.
The more I play, the more I hear the hum. The land I create, the marathon I run, the troops, the canvases, the high pitch, the hum, the hum, the other, the right hum: the hum of life.
The more I feel this hum, the more this unusual, trembling, raw, and new sensation of life spreads within me. Less titan -- more me!
The more I feel this very hum, the more I know who I am.
I am an author. I come up with ideas, I bring them to life.
That is part of the job; it means living your dream.
That is the dream of this job,
for a dream job should be a little dreamy.
I said "Yes" to less work and more play.
Titans stand no chance here.
"Do you want to play?"
Thank you very much.
