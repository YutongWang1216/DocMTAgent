        "new_tgt_summary": "The author reflects on the paradox of modern computers, acknowledging their impressive capabilities while also recognizing their shortcomings. A personal anecdote from a 2011 night in Harlem illustrates this point: during a conversation about holography with a classmate, the author felt frustrated as the classmate became distracted by his phone, contrasting with a group of students joyfully engaging with their devices. This experience prompted the author to consider how technology, rather than connecting people, often creates barriers. The author argues that tools should enhance our bodily functions and social interactions, but current computer usage tends to hinder these connections. They advocate for a more natural approach to technology that fosters genuine interaction.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author reflects on the paradox of modern computers, acknowledging their impressive capabilities while recognizing their shortcomings. A personal anecdote from a 2011 night in Harlem illustrates this point: during a conversation about holography, the author felt frustrated as a classmate became distracted by his phone, contrasting with a group of students joyfully engaging with their devices. This experience led the author to consider how technology often creates barriers rather than connections. They argue that tools should enhance our bodily functions and social interactions, advocating for a more natural approach to technology that fosters genuine interaction. In contrast, the discussion also highlights the potential of machines, like the Meta 2, to enhance our work by utilizing neuroscience principles to extend our senses. The speaker demonstrates this technology through interaction with a realistic holographic image, showcasing its applications in fields such as architecture, where designs can be visualized in 3D. Additionally, the speaker mentions a personal connection to the Glass Brain project by Professor Adam Gazzaley, which facilitates hands-on learning of brain structures. The overarching theme is the transformation of humanity through augmented reality, where digital information increasingly overlays the real world, enhancing our bodily functions rather than limiting them.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author reflects on the paradox of modern computers, recognizing their impressive capabilities alongside their shortcomings. A personal anecdote from a 2011 night in Harlem illustrates this point: during a conversation about holography, the author felt frustrated as a classmate became distracted by his phone, contrasting with a group of students joyfully engaging with their devices. This experience led the author to consider how technology often creates barriers rather than connections, advocating for tools that enhance our bodily functions and social interactions to foster genuine interaction. In contrast, the discussion highlights the potential of machines, like the Meta 2, which utilize neuroscience principles to extend our senses and enhance work, particularly in fields like architecture through realistic 3D visualizations. The speaker also mentions a personal connection to the Glass Brain project by Professor Adam Gazzaley, which aids hands-on learning of brain structures. Envisioning a future where devices resemble strip glasses projecting holographic images, the speaker emphasizes the importance of a brain-based operating system (iOS) for intuitive interaction, minimizing complexity by aligning with natural brain functions. The speaker outlines three design principles, highlighting that users become the operating system, contrasting traditional complex file systems with a more intuitive approach. The overarching theme is the transformation of humanity through augmented reality, where digital information overlays the real world, enhancing human experience and spatial memory rather than limiting it.",

        "new_src_summary": "本文探讨了现代电脑技术的矛盾性与增强现实技术的潜力，旨在创造一种新的人机交互体验，延伸人类的能力而非简单地游戏化现实。作者通过回忆2011年在哥伦比亚大学附近酒吧的经历，反思电子设备对人际交流的影响，指出手机的干扰使得人与人之间的交流表面化，而社交媒体的共同使用则带来了快乐。他呼吁技术应促进人际联系，开发更加自然的机器以提升交流质量。接着，文章转向增强现实技术（如Meta 2），强调这种技术应扩展人类能力，并通过亲身体验展示其在建筑设计和神经科学学习中的应用，预示着未来数字信息将覆盖现实世界，进一步延伸人类的功能。同时，作者提出未来五年内可能出现的全息眼镜设备，强调设计应以大脑的运作方式为指导，构建“零学习曲线”的操作系统，使用户能够直观使用。文中提到的设计原则包括将用户视为操作系统，简化信息解码过程，并利用空间记忆优化信息提取。此外，文段探讨了“接触可视”这一界面指南，强调视觉系统与本体感觉之间的关系，特别是在婴儿与其感兴趣事物互动时的表现。通过直接接触工作对象，人们不仅能更好地控制它们，还能更深入地理解它们。作者借助神经科学的概念，描述了通过全息摄影实现更好的互动，强调与他人建立联系的重要性。整体上，文段融合了科技与人文的视角，风格前瞻且充满探索性，展现了对未来技术发展的深刻思考与期待，同时涉及视觉、触觉和社交互动的综合性思考。",
        "new_tgt_summary": "The author reflects on the paradox of modern computers, acknowledging their impressive capabilities alongside their shortcomings. A personal anecdote from a 2011 night in Harlem illustrates this point: during a conversation about holography, the author felt frustrated as a classmate became distracted by his phone, contrasting with a group of students joyfully engaging with their devices. This experience prompted the author to consider how technology often creates barriers rather than connections, advocating for tools that enhance bodily functions and social interactions to foster genuine engagement. The discussion highlights the potential of machines, like the Meta 2, which utilize neuroscience principles to extend our senses and enhance work, particularly in fields like architecture through realistic 3D visualizations. The speaker expresses a personal connection to the Glass Brain project by Professor Adam Gazzaley, which aids hands-on learning of brain structures, and envisions a future where devices resemble strip glasses projecting holographic images. Emphasizing the importance of a brain-based operating system (iOS) for intuitive interaction, the speaker outlines three design principles, suggesting that users become the operating system, contrasting traditional complex file systems with a more intuitive approach. The overarching theme is the transformation of humanity through augmented reality, where digital information overlays the real world, enhancing human experience and spatial memory rather than limiting it. Additionally, the \"Touch Vision\" interface guide emphasizes the importance of engaging physically with objects to enhance understanding and control, akin to how babies reach for things that interest them, linking this concept to proprioception and social interaction. The \"Holographic Campfire\" concept illustrates that seeing 3D images of faces and hands fosters better interaction, demonstrated through the speaker's interaction with a holographic image, which highlights the connection between spatial memory and proprioception. The presentation concludes with an invitation for a 3D call with co-founder Ryan, underscoring the significance of social engagement in the experience.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author reflects on the paradox of modern computers, acknowledging their impressive capabilities alongside their shortcomings. A personal anecdote from a 2011 night in Harlem illustrates this point: during a conversation about holography, the author felt frustrated as a classmate became distracted by his phone, contrasting with a group of students joyfully engaging with their devices. This experience prompted the author to consider how technology often creates barriers rather than connections, advocating for tools that enhance bodily functions and social interactions to foster genuine engagement. The discussion highlights the potential of machines like the Meta 2, which utilize neuroscience principles to extend our senses and enhance work, particularly in fields like architecture through realistic 3D visualizations. The speaker expresses a personal connection to the Glass Brain project by Professor Adam Gazzaley, which aids hands-on learning of brain structures, and envisions a future where devices resemble strip glasses projecting holographic images. Emphasizing the importance of a brain-based operating system (iOS) for intuitive interaction, the speaker outlines three design principles, suggesting that users become the operating system, contrasting traditional complex file systems with a more intuitive approach. The overarching theme is the transformation of humanity through augmented reality, where digital information overlays the real world, enhancing human experience and spatial memory rather than limiting it. Additionally, the \"Touch Vision\" interface guide emphasizes engaging physically with objects to enhance understanding and control, linking this concept to proprioception and social interaction. The \"Holographic Campfire\" concept illustrates that seeing 3D images of faces and hands fosters better interaction, demonstrated through the speaker's interaction with a holographic image, which highlights the connection between spatial memory and proprioception. The presentation concludes with an invitation for a 3D call with co-founder Ryan, underscoring the significance of social engagement in the experience. The speaker also presents a lifelike holographic projection of Ryan, indicating that this technology will soon replace traditional phones and enhance collaboration. Ryan gifts the audience a holographic brain, emphasizing the transformative potential of this innovation. Mike Long Greibitz reflects on his 2011 insight that the future of computers lies within our bodies, not confined to screens, and announces that before TED 2017, Meta employees will transition to using these more natural machines, which are already present as early as 2016. Chris Anderson raises a question about the authenticity of holographic demonstrations seen in previous years.",
