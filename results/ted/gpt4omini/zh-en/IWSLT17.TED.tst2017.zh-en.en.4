We were right there. Souls and bodies crammed into a church in Texas, that was the last night of our lives.
Just like this room we are in now, except there were creaky wooden benches everywhere, tattered red cloth strips hanging, an organ to my left, the choir behind me, and a baptismal pool built into the wall at the back.
In short, just like this room.
The same intense sense of suspense, the same profound yearning for redemption, the same bittersweet sweat in the palms, and a similarly distracted group of people in the back row.
It was December 31, 1999, and that night, as far as I knew, Christ would return to Earth, and the world would face its end.
I was 12 years old then, the age at which one must take responsibility.
I found it so unfair that Jesus would return at this time, just as I was about to take responsibility for everything I had done before. But when I stopped complaining, I thought it best to quickly tidy up the house.
I go to church as much as I can.
I was afraid of the silence all around me, just as people fear noise, only to repeatedly confirm that God was not playing tricks on me, returning early and leaving me behind.
But just in case he really did come early, I have a backup plan that I read about in the once-popular book "Left Behind."
I read in the text that if the revelry past midnight ends and I am not taken away, I will have another chance.
I just need to avoid being labeled a heretic, defeat the demons, overcome the plague, and also bring down the Antichrist.
This will be quite difficult—but I believe I can do it.
But the time for preparation has long passed.
It is already 11:50 PM.
We had 10 minutes left, and the pastor asked us to rise from the pews and walk down to the altar below, because he wanted us to pray together at the moment midnight arrived.
The congregation then split into several groups and arrived at the designated spots.
The choir was still on the small stage, and the church deacons and their wives—though I preferred to call them the "Baptist bourgeoisie"—took their seats in the front row before the altar.
You know, in America, even on Christ's Second Coming Night, there are VIP seats.
And right behind the Baptist bourgeoisie were the older generation—these men and women whose youthful backs had been bent by the scorching sun in the cotton fields of East Texas, their furrowed faces burned to a noble brown, much like the clay of East Texas. Their beautiful fantasies and dreams about life and the world beyond East Texas were sometimes even more shattered than their backs.
Yes—these men and women are my idols, my stars.
They had waited their whole lives for this moment, just as their medieval ancestors longed for the end of the world, and just like my grandmother eagerly anticipated "The Oprah Winfrey Show," which aired promptly at four o'clock on Channel Eight every day.
As she walked towards the altar, I quietly slipped behind her, for I was certain that my grandmother was going to heaven.
I thought that if I held her hand tightly during this prayer, I might be able to go with her.
So I held on tightly, closed my eyes, listened, and waited.
The sound of prayer grew louder.
The cries in response to the prayer grew even louder.
The sound of the organ intertwined with the voices of the dirge.
A wave of heat swept over, and the sweat in my palms became even more acrid.
My hand clenched even tighter; I didn't want to be forsaken by God.
My eyes shut even tighter; I didn't want to see the essence being taken away, while the dross was left behind.
Suddenly, a voice echoed from above: "Amen."
It is over.
I glance at the clock.
It is already past midnight.
I looked at the elder congregants; their Savior had not come, and they were too proud to show even the slightest hint of disappointment. They had believed too deeply and for too long, and now it was too late to doubt.
But I felt anger for them.
They were fooled, deceived, and misled, yet I was still caught up in their delusion.
I prayed the prayers they offered, struggling hard against the desires within me.
I didn't just fall into that cold baptismal pool once, but twice.
I once believed.
What should I do now?
I got home and turned on the television, just in time to catch Peter Jennings announcing the new millennium, as the whole world celebrated the New Year.
I suddenly realized how strange it was to think that Jesus would return to Earth again and again simply because the time zones were different.
This made me feel even worse inside; it really hurt, truly.
But on that night, I did not stop believing.
I simply believed in another thing: that "not believing is also possible."
It is very likely that the answers I know are all wrong, and it is very likely that the question itself is wrong.
Now, the once towering peaks of faith have a spring flowing down to their base, a clear stream of doubt that is destined to become a great river.
All the dramatic stories of my life can be traced back to that night in the church, when my Savior did not arrive; the things I was so certain of, if not called "lies," were at least not truths.
Although most of you welcomed the new millennium in very different ways, I believe you are here because some of you have done things similar to what I did, things that happened after the dawn of the new century, after my mother passed away and my father left home, and after my Savior did not come.
I stretched out my hands, desperately searching for something to believe in.
When I arrived at Yale University at the age of 18, I was searching, believing that coming all the way from a small town in Texas, I had the chance to escape all the hardships and difficulties I had endured, to break free from those shattered dreams and broken bodies.
But when I returned to my hometown during winter break, with my head pressed to the ground and my hands tightly bound behind my back, a robber's gun pressed against my head, I knew that even the best education couldn't save me.
When I interned at Lehman Brothers in 2008, I was also searching.
Filled with hope—I excitedly called my family, saying we would never be poor again.
But as I watched this temple of finance crumble before my eyes, I knew that even the best job couldn't save me.
When I arrived in Washington, D.C. as a young journalist, I was searching, and I heard a voice from Illinois: (referring to Obama's campaign speech) "The time has come," "and in this election, America will embrace change."
But when the parliamentary work came to a complete standstill and the nation was on the brink of collapse, the so-called hope and change turned into a cruel joke, I knew that even a political revival couldn't save me.
I kneel reverently before the altar of the American Dream, praying to the great figures of our time for success, for wealth, and for power.
But each time the midnight bell tolls, I open my eyes and see that all these myths have died.
From this grave, I once again begin my search, not because I am brave, but because I know that without faith, I will perish.
So I went to another sanctuary to pay my respects, Harvard Business School—this time, I knew I could not simply accept the redemption offered by the institution.
No, I know I have more to do.
It all began in a dark corner of a crowded party, on a frigid deep winter night in Massachusetts, when my three friends and I posed a question that some young people with genuine aspirations have long asked: "How about a road trip?"
We didn't know where to go or how to get there, but we knew we had to set off.
Because what we have long yearned for in our lives is, as Jack Kerouac wrote, "to plunge into the endless dark night, disappearing into the distant horizon." Let's go out and see what people across the country are doing.
So even with opposing voices saying that we were taking too great a risk and gaining nothing in return, we still set off.
In the summer of 2013, we traveled 13,000 kilometers across America, passing through the cattle ranches of Montana, the abandoned urban landscape of Detroit, and the swamps of New Orleans. There, we found some people and worked for them in their small businesses, where achieving goals was the bottom line.
After studying at the "West Point of Capitalism," we realized that this idea was nothing short of revolutionary.
This idea spread and eventually grew into a nonprofit organization called "Master of Industrial Management Traveling Across America," which is also the main reason I am able to stand on this stage today.
It is able to spread because we discovered a strong desire among this generation to achieve goals and realize their life's value.
It is able to spread because we discovered countless entrepreneurs in the nooks and crannies of America, who create jobs, change lives, and just need a little help.
But to be honest, it is able to spread also because I have been striving to promote it. In order to spread this gospel,
There is nothing I wouldn’t do to help more people believe that we can heal the wounds of this broken nation, relying on one small business at a time.
However, it is precisely this process of spreading the gospel that has led me to acquire a somewhat different gospel, which I am here to share with you all today.
About a year ago, one evening, we attended a Harvard Business School alumni dinner at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
Underneath a full-sized model of a whale, I sit side by side with the titans of this era, who sing praises of their peers and their great achievements.
The room was filled with an air of pride, as the total assets under these individuals' names exceeded five hundred billion dollars.
We look down upon all of creation and feel that it is good.
However, it happened that two days later, I went to Harlem in New York, where I sat in an urban farm that had once been an abandoned parking lot, listening to a man named Tony talk about some children who come there every day.
They all live below the poverty line.
Many people pack all their belongings into backpacks, fearing that others will steal them in the shelter.
Some people come to Tony's farm, called "Harlem Grown," to get their only meal of the day.
Tony told me that he funded "Harlem Grown" entirely with his pension from working as a taxi driver for 20 years.
He said he didn't save a penny for himself, because although the project was considered a success, resources were still extremely scarce.
He said he would accept any help he could find.
And I am here to help him.
But as I left Tony, a sharp pain struck my heart, and tears dampened the corners of my eyes.
I felt the weight of inspiration; one night I could sit in a room and discuss a better world with hundreds of individuals whose combined wealth exceeds five hundred billion dollars, yet just two days later, in another room only fifty blocks away, a man without a salary struggles to provide his child with their only meal of the day.
However, it is not this glaring social inequality that brings tears to my eyes, nor is it the sight of these hungry, homeless children, nor the anger towards the 1%, or the pity for the 99%.
No, the reason my heart cannot find peace is that I have finally realized this country needs a complete transformation, and I am merely making minor repairs.
I realize that my story represents a group of people who hope to be self-sufficient, even when they are destitute; what my organization stands for is the fundamental, systemic support that has never reached Harlem, or the Appalachian Mountains, or the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans; my cry represents certain voices, those that sound meaningless, unrefined, and out of place.
And this sense of shame, this shame washed over me, just like the shame I felt sitting in front of the television, watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium, again, and again, and again.
I was deceived, fooled, and misled.
But this time, the hypocritical savior is myself.
You know, I have come a long way from that altar, the night I felt the world was about to end, from a small town where various dialects were spoken, believing that suffering was a gift from God to humanity, and I treated it as a creed, as an eternal truth.
Yes, my journey has been so long that I have come full circle back to the starting point.
Because we cannot simply generalize that this era lacks faith. No, we are believing in something just as we always have.
Some people may believe in the prophecies of Brené Brown or Tony Robbins. We might find ourselves believing in the maxims of The New Yorker or Harvard Business Review.
We may have immense faith in the things we worship in the church of TED, but we deeply yearn for faith; we need faith.
We imitate the charismatic leaders' words and actions, who promise to solve all of humanity's problems.
We perceive suffering as a gift from capitalism's "God," and we treat technological advancement as a creed, as an eternal truth.
But we have never realized the humanitarian cost of our contributions; we do not question a single brick, for we fear that the entire building might collapse.
But if you feel uneasy about these things that we have come to accept as normal, then the moment of questioning is bound to arrive.
So the gospel I spread is not about breakthroughs, innovations, or sustainable development.
I don't even have a gospel of faith to share with everyone.
The only thing I have is a gospel of questioning.
The gospel of questioning does not ask you to stop believing; it invites you to believe in something new: "It is also possible not to believe."
It is very likely that the answers we know are all wrong, and it is very likely that the questions themselves are wrong.
Yes, the gospel of questioning may imply that our existence, on this stage, in this room, is all wrong.
Because it raises a question: "Why?"
With such great power in our hands, why are there still people suffering in dire straits?
This questioning has led me to make a decision: the organization I founded, "Master of Industrial Management Traveling Across America," will cease operations.
We have already disbanded the staff and closed the doors for good. We have opened this model to everyone; as long as they feel capable of doing it, they do not need our approval.
This questioning forces me to remove the "savior" label that others have placed upon me, because our lives are too short and the chances are too slim; we simply cannot wait for Christ's return. The truth is, there are no miracles in this world.
And this questioning drives me; it gives me hope. When difficulties are about to overwhelm us, when the path of fate seems to lead us astray, when our Savior cannot heal our wounds, it is not our blind faith, but our simple questioning that will sprinkle a little light into the darkness of our lives and the world. Let us whisper gently,
Shouting is fine, or simply put, very simply put: "There must be another way."
Thank you.
