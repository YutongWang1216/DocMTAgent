Alright, I would like everyone to raise their hands to indicate how many of you have ever unfriended someone on Facebook because they made inappropriate comments about politics, religion, children's rights, or food?
How many people have at least one person they don’t want to see, simply because you don’t want to talk to them?
It is important to note that in the past, if you wanted to have a polite conversation, you only needed to follow the advice of Henry Higgins in "Pygmalion": just talk about the weather and your health.
But in recent years, with climate change and the rise of the anti-vaccine movement, this approach has become less effective.
Therefore, in the world we live in, where every conversation has the potential to escalate into an argument, it is abnormal that politicians cannot communicate with each other, and that there are people who passionately support or oppose even the most trivial matters.
The Pew Research Center conducted a survey of 10,000 American adults and found that our level of extremism and the clarity of our positions at this moment is higher than at any point in history.
We are even less inclined to compromise, which means we are not listening to each other.
The various decisions we make, such as where to live, whom to marry, and even whom to befriend, are all based solely on our existing beliefs.
To reiterate, this indicates that we are not listening to each other.
Conversation requires a balance between speaking and listening, yet somehow, we have gradually lost this balance.
Technological advancements are part of the reason.
For example, smartphones are now in your hands or right next to you, easily accessible at any moment.
According to Pew's research, about one-third of American teenagers send more than 100 text messages each day.
And among many people, almost everyone, is more inclined to send text messages to friends rather than engage in face-to-face conversations.
The Atlantic magazine published a great article,
The author is high school teacher Paul Barnwell.
He assigned his students a communication task,
I hope to teach them how to give a speech on a topic without relying on notes.
Then he said, "I began to realize..."
"I began to realize that communication skills might be the most overlooked and poorly taught abilities."
"Children spend hours each day engaging with creativity and other peers through screens, but they have few opportunities to develop their interpersonal skills."
"This may sound funny, but we must ask ourselves: in the 21st century, what skill could be more important than maintaining a coherent and confident conversation?"
Now, my profession is talking to others: Nobel laureates, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, governors, and plumbers.
I talk to people I like, and I also talk to people I dislike.
I talk to people with whom I strongly disagree on a personal level.
But I still have good communication with them.
So I hope to spend the next ten minutes teaching you how to converse and how to listen.
Many of you have already heard countless suggestions, such as looking into each other's eyes, preparing interesting topics for discussion in advance, maintaining eye contact, nodding, and smiling to show your engagement, repeating what you just heard, or summarizing.
I want you to forget all of this.
"None of it is useful."
"There is no need to learn how to appear attentive if you are genuinely attentive."
I actually apply the exact same skills as a professional interviewer in my daily life.
Alright, I am going to teach you how to interview others, which will actually help you learn how to become better communicators.
Learning to initiate a conversation without wasting time, feeling bored, and, most importantly, without offending anyone.
"We have all had great conversations."
"We have all experienced it. We know what that feels like."
"Those conversations that leave you feeling fulfilled and inspired afterward, or make you feel like you've established a genuine connection with others, or that allow you to fully be understood by others."
"There is no reason to say that most of your interpersonal interactions cannot be like that."
I have ten basic rules. I will explain them to you one by one, but honestly, if you choose one and master it, you will already be able to enjoy more pleasant conversations.
The first rule: Do not be indecisive.
"I'm not saying to simply put down your phone, tablet, car keys, or whatever else you have in your hands."
What I mean is to be present in the moment.
Enter into that situation.
"Don't think about the argument you had with your boss earlier."
"Don't think about what you will have for dinner."
If you want to exit the conversation, then exit the conversation. But don’t be physically present while mentally elsewhere.
"Rule Two: Do not be a know-it-all."
If you want to express your opinion but don't want to leave any opportunity for others to respond, debate, refute, or elaborate, write a blog.
There is a good reason why my conversations do not allow for "expert lecturing": because it's really boring.
If the other person is a conservative, they must hate Obama, food stamps, and abortion.
If the other person is a liberal, they must hate big banks, oil companies, and Dick Cheney.
"Completely predictable."
"You certainly wouldn't want it to be that way."
You need to assume that you can learn something each time you engage in a conversation.
The renowned therapist M. Scott Peck once said that true listening requires putting oneself aside.
Sometimes, this means putting your personal opinions aside.
He said that feeling this acceptance, the speaker becomes less vulnerable and sensitive, and thus more likely to open up their inner world to the listener.
Let me reiterate, assume that you need to learn something new.
Bill Nye said, "Everyone you are going to meet knows something you don't."
Let me reiterate: everyone is an expert in some way.
The third point: use open-ended questions.
Regarding this, please refer to the questioning techniques used in journalistic interviews.
Start your questions with "who," "what," "when," "where," "why," or "how."
If you ask a complex question, you will receive a simple answer.
If I ask you, "Were you afraid at that time?"
You will respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, which is "fear," and the answer will be "yes" or "no."
"If I asked you, 'Were you angry at that time?' you would respond, 'Yes, I was very angry.'"
Let the other person describe it; they are the ones who understand the situation.
Try asking the other person, "What does that look like?"
"How do you feel?"
Because of this, the other person may need to pause and think, and you will receive more interesting answers.
The fourth point: go with the flow.
In other words, thoughts will naturally flow into your mind, and you need to express them.
We often hear guests speaking for a few minutes during interviews, and then the host comes back to ask a question that seems to come out of nowhere or has already been answered.
This suggests that the host may not have been listening two minutes ago, as they were preoccupied with formulating this very clever question and were fixated on asking it.
We will do the same.
As we sit together talking with someone, we suddenly recall that encounter with Hugh Jackman at the coffee shop.
Then we stop listening.
Stories and ideas will continuously flow to you,
But even if you cannot stop them, do not let them linger too long in your mind.
The fifth point: If you don't know, just say you don't know.
People on radio programs, especially those on National Public Radio, are very aware that their conversations will be broadcast. Therefore, they are more cautious about the areas they claim to be experts in and the things they assert confidently.
You should learn to do this. Speak and act with caution.
Conversation should be a responsible act.
Rule six: Do not compare your experiences with those of others.
If the other person talks about losing a family member, do not take that opportunity to start talking about your own loss.
If the other person is talking about their work-related troubles, do not tell them how much you hate your job.
This is different; it can never be the same.
Every experience is unique.
Moreover, and more importantly, this is not about your situation.
You do not need to prove how capable you are or how much pain you have endured at this moment.
Someone once asked Stephen Hawking what his IQ was, and he replied, "I don't know. People who brag about their IQ are just losers."
Conversation is not meant to sell yourself.
Seventh rule: Try not to repeat yourself.
This is very aggressive and quite boring. But we can easily do this.
Especially in work conversations or when talking with children, we want to make a point, so we keep saying it in different ways.
Don't do that.
Eighth rule: Minimize the small talk.
In short, no one cares about those years, names, dates, and all the other details you are trying hard to recall in your mind.
Others don't care. They are focused on you.
The other party is concerned about what kind of person you are and what commonalities you share.
So forget the details. Don't worry about them.
Rule Nine: This is not the last rule, but it is the most important one.
Listen attentively.
I can't say how many important figures have stated that listening might be the most important, the primary skill you can improve.
Buddha said — let me paraphrase, "If you keep talking, you won't learn anything."
Calvin Coolidge once said, "No one ever got fired for listening too much."
Why are we unwilling to listen to each other?
First, we prefer to speak.
When I am speaking, everything is under my control.
I don't have to listen to anything I'm not interested in.
I am the focus.
I can strengthen my sense of identity.
But there is another reason: we are easily distracted.
On average, a person speaks about 225 words per minute, but we can listen to nearly 500 words per minute.
So our minds are occupied by those additional 275 words.
I know it takes a lot of effort to truly pay attention to what others are saying. But if you don't do this, you are not having a conversation.
You are just two people shouting irrelevant things at each other in the same place.
You must listen to each other.
Stephen Covey has a brilliant discussion on this.
He said, "Most of us do not listen to understand."
"We listen in order to respond."
Rule Ten: Be concise.
"Good conversation is like the perfect mini skirt; short enough to be interesting, yet long enough to cover the subject — a metaphor from my sister." All of this is condensed into the same concept, which is: to take an interest in others.
I grew up beside a celebrity grandfather, with guests constantly coming and going in my home.
Visitors would come to talk with my grandparents, and after they left, my mother would come over to us and say, "Do you know who that was?"
She is the runner-up of Miss America.
He is the mayor of Sacramento.
She has won the Pulitzer Prize. He is a Russian ballet dancer.
I have come to accept throughout my growth that everyone has their own undiscovered brilliance.
To be honest, I think it is all of this that has made me a better host.
I try to speak less, but keep my mind open, always ready to be surprised, and I never feel disappointed.
You can do this too.
Step outside, talk to others, listen to what they have to say, and most importantly, be ready to be surprised.
Thank you.
