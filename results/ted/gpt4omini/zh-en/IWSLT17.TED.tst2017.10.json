        "new_tgt_summary": "Matthew Williams introduces himself as a champion athlete who has won medals in multiple sports and represented Canada at international basketball events. He trains rigorously in basketball and speed skating with professional coaches and sports psychologists, attributing his success to the Special Olympics, which has significantly improved the treatment of individuals with intellectual disabilities since its inception in 1968. Despite this progress, he highlights ongoing discrimination and derogatory treatment, sharing personal experiences of being called names that diminish his achievements. He emphasizes that he is not seeking pity but aims to raise awareness about the continued stigma faced by people with intellectual disabilities. Matthew mentions the upcoming World Games in Los Angeles, where he will compete alongside 6,500 athletes from 165 countries, and he urges others to reflect on their perceptions of individuals like him.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "Matthew Williams, a champion athlete who has won medals in multiple sports and represented Canada in international basketball events, introduces himself as a strong advocate for equal treatment of individuals with intellectual disabilities. He trains rigorously in basketball and speed skating with professional coaches and sports psychologists, crediting the Special Olympics for significantly improving the treatment and societal views of people with intellectual disabilities since its inception in 1968. Despite this progress, he highlights ongoing discrimination and derogatory treatment, sharing personal experiences of being belittled, while emphasizing that he seeks to raise awareness about the stigma that still exists. He reflects on his personal journey, having faced challenges due to epilepsy and an intellectual disability, which initially led to feelings of isolation before joining the Special Olympics. He credits Dr. Frank Hayden's research on the health benefits of sports and Eunice Kennedy Shriver's advocacy for the establishment of the Special Olympics, which offers year-round sports programs that transform athletes' self-perception and lives. Through participation, he gained confidence and friendships, ultimately becoming a basketball player and speed skater set to compete in the upcoming Summer Special Olympics in Los Angeles alongside 6,500 athletes from 165 countries. Matthew urges others to reflect on their perceptions of individuals like him and emphasizes the positive effects of sports, supported by the experiences of millions of athletes worldwide.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "Matthew Williams, a champion athlete representing Canada in various sports, is a strong advocate for equal treatment of individuals with intellectual disabilities. He trains rigorously in basketball and speed skating, crediting the Special Olympics for improving societal views and treatment of this community since its inception in 1968. Despite the progress made, he highlights ongoing discrimination and derogatory treatment, sharing personal experiences of being belittled, and aims to raise awareness about the stigma that persists. Williams reflects on his journey, having faced challenges due to epilepsy and an intellectual disability, which led to feelings of isolation before joining the Special Olympics. He acknowledges the impact of Dr. Frank Hayden's research on sports' health benefits and Eunice Kennedy Shriver's advocacy for the organization, which provides year-round sports programs that enhance athletes' self-perception and lives. Through participation, he gained confidence and friendships, preparing to compete in the upcoming Summer Special Olympics in Los Angeles alongside 6,500 athletes from 165 countries.\n\nParticipation in the Special Olympics not only helps athletes regain confidence and dignity but also addresses critical health needs, as individuals with intellectual disabilities often face significantly shorter life expectancies. The organization promotes health, offers nutritional education, and provides free health screenings, particularly for those struggling to access healthcare. For example, during the 2015 Summer Special Olympics, Nigerian athletes received hearing aids, improving their ability to communicate and engage with their surroundings. This transformation extends beyond sports, positively impacting their overall lives. However, societal attitudes towards individuals with intellectual disabilities remain problematic, with many holding negative views and lacking personal connections. The derogatory use of terms like \"fool\" continues to marginalize this community, as evidenced by its frequent usage on social media. Athlete Franklin Stephens has advocated for awareness and understanding by inviting others to witness the Special Olympics firsthand. Matthew urges others to reflect on their perceptions of individuals like him and emphasizes the positive effects of sports, supported by the experiences of millions of athletes worldwide.",
