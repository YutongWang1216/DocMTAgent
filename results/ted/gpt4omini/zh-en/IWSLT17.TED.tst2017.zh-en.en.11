You may have never heard of Kenema in Sierra Leone, or Aroua in Nigeria.
But I think they are the two most wonderful places in the world.
In the hospital there, there is a community made up of nurses, surgeons, and scientists who have been quietly combating one of humanity's deadliest threats—the Lassa virus—for many years.
The Lassa virus is very similar to the Ebola virus.
It can cause severe fever symptoms and is often fatal.
However, these individuals risk their lives every day to protect each member of the community, while also safeguarding all of us.
One of the most wonderful things I learned from them is that many years ago, when I first visited during those challenging days on the front lines, they began each day like this—singing.
They gather together to fully express their joy.
They embody a spirit.
Many years have passed, and as we visited each other year after year, I could gather with them to sing, and we would record these moments. We love doing this because it reminds us that we are not only seeking the truths of science together, but there is also a bond of humanity that connects us closely.
Moreover, you can imagine that when changes occur around us, this connection becomes extremely important, even indispensable.
In March 2014, a major change occurred. The Ebola outbreak erupted in Guinea.
This was the first outbreak of the epidemic in West Africa, occurring at the border between Sierra Leone and Libya.
The situation was terrifying, and we were all shocked.
In fact, we even suspected that the spread of the Lassa and Ebola epidemics was broader than we had imagined, and we worried that one day it would reach Kenema.
So my team members immediately set off to join Dr. Humar Khan and his team there, where we set up diagnostic equipment to conduct some sensitive molecular tests, so that we could detect the Ebola virus as it crossed the border into Sierra Leone.
We had long set up equipment of this scale for the Lassa virus, and we knew how to respond; this team is exceptionally outstanding.
We just need to provide them with the equipment and space to study Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day has arrived.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to the maternity ward of the hospital, and our team conducted those important molecular tests, confirming the first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
This is truly remarkable.
They were able to diagnose the condition promptly, treat patients safely, and begin tracing contacts to monitor the spread of the disease.
It could have prevented something.
However, when that day arrived, the outbreak had been brewing for several months.
After discovering hundreds of cases, it made all previous outbreaks seem insignificant.
Moreover, the virus did not enter Sierra Leone through that single case; it was a massive shockwave.
We need to work closely with the international community, the Ministry of Health, and the local authorities in Kenema to collectively respond to these cases. In the following week, 31 patients arrived, then 92, and later it rose to 147—all flooding into Kenema, as it was one of the few places in Sierra Leone capable of handling the outbreak.
We worked tirelessly day and night, giving our all to help every patient, hoping to gain everyone's attention, but we also did one other simple thing.
To detect the Ebola virus, we extracted samples from the patients' blood, and of course, we could have simply discarded them.
However, in fact, another thing we could do was to add chemical agents to the samples to inactivate them, then seal them in boxes and transport them across the ocean. And that is exactly what we did.
We sent the samples to Boston, where my team works.
We also worked tirelessly day and night, taking shifts every day, and as a result, we quickly organized 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
This is a blueprint—the genome of the virus is a blueprint.
We humans have it too.
It details everything that makes up our bodies, providing us with a wealth of information.
The results of this work are simple yet powerful.
We can take these 99 different viral variants, observe and compare them, and we can clearly see that, compared to the three genomes released from Guinea, we can find that the disease had already begun to spread in Guinea months ago, and once it infiltrates the population, it can spread rapidly through person-to-person contact.
This information is actually crucial, especially when you are researching how to hinder the spread of the virus. However, the most important aspect is contact tracing.
We can also see that as the virus spreads from person to person, it continues to mutate.
Each variant is incredibly important, as all diagnostics, vaccines, and treatment methods we use are fundamentally based on that specific genomic sequence, which is the root cause of the outbreak's spread.
Therefore, global health experts need to respond swiftly, improve research methods, and adjust everything they are doing.
However, from my perspective at the time, the method of scientific research was that I would obtain the data, possibly spending several months locked in the laboratory meticulously analyzing it, writing the paper to submit it, revising it repeatedly, and only then would the paper be made public, allowing the data to be disclosed.
This was the state of scientific research at the time.
Well, that method was certainly ineffective at that specific time, wasn't it?
Some of our friends are working on the front lines against the disease, and it is clear that what we need most is external assistance—lots of it.
So the first thing we did was to immediately publish the genomic sequencing results online as soon as they came out of the machine.
We made our situation public to the whole world and said, "Help us!"
Assistance soon followed.
We had barely reacted when a large group of people from all over the world proactively reached out to us, excited to see that this data was made public online.
Some of the world's most outstanding virus trackers suddenly became part of our team!
We collaborated in this virtual manner, sharing information, frequently communicating over the phone, and maintaining contact, hoping to track the spread of the virus in real-time and find ways to contain it.
In fact, there are many ways for us to form such a group.
Everyone, especially when the pandemic broke out globally, was continuously seeking information and getting involved.
Everyone wants to make a contribution.
The power of everyone in the world is truly remarkable, and the internet connects us all.
Can you imagine? We are no longer afraid to communicate with others; we all say, "Let’s get to work."
"Let us work together; we can definitely do it!"
But the problem is that the data we all accessed, the data we found on Google, is far from meeting the needs of our work.
When this happens, we miss many opportunities.
So at the early stage of the outbreak in Kenema, we had 106 clinical records of patients, and once again we made all of this public.
In our own laboratory, if you provide us with those 106 records, we can use the computer to predict the next Ebola patients with an accuracy close to 100%.
We also developed an application specifically to publish these predictions, allowing health workers around the world to access this information.
But 106 reports are far from enough and are insufficient to make this method effective.
So we are waiting for more clinical reports before we can release that software.
But these reports have yet to arrive.
We are still waiting, continuously refining the software, huddled in the laboratory instead of collaborating with everyone.
This is truly unacceptable to us.
Right? None of you can accept this.
Now is a critical moment where lives hang in the balance.
However, in reality, many people sacrificed their lives, including my esteemed colleagues in the medical field: five colleagues—Mbarou Fonnie, Alex Mubi, Dr. Humar Khan, Alice Kowoma, and Mohamed Fula.
These are just five among the countless healthcare workers who sacrificed their lives in Kenema and elsewhere, while the world has been waiting; we have been working tirelessly, with individuals remaining independent and disconnected from one another.
The Ebola virus, like many other threats to humanity, can escalate due to distrust, fragmentation, and barriers between individuals.
When we build barriers between each other and fight amongst ourselves, the virus becomes even more rampant.
However, Ebola is unlike other threats, because this time, we have become one family.
"We are all on the same front line."
If one person contracts Ebola, we might be the next.
So we live in this world, sharing common vulnerabilities, common strengths, common fears, and common hopes. I sincerely hope that we can work together with joy.
One of my former students, after reading a book about Sierra Leone, came across the term "Kenema," the name of the city and the hospital where we worked in Sierra Leone. In the local Mende language, it means "as transparent and clear as a river, and within reach of everyone's gaze."
This holds profound significance for us, though we may not fully realize it. However, we have always felt that in honoring everyone in Kenema, the place where we have fought, we must embrace open collaboration, share information, and move forward together.
We must do this.
Everyone should hold themselves and others to this standard—when disaster strikes, we should open our hearts to one another and fight this battle together.
Because this is not the first outbreak of Ebola, nor will it be the last, there are many other microorganisms lurking around us in the world, just like the Lassa virus and other organisms.
The next time disaster strikes, it may occur in a city with a population of a million, and that is where it might erupt.
The virus may be transmitted through the air.
The virus may even be deliberately spread by individuals.
I know this is frightening, and I can understand that, but I also know that this experience has shown us that we have the technology and the capability to win this battle—not only to win this battle but also to stay one step ahead of all viruses.
But we can only achieve this when we work together in earnest, and we must do so with joy in our hearts.
So for Dr. Khan, and for all those who sacrificed themselves on the front lines of the fight against the disease—those who will forever stand shoulder to shoulder with us—let us also fight alongside them eternally.
Our world should not be defined by the devastation caused by a virus; we must let the brilliance of billions of united hearts spread across the earth.
Thank you, everyone.
