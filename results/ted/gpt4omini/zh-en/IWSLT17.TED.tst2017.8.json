        "new_tgt_summary": "In 1985, upon moving to Harare, I witnessed Zimbabwe's commitment to social justice reflected in its national health policy, which included free health care and primary education following independence in 1980. Significant progress was made, with routine vaccinations for children increasing from 25% in 1980 to 80% by 1990, and rural health centers became accessible to 80% of the population within a two-hour walk. However, I also faced challenges, particularly with the emergence of AIDS; the infection rate rose from 2% when I arrived to one in four adults by the time I left 17 years later. During this period, I informed many young people of their positive AIDS diagnoses and witnessed numerous deaths among colleagues, friends, and patients. In response, my colleagues and I opened a clinic to promote condom use, conduct awareness campaigns, and provide research and advice on protecting partners of individuals with AIDS, feeling part of both a national and global public health movement.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In 1985, after moving to Harare, I observed Zimbabwe's commitment to social justice through its national health policy, which provided free health care and primary education following independence in 1980. Notable progress was evident as routine vaccinations for children rose from 25% in 1980 to 80% by 1990, and rural health centers became accessible to 80% of the population within a two-hour walk. However, I faced significant challenges, particularly with the AIDS epidemic, which escalated from a 2% infection rate upon my arrival to one in four adults by the time I left 17 years later. During this period, I informed many young people of their positive AIDS diagnoses and witnessed numerous deaths among colleagues, friends, and patients. In response, my colleagues and I opened a clinic to promote condom use, conduct awareness campaigns, and provide research and advice on protecting partners of individuals with AIDS, feeling part of a broader public health movement. The author reflects on their efforts to provide medical care during this crisis, acknowledging a lack of constructive change and expressing regret over the AIDS epidemic, which has claimed 39 million lives. They note high infection rates among marginalized groups, particularly in sugar plantations, and emphasize that AIDS is linked to societal issues such as patriarchy and colonialism, rather than being a moral failing. Despite rising infection rates and disparities in access to treatment, the author admits to refraining from speaking out against government policies due to fear of repercussions that could hinder their work.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In 1985, after moving to Harare, the author observed Zimbabwe's commitment to social justice through its national health policy, which provided free health care and primary education following independence in 1980. Notable progress was evident as routine vaccinations for children rose from 25% in 1980 to 80% by 1990, and rural health centers became accessible to 80% of the population within a two-hour walk. However, significant challenges arose with the AIDS epidemic, escalating from a 2% infection rate upon the author's arrival to one in four adults by the time they left 17 years later. During this period, the author informed many young people of their positive AIDS diagnoses and witnessed numerous deaths among colleagues, friends, and patients. In response, they and their colleagues opened a clinic to promote condom use, conduct awareness campaigns, and provide research and advice on protecting partners of individuals with AIDS, feeling part of a broader public health movement. The author reflects on their efforts to provide medical care during this crisis, acknowledging a lack of constructive change and expressing regret over the epidemic, which has claimed 39 million lives. They note high infection rates among marginalized groups, particularly in sugar plantations, emphasizing that AIDS is linked to societal issues such as patriarchy and colonialism, rather than being a moral failing. Despite rising infection rates and disparities in access to treatment, the author refrained from speaking out against government policies due to fear of repercussions. Additionally, as the Health Commissioner of New York City, the author underscores the importance of recognizing social injustices, such as marginalization, racism, and class discrimination, that contribute to health disparities, particularly in infectious diseases like AIDS and Ebola. They argue that the commitment to patients, embodied in the Hippocratic Oath, must also address structural inequalities, which they term \"structural violence.\" Highlighting alarming statistics, including a 50% higher premature mortality rate for Black individuals compared to White individuals, along with significantly higher maternal and infant mortality rates for Black women and infants, the author advocates for speaking out against racism and inequality in healthcare, stressing that these issues are deeply rooted in the nation's history and must be confronted to create real change.",
