When I was in college, I majored in Public Administration, which meant I had to write a lot of papers.
When an ordinary student writes a paper, they might do it like this, breaking the task down.
So, you understand that it might start off a bit slow, but after a week, I had already written quite a bit, and then sometimes I wrote even more; in the end, everything was sorted out, and things didn't go wrong.
I want to do it this way, too.
At least, that's how I plan to do it.
I was ready to start; however, in reality, when it came time to write the papers, this is how I did it.
And every time I wrote a paper, it was like this.
Finally, when it came time to write the 90-page thesis, a paper that should have taken a year to complete.
I knew that my usual approach wouldn't work for a paper like this.
The thesis is a big project.
So I made a plan and decided to go about it this way.
The work for the year is arranged like this.
At first, I did a little less, then for a few months I kept pushing a bit more, and finally, I went all out at full speed, just like stepping up a small staircase.
How difficult can it be to climb stairs?
It's no big deal, right?
But then, something interesting happened.
What about those first few months?
They came and went; I basically did nothing.
So there came this wonderful revision plan.
And then... the months in between just passed by like that; I hardly wrote a few words, so it turned out this way.
Then it went from having two months left to one month, and then to just two weeks remaining.
Then one day, I suddenly realized that there were only three days left until the deadline, and I hadn’t written a single word. So I did the only thing I could do: I spent 72 hours writing 90 pages, pulling all-nighters for two straight days. A person shouldn’t go without sleep for two consecutive nights, but I rushed through campus at full speed, stealthily slipping in just before the deadline to submit my thesis.
I thought everything had come to an end like this.
A week later, I received a phone call from the school.
They asked, "Are you Tim Urban?"
I said, "That's right."
They said, "We need to talk to you about your thesis."
I replied, "Sure."
The other party then said, "This is the best thesis we've ever seen."
(Applause) That didn't happen.
This thesis was written very, very poorly.
I just wanted to enjoy this moment when all of you thought, "This guy is amazing!"
That's not the case; that thesis was really terrible.
Regardless, I am now a blog author.
I write blog posts to "get to the bottom of things."
A few years ago, I decided to write an article about procrastination.
My procrastination always confuses those around me who don't procrastinate, so I want to explain to non-procrastinators what goes on in the minds of procrastinators and why we procrastinators behave this way.
My hypothesis is that the brains of procrastinators are different from those of non-procrastinators.
To prove this, I found an MRI laboratory that would allow me to scan my brain and the brain of someone who has been confirmed not to be a procrastinator, so that I could compare the two brains.
Today, I brought them all along.
I hope everyone can seriously compare whether there are any differences between the two.
I know that everyone is not trained brain specialists, and it may not be obvious, but let's take a look, shall we?
This is the brain of a non-procrastinator.
Now,
This is my brain.
There is a difference between the two.
Both types of brains have a rational decision-maker, but in the brain of a procrastinator, there is also a monkey called Instant Gratification.
What does this mean for procrastinators?
It means that everything was fine before this happened.
[Now is the best time to get to work.] [Not at all!] So when the rational decision-maker makes a rational decision to do something productive, the monkey doesn't want to do that, and he takes control of the steering wheel, saying, "Actually, let's read about the scandal involving Nancy Kerrigan/Tonya Harding on Wikipedia, because I just remembered this."
Then let's head to the fridge and see if there's anything new in the past ten minutes.
Then, let's continue browsing on the video website, starting with the video of Richard Feynman talking about magnetism, and keep watching until we see the interview with Justin Bieber's mom, watching until the end of time.
"All of this takes time, so there's no way we can squeeze in some work in today's schedule."
"I'm sorry!"
What’s going on here?
The Instant Gratification monkey doesn't seem to be the one you want controlling the steering wheel.
He lives entirely in the moment.
He has no memories of the past, no understanding of the future; he only cares about two things: simplicity and happiness.
In the animal kingdom, this is perfectly fine.
If you are a dog, living your life simply and happily is already a tremendous success!
As for the monkey, humans are another kind of animal.
You sleep well, eat enough, and reproduce the next generation; doing so might have been acceptable in tribal times.
However, if you haven't noticed, we are no longer living in tribal times.
We are in an advanced civilization, and the monkey has no idea what that is.
This is why there is another guy in our heads, the rational decision-maker, who gives us the ability to do things that other animals cannot.
We can foresee the future.
We can take the overall situation into account.
We can make long-term plans.
Moreover, he wants to take all of this into account.
He wants us to do anything worth doing right now.
Sometimes, doing simple and enjoyable things is meaningful, such as eating, sleeping, or enjoying the leisure time one deserves.
This is why there is an overlap between the Instant Gratification monkey and the rational decision-maker.
Sometimes they are in agreement.
However, sometimes it is more meaningful to engage in those things that are comparatively difficult and less enjoyable, as this is driven by a broader perspective.
At this point, a conflict arises between the two.
For procrastinators, each conflict ends in this way: they spend a significant amount of time in the orange zone, which is that simple yet enjoyable area that lacks meaning.
I refer to this area as the dark playground.
The dark playground is a place that all procrastinators are very familiar with.
This is a recreational activity venue for leisure at times when one should not be relaxing.
The pleasure derived from the dark playground is not true happiness, as it is completely unearned; it brings guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-loathing—feelings common to all procrastinators.
Moreover, the problem is that in this situation, the monkey is in control of the steering wheel; how can procrastinators steer themselves toward the blue zone, where, although it may not be as comfortable, there are many important tasks to be done?
In fact, procrastinators have a guardian angel that always looks down on them and watches over them; in those darkest moments, it is known as the Panic Monster.
The Panic Monster is mostly in hibernation, but when deadlines are approaching, or when there is a risk of embarrassing oneself in public, or facing a career disaster, or encountering other dreadful consequences, it suddenly awakens.
Moreover, it is important to note that he is the only thing the monkey fears.
Recently, the Panic Monster has become quite significant in my life, as the staff from TED contacted me six months ago, inviting me to give a talk.
Of course, I agreed.
I have always dreamed of giving a TED talk.
(Applause) However, in this excitement, the rational decision-maker seems to be thinking about something else.
He would say, "Are we clear about what we just agreed to?"
Do we now have the ability to complete that future task?
"We need to sit down and get to work."
And the monkey says, "I completely agree, but let's open Google Earth, zoom in 200 feet underground in India, and then spend two and a half hours scrolling up to the surface of this country so we can get a better feel for India."
That’s exactly what I did that day.
As the six months turned into four months, then two months, and finally one month, the staff from TED began to announce the speakers.
I opened the website and saw my face staring back at me.
Guess who woke up at that moment?
Thus, the Panic Monster began to go wild, and within seconds, the entire system was in chaos.
And the monkey, remember? He fears the Panic Monster, and with a bang, he climbed up the tree!
Finally, the rational decision-maker can take the wheel, and I can start preparing for this presentation.
From the perspective of the Panic Monster, all those rather foolish procrastination behaviors are akin to someone like me who took two weeks to even start writing the introduction of the thesis, and then miraculously found an incredible burst of motivation to stay up all night and write eight pages.
This entire situation, along with those three roles, constitutes the procrastinator's system.
Not ideal, but at least it's useful.
This is something I decided to write about on my blog a few years ago.
After the announcement, the responses I received took me by surprise.
I received thousands of emails from people in different places around the world, each engaged in a variety of activities.
There were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and many, many doctoral students.
The content is essentially the same: "I have this problem too."
However, what impressed me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heavy tone of those emails.
These individuals experience a strong sense of frustration because procrastination affects their lives, as the monkey controls their thoughts.
After some thought, my question is, if the procrastinator's system can function, then what exactly is going on?
Why do these individuals all have such a dark corner?
As a result, I discovered that there are actually two types of procrastination.
The examples I mentioned today all have deadlines.
When there is a deadline, the impact of procrastination is confined to a shorter timeframe because the Panic Monster intervenes.
However, the second type of procrastination occurs in the absence of a deadline.
For example, if you want to start your own business or pursue a career in the arts, initially there is no deadline, because nothing will happen until you begin to put in the effort; there is no momentum to drive things forward.
Aside from career-related matters, there are also important things that have no deadline, such as visiting your family, exercising to maintain your health, working to improve your romantic relationship, or leaving an unsatisfactory relationship.
If procrastinators engage in these difficult tasks, there is only one mechanism—the Panic Monster. However, the problem arises because, in these situations without deadlines, the Panic Monster does not appear at all.
He has no moment that requires him to wake up, so the consequences of procrastination are unrestrained; they will only be indefinitely postponed.
This long-term procrastination is less noticeable and not often discussed compared to the more interesting, shorter-term procrastination that is deadline-based.
It usually affects us quietly and subtly.
It may be a significant source of long-term unhappiness and guilt.
I believe this is the reason those individuals sent the emails, and this is why they find themselves in such a terrible situation.
It’s not because they are rushing for a particular project,
Rather, it is this long-term procrastination that makes them feel at times like mere spectators in their own lives.
Their frustration does not stem from their inability to achieve their dreams; rather, it arises from their inability to even begin pursuing them.
So after reading these emails, I have come to realize that I believe there are no people who do not procrastinate.
Indeed, I believe everyone is a procrastinator.
You may not be a complete mess like us; perhaps some people can handle deadlines quite well. However, remember this: the monkey's most insidious trick lies in the absence of a deadline.
Now I want to show you one last thing.
I call it the life calendar.
Assuming a person can live to 90 years old, each week is represented by a square.
In fact, there aren't that many squares, especially considering we've already lived for so many years.
I believe we all need to take some time to seriously look at this life calendar.
We need to seriously consider what it is that we are truly procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating on something.
We must always be aware of the existence of the Instant Gratification monkey.
This is something we all should do.
Moreover, because there aren't many slots available, this work should perhaps start today.
Well, maybe not today, but...
You know what I mean.
In the near future.
Thank you.
