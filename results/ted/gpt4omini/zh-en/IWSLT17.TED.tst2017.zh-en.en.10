Hello everyone
My name is Matthew Williams. I am a champion.
I have won medals in three different sports as well as at the Canada Games. I have participated in international-level basketball events, and I feel very proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I train in basketball and speed skating five days a week with top coaches and sports psychologists to maintain my best competitive form.
To add, all of this is due to the Special Olympics.
Does this change your perception of me and my achievements?
This world does not treat everyone like me as a champion.
Not long ago, people like me were not welcomed.
Since the Special Olympics began in 1968, this situation has greatly improved, but in reality, individuals with intellectual disabilities are still often overlooked compared to ordinary people.
People call me "fool" in front of me, thinking I won't care.
They call me "fool," saying I am slow, using it entirely in a derogatory sense.
They don't realize how much this hurts me and my friends.
I don't want you to think that my presence here is to seek pity.
I am here because this issue still exists: many people have problematic views of individuals with intellectual disabilities, or more importantly, many people simply do not acknowledge their existence at all.
You all know that the World Games are being held this year, right?
I am one of the 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities, and we come from 165 countries to compete in Los Angeles.
At that time, over 62,000 spectators watched the opening ceremony, and both TSN and ESPN broadcasted it live.
But do you know about this?
When you see people like me, what do you think?
I came here today to boldly propose that we be treated equally.
The Special Olympics has transformed the self-perception of athletes with intellectual disabilities and changed the views of the audience.
If you are not familiar with the Special Olympics, let me explain: it is established for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
It is independent of the Paralympics and the Olympics.
We have high-quality, year-round sports programs specifically designed for athletes with intellectual disabilities; these programs can change our destinies and the way we are perceived.
The Special Olympics has changed my life, as well as the lives of many others, and it has also transformed the world's perception of individuals with intellectual disabilities.
I was born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability.
Before I turned 12, I played hockey.
The older I get, the more I feel it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with others. I feel angry and frustrated.
For a period of time, I had no involvement in any sports, had very few friends, and felt abandoned, as if no one cared.
There was a time when individuals with intellectual disabilities were isolated from society and not openly acknowledged.
No one would think that they could participate in sports, let alone become valued members of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of normal sports on the health of children with intellectual disabilities.
Dr. Hayden and other researchers reached a conclusion through rigorous scientific studies: the decline in the health of children with intellectual disabilities is solely due to a lack of opportunities for physical activity.
Many people question whether individuals with intellectual disabilities can benefit from sports or athletic competitions.
But it was precisely because of Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of the Special Olympics, who advocated for the benefits of physical activity, that Special Olympics athletes have demonstrated the positive effects of sports over four and a half million times.
Before I participated in the Special Olympics, I was an anxious person because I was young, shy, lacked confidence, and had very few friends.
But when I got there, I found that everyone was very friendly, eager to help, and did not discriminate against me, allowing me to be myself again.
Now, I am a basketball player and a speed skater, having participated in provincial and national competitions, and this year I will compete in the Summer Special Olympics in Los Angeles, where I will represent the first Canadian basketball team at the world games.
I am one of the 4.5 million athletes in the world, and I have also heard many similar stories.
Becoming an athlete in the Special Olympics helps us regain our confidence and dignity.
This event also highlights important health needs.
Research shows that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities live 13 years less than men without intellectual disabilities, while women with intellectual disabilities live 20 years less than women without intellectual disabilities.
The Special Olympics helps us stay healthy and encourages us to actively participate in sports.
Our coaches also teach us about nutrition and health.
The Special Olympics also provides free health screenings for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctors or who struggle to receive health care.
At the 2015 Summer Special Olympics, my teammates from Canada and I competed against the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the competition, the members of the Nigerian basketball team participated in the health screenings provided by the Special Olympics, and 7 out of the 10 athletes received free hearing aids, allowing them to hear more clearly for the first time in their lives.
The changes it brings to them are truly remarkable.
They are more excited, happy, and confident because their coaches can finally communicate with them using language.
They are very easily excited because they can now hear the sound of the basketball, the whistle, and the cheers of the fans standing nearbyâ€”sounds that we take for granted.
The Special Olympics not only transforms them in terms of sports.
It also transforms them in terms of their lives.
This year, research shows that nearly half of adults in the United States do not know a single person with an intellectual disability. Among Americans who have not interacted with individuals with intellectual disabilities, 44% are significantly less tolerant and have a more negative attitude.
The terms that include the word "fool" demonstrate that individuals with intellectual disabilities continue to be overlooked and feel isolated from the world.
People use this term either casually or as an insult.
Last year, it was used over nine million times on Twitter, which deeply hurt me and my 4.5 million fellow athletes in this world.
People do not see this as an insult, but it truly is.
My fellow athlete and global ambassador, Franklin Stephens, wrote a letter to a political commentator who had once used the term "retard" as an insult, saying, "Come and see the Special Olympics one day."
"Do you still hold the same thoughts as you leave?"
This year, at the 2015 Summer Special Olympics, people waited in line for several hours just to watch the final evening of the weightlifting competition.
When my teammate Jackie Barrett took the stage, everyone stood up. He is known as the Newfoundland Moose, and he deadlifted 665 pounds and squatted 611 pounds, setting multiple new records for the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the record holder among weightlifters from Newfoundland, not just in the Special Olympics, but across all weightlifters.
Jackie is now considered a big star in Los Angeles, and ESPN even tweeted in real-time about him breaking the weightlifting records, expressing their astonishment at his performance.
Fifty years ago, hardly anyone could have imagined that individuals with intellectual disabilities could achieve this.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the renowned Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremony of the competition and cheered for the athletes from 165 countries around the world.
We are celebrated and cheered for, no longer hidden away.
The Special Olympics teaches athletes to be more confident and proud of themselves.
The Special Olympics also teaches the world that individuals with intellectual disabilities deserve to be respected and included.
Now, in my athletic career, I have dreams and achievements, receive quality training, gain respect, and lead a healthier life. I am also working towards a career as a personal trainer.
I am no longer hidden away or bullied; I am here at TED giving a TED Talk.
With the Special Olympics, the world has become a different place, but there is still a long way to go.
So the next time you see someone with an intellectual disability, I hope you can see their potential.
The next time someone around you uses the word "fool," I hope you tell them how hurtful that word can be.
I hope you will want to see a Special Olympics event.
I'll share one last thought with everyone.
Nelson Mandela once said, "Sport has the power to change the world."
The Special Olympics is changing the world by transforming the lives of 4.5 million athletes, giving us a place to belong, helping us become confident, make friends, and experience what it feels like to be a champion without facing discrimination.
Thank you, everyone!
