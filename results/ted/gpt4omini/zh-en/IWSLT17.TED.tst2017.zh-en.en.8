When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice issues were at the heart of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
The new government, after emerging from a long independence war, immediately announced a socialist policy: to make health care services and primary education basic free items.
The large-scale rural health service centers allow 80% of the population to reach them within a two-hour walk, marking a truly remarkable progress.
In 1980, the year of Zimbabwe's independence, 25% of children received routine vaccinations.
By 1990, just ten years later, this percentage rose to 80%.
I am deeply honored to be part of this transformation, this revolution.
The excitement and camaraderie are very genuine.
Working shoulder to shoulder with the outstanding people of Zimbabwe—scientists, doctors, and activists—I feel that my involvement is not just in an African independence movement, but also in a progressive global public health movement.
I have also faced some daunting challenges.
In 1985, the year I arrived, Zimbabwe reported its first case of AIDS.
In the early 1980s, I cared for several AIDS patients while I was receiving medical training at Harlem Hospital, but... we could never have imagined what we would encounter in Africa.
When I first arrived there, the infection rate was about 2%.
This proportion rapidly increased. When I left Harare 17 years later, one in four adults was infected.
By the mid-1990s, I had informed hundreds of vibrant young people that their AIDS virus tests were positive.
I witnessed colleagues and friends dying, and my students and hospital patients also died as a result.
Faced with this situation, my colleagues and I opened a clinic.
We demonstrate how to use condoms.
We conduct awareness campaigns in schools and workplaces.
We conduct research and provide advice on how to protect themselves for partners of individuals with AIDS.
We worked very hard to do all of this. I believe that at that time, I had already given my all.
I provided the best treatment options, at least under the conditions at that time.
However, I did not make any constructive changes.
Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan candidly admitted that it was his personal mistake that led to the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was the head of the United Nations peacekeeping department.
At the tenth anniversary commemoration of the genocide, he recalled, "At that time, I believed I had given my all. However, it was only after the genocide that I realized there was much more I could and should do to sound the alarm and seek support."
The outbreak of AIDS caught the medical community off guard. The World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people have died from this disease today. Many, like me, feel regret and sorrow for not having been able to stop it sooner.
But when I was living in Zimbabwe, I did not realize that I was an advocate or a political figure.
I thought it was my medical knowledge that brought me there, due to my clinical and infectious disease research.
I have always felt that my work is to care for patients and to better understand the demographic characteristics of those infected through research, hoping to slow the spread of the virus.
I realized that the proportion of marginalized social groups infected with and dying from AIDS was remarkably high.
In the sugar plantations, which are more akin to feudal estates than modern enterprises, 60% of pregnant women tested positive for the AIDS virus.
My work is to show people that being infected is not a moral failing, but is related to patriarchal attitudes, as well as to the forced labor of migrants and colonialism.
Most white people were safe and sound.
As medical experts, our means are regrettably powerless: we plead with people to change their personal behaviors, use condoms, and reduce the number of partners.
The infection rate continues to rise. While treatment has become feasible in the West, it remains unaffordable for the entire public sector in Africa, which is our most effective weapon against the virus.
I did not boldly state that the inequality in access to life-saving medications, or the issues within the underlying economic and political systems, are the driving forces behind the persistently high infection rates among such a large population.
I made excuses for my silence, reminding myself that I was merely a visitor in this country; sounding the alarm could lead to my expulsion, preventing me from doing my job, caring for my patients, and conducting the urgently needed research.
So I did not boldly speak out about the government's early AIDS policies.
I did not express my concerns loudly enough.
Many doctors and healthcare workers may feel that I did nothing wrong.
Our commitment to patients is as sacred and inviolable as the Hippocratic Oath and its various versions, representing the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship.
I do my utmost for each of my patients.
But I know that the infectious diseases arising alongside our societal divisions reflect not only biological phenomena but, more importantly, the issues of marginalization, exclusion, racism, sexism, and class discrimination.
This is also true for AIDS.
This is also true for the recent Ebola outbreak.
Medical anthropologists, such as Paul Farmer, who work on AIDS in Haiti, refer to it as structural violence: structural because inequality is rooted in the political and economic organization of our social environment, which is often ignored by the privileged and those in power; and violent because its impacts, such as premature death, suffering, and illness, are forms of violence.
We do very little for our patients if we do not recognize these social injustices.
Sounding the alarm is the first step in guiding public health in the right direction; it is our way of seeking support, coming together to break through and create real change.
So now, I do not remain silent.
I speak boldly about many things, even if it makes the listeners uncomfortable, and even if it makes me uncomfortable.
Among these, many pertain to apartheid and organized racism—things that should not occur in this country, nor should they exist in medical practice or public health.
But they do exist, and we pay the price of shortened lives for it.
This is why the impact of racism on healthcare in the United States serves as a wake-up call: the ongoing organized, interpersonal violence against people of color is closely tied to our tragic history—250 years of slavery, 90 years of racial discrimination, and 60 years of imperfect equality. Raising this alarm is the central focus of my work as the Health Commissioner of New York City.
In New York City, the premature mortality rate, defined as dying before the age of 65, is 50% higher for Black individuals compared to White individuals.
In 2012, Black women faced more than ten times the risk of mortality related to childbirth compared to White women.
Despite the significant progress we have made in reducing infant mortality rates, the mortality rate for Black infants in their first year remains nearly three times that of White infants.
New York City is not an exception.
These statistics are similar across the United States.
A recent analysis by The New York Times reports that there are approximately 15 million missing Black men nationwide.
The author points out that among Black men aged 25 to 54, at least one in every six has disappeared from daily life, either due to incarceration or premature death.
Young Black individuals face disproportionately high levels of violence in their daily lives, which is profoundly unjust. These issues are evident in the recent protests that have prominently featured the slogan "Black Lives Matter."
However, we need to remember that the current state and outcomes of general healthcare, along with the persistently high rates of diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and AIDS—those illnesses that slowly and quietly consume lives—are responsible for the premature loss of more Black lives.
As the "Black Lives Matter" movement unfolds, I feel frustrated and angry that the medical community hesitates even to use the term "racism" in their research and work.
Every time I mention it, you probably have a sense of it already.
Medical students, clad in white coats, protested against bioweapons with their deaths; however, the medical community largely stood by as racial discrimination continued to influence disease conditions and mortality rates.
I am very concerned that the trend towards individualization and precision medicine, which seeks biological and genetic targets for better-designed therapies, may inadvertently prevent us from seeing the bigger picture. This bigger picture is precisely the context of everyday life—the places where individuals live, grow, work, and love—which significantly impacts community health. For many of us, poor health is a reality.
In everyday life, as healthcare workers, whether in clinics or conducting research, we are witnesses to immense injustices: the homeless, unable to follow medical advice because they must prioritize more pressing matters; young transgender individuals contemplating suicide due to the cruelty of our society; single mothers feeling compelled to take responsibility for their children's poor health.
As healthcare workers, our role is not only to treat our patients but also to sound the alarm and advocate for change.
Regardless of whether it is reasonable, our societal positions lend credibility to our voices, and we should not waste it.
I regret not being able to express myself candidly in Zimbabwe. I have committed to myself that, as the Health Commissioner of New York City, I will seize every opportunity to sound the alarm and seek support for healthcare equality.
I will speak out against racism, and I hope you will join me, just as I will join you when you speak out against gender discrimination or any form of inequality.
It is time for us to rise up and boldly speak out together against structural inequalities.
In advocating for change, we do not need to have all the answers.
We only need courage.
The health of our patients and our own health depend entirely on this.
