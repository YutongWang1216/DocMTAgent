        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, who majored in Public Administration in college and was accustomed to writing numerous papers, faced a significant challenge when tasked with a 90-page thesis. Recognizing that their typical writing process would not suffice, they devised a plan to gradually increase their workload over the year. However, despite this strategy, the initial months yielded minimal progress, leading to a revision plan to combat procrastination. Ultimately, the author procrastinated until the final three days before the deadline, resulting in a frantic 72-hour writing spree that produced the thesis but resulted in poor quality. They humorously reflect on the disparity between their expectations and the final product. This experience inspired the author to start a blog focused on procrastination, where they aim to explain the mindset of procrastinators and hypothesize that they may have different brain functions compared to non-procrastinators, planning to compare brain scans to explore this further.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, who majored in Public Administration and was experienced in writing, faced a significant challenge when required to complete a 90-page thesis. Recognizing that their usual writing approach would be insufficient, they developed a plan to gradually increase their workload over the year. However, initial progress was minimal, leading to a revision strategy to combat procrastination. Ultimately, they procrastinated until just three days before the deadline, resulting in a frantic 72-hour writing spree that produced a thesis of poor quality. Reflecting humorously on the gap between their expectations and the final product, this experience inspired the author to start a blog about procrastination. In the blog, they hypothesize that procrastinators have different brain functions compared to non-procrastinators, specifically noting that procrastinators possess an \"Instant Gratification monkey\" that disrupts rational decision-making. While both types of brains include a rational decision-maker, the monkey in procrastinators prioritizes immediate pleasure, leading to distractions like internet browsing and a lack of awareness of past or future consequences, ultimately resulting in procrastination and difficulty focusing on tasks. The author plans to compare brain scans to explore these differences further.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, who majored in Public Administration and had writing experience, faced a significant challenge in completing a 90-page thesis. Acknowledging that their usual writing approach was insufficient, they devised a plan to gradually increase their workload over the year. However, initial progress was minimal, leading to a revision strategy to combat procrastination. Ultimately, they procrastinated until just three days before the deadline, resulting in a frantic 72-hour writing spree that produced a thesis of poor quality. Reflecting humorously on the gap between their expectations and the final product, this experience inspired the author to start a blog about procrastination. In the blog, they hypothesize that procrastinators have different brain functions compared to non-procrastinators, specifically noting the presence of an \"Instant Gratification monkey\" that disrupts rational decision-making. This conflict between the desire for immediate gratification and the rational decision-maker often leads procrastinators to spend time in the \"dark playground,\" engaging in enjoyable but ultimately meaningless activities instead of pursuing more significant tasks. The author plans to compare brain scans to explore these differences further, emphasizing the need for modern civilization to plan for the future and engage in meaningful activities beyond basic survival.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, who majored in Public Administration and had writing experience, faced a significant challenge in completing a 90-page thesis. Realizing their usual writing approach was insufficient, they devised a plan to gradually increase their workload over the year. However, initial progress was minimal, leading to a revision strategy to combat procrastination. Ultimately, they procrastinated until just three days before the deadline, resulting in a frantic 72-hour writing spree that produced a thesis of poor quality. Reflecting humorously on the gap between their expectations and the final product, this experience inspired the author to start a blog about procrastination. In the blog, they hypothesize that procrastinators have different brain functions compared to non-procrastinators, noting the presence of an \"Instant Gratification monkey\" that disrupts rational decision-making. This conflict leads procrastinators to spend time in the \"dark playground,\" engaging in enjoyable but ultimately meaningless activities instead of pursuing more significant tasks, which can result in guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-loathing. Procrastinators struggle to move toward the productive \"blue zone,\" where important tasks await, often driven by the \"Panic Monster,\" which awakens when deadlines loom or when facing potential embarrassment or disaster. The author shares a personal experience of being invited to give a TED talk, which initially excited them but led to procrastination. As the event approached, the Panic Monster awakened, causing chaos and ultimately allowing the rational part of the author to take control and begin preparing for the presentation. The author plans to compare brain scans to explore these differences further, emphasizing the need for modern civilization to plan for the future and engage in meaningful activities beyond basic survival.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, who majored in Public Administration and had writing experience, faced a significant challenge in completing a 90-page thesis. Realizing their usual writing approach was insufficient, they devised a plan to gradually increase their workload over the year. However, initial progress was minimal, leading to a revision strategy to combat procrastination. Ultimately, they procrastinated until just three days before the deadline, resulting in a frantic 72-hour writing spree that produced a thesis of poor quality. Reflecting humorously on the gap between their expectations and the final product, this experience inspired the author to start a blog about procrastination. In the blog, which garnered thousands of responses worldwide, they hypothesize that procrastinators have different brain functions compared to non-procrastinators, identifying the presence of an \"Instant Gratification monkey\" that disrupts rational decision-making. This conflict leads procrastinators to spend time in the \"dark playground,\" engaging in enjoyable but ultimately meaningless activities instead of pursuing more significant tasks, resulting in guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-loathing. They struggle to move toward the productive \"blue zone,\" often driven by the \"Panic Monster,\" which awakens when deadlines loom or when facing potential embarrassment or disaster. The author shares a personal experience of being invited to give a TED talk, which initially excited them but led to procrastination. As the event approached, the Panic Monster emerged, causing chaos and ultimately allowing the rational part of the author to take control and begin preparing for the presentation. The author notes two types of procrastination: one with deadlines, where the Panic Monster intervenes, and another without deadlines, such as pursuing personal goals or relationships, where procrastination can continue indefinitely due to the absence of urgency. They plan to compare brain scans to explore these differences further, emphasizing the need for modern civilization to plan for the future and engage in meaningful activities beyond basic survival.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, who majored in Public Administration and had writing experience, faced a significant challenge in completing a 90-page thesis. Realizing their usual writing approach was insufficient, they devised a plan to gradually increase their workload over the year. However, initial progress was minimal, leading to a revision strategy to combat procrastination. Ultimately, they procrastinated until just three days before the deadline, resulting in a frantic 72-hour writing spree that produced a thesis of poor quality. Reflecting humorously on the gap between their expectations and the final product, this experience inspired the author to start a blog about procrastination, which garnered thousands of responses worldwide. They hypothesize that procrastinators have different brain functions compared to non-procrastinators, identifying the presence of an \"Instant Gratification monkey\" that disrupts rational decision-making and leads to spending time in the \"dark playground\" of enjoyable but meaningless activities. This results in guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-loathing, as they struggle to move toward the productive \"blue zone,\" often driven by the \"Panic Monster,\" which awakens when deadlines loom. The author shares a personal experience of being invited to give a TED talk, which initially excited them but led to procrastination until the Panic Monster emerged, causing chaos and ultimately allowing them to prepare for the presentation. They note two types of procrastination: deadline-based, where the Panic Monster intervenes, and long-term procrastination without deadlines, which can lead to significant unhappiness and guilt, making individuals feel like spectators in their own lives. The frustration arises not from a failure to achieve dreams but from an inability to start pursuing them. The author emphasizes the importance of recognizing this tendency, particularly through the metaphor of a \"life calendar,\" which illustrates our limited time. They encourage readers to reflect on what they are procrastinating about and confront the challenge posed by the \"Instant Gratification monkey,\" suggesting that action should begin soon. The author also plans to compare brain scans to explore these differences further, emphasizing the need for modern civilization to plan for the future and engage in meaningful activities beyond basic survival.",
