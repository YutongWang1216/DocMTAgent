Surrounded by a crowded congregation, he feels a mix of fear and responsibility, anxious about being left behind due to his past actions. He recalls a plan from the book \"Left Behind,\" which outlines how to avoid being deemed a heretic and face various apocalyptic challenges if not taken away. As the countdown to midnight approaches, the pastor leads the congregation to pray at the altar, highlighting the social dynamics within the church, including the presence of a \"Baptist bourgeoisie\" in the front row. The narrator also reflects on the older generation of East Texas, whose hard lives in cotton fields shaped their dreams and aspirations, idolizing them and comparing their longings to those of medieval ancestors and their grandmother's anticipation for \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\" While accompanying their grandmother to prayer, they hold her hand tightly, believing their connection might lead them to heaven. Amidst the fervent prayers and emotional responses, the narrator feels a mix of hope and anger as they witness the elder congregants' unwavering faith despite the absence of divine intervention, grappling with feelings of deception and struggling against personal desires while engaging in the communal prayers.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "On December 31, 1999, a 12-year-old reflects on a tense night spent in a Texas church, filled with a sense of impending doom as he believes Christ will return, marking the end of the world. Surrounded by a crowded congregation, he feels a mix of fear and responsibility, anxious about being left behind due to his past actions. He recalls a plan from the book \"Left Behind,\" which outlines how to avoid being deemed a heretic and face various apocalyptic challenges if not taken away. As the countdown to midnight approaches, the pastor leads the congregation to pray at the altar, highlighting the social dynamics within the church, including the presence of a \"Baptist bourgeoisie\" in the front row. The narrator also reflects on the older generation of East Texas, whose hard lives in cotton fields shaped their dreams and aspirations, idolizing them and comparing their longings to those of medieval ancestors and their grandmother's anticipation for \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\" While accompanying their grandmother to prayer, they hold her hand tightly, believing their connection might lead them to heaven. Amidst the fervent prayers and emotional responses, the narrator feels a mix of hope and anger as they witness the elder congregants' unwavering faith despite the absence of divine intervention, grappling with feelings of deception and struggling against personal desires while engaging in the communal prayers.\n\nYears later, the narrator reflects on their journey of faith and doubt, having experienced deep disillusionment after that pivotal night at church when they felt abandoned by their Savior. They recount significant moments in their life, including watching the New Year celebration on television, arriving at Yale University seeking escape from past hardships, enduring a harrowing experience during a robbery, and interning at Lehman Brothers during its financial collapse. Despite moments of hope, such as the excitement of political change during Obama's campaign, they ultimately realize that neither education, job success, nor political movements can provide salvation or answers to their struggles.

        "new_tgt_summary": "On December 31, 1999, a 12-year-old reflects on a tense night spent in a Texas church, filled with a sense of impending doom as he believes Christ will return, marking the end of the world. Surrounded by a crowded congregation, he feels a mix of fear and responsibility, anxious about being left behind due to his past actions. He recalls a plan from the book \"Left Behind,\" which outlines how to avoid being deemed a heretic and face various apocalyptic challenges if not taken away. As the countdown to midnight approaches, the pastor leads the congregation to pray at the altar, revealing the social dynamics within the church, including the presence of a \"Baptist bourgeoisie\" in the front row. The narrator idolizes the older generation of East Texas, whose hard lives shaped their dreams, and compares their longings to those of medieval ancestors and his grandmother's anticipation for \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\" Holding his grandmother's hand tightly during prayer, he believes their connection might lead them to heaven. Amidst the fervent prayers and emotional responses, he grapples with feelings of hope and anger, witnessing the elder congregants' unwavering faith despite the absence of divine intervention, while struggling against personal desires.\n\nYears later, the narrator reflects on their journey of faith and doubt, having experienced disillusionment after that pivotal night at church when they felt abandoned by their Savior. Significant moments in their life, such as watching New Year celebrations on television, arriving at Yale University to escape past hardships, enduring a robbery, and interning at Lehman Brothers during its financial collapse, shape their perspective. Despite moments of hope, including the excitement of political change during Obama's campaign, they realize that neither education, job success, nor political movements can provide salvation or answers to their struggles. Acknowledging that doubt is also a valid perspective, the narrator further reflects on their pursuit of the American Dream, recognizing the disillusionment with its myths while maintaining hope through faith. This journey leads them to Harvard Business School, where they understand the need for personal action rather than passive acceptance. Inspired by a spontaneous road trip with friends in 2013, they travel 13,000 kilometers across America, engaging with small businesses and discovering a shared desire among their generation for meaningful goals. This experience culminates in the creation of a nonprofit organization, \"Master of Industrial Management Traveling Across America,\" aimed at supporting entrepreneurs. At a Harvard Business School alumni dinner, they reflect on the stark contrast between their grassroots efforts and the immense wealth of influential figures in attendance, highlighting the complexities of ambition and success while emphasizing their commitment to promoting initiatives that help heal the nation through small businesses.",

        "new_src_summary": "该文段结合了两位作者的内心挣扎与成长经历，同时探讨了社会不平等和个人责任感。首先，描述了一位12岁少年在1999年12月31日于德克萨斯州教堂内的感受，他面对基督复临的悬疑与对救赎的渴望，回忆起教堂的紧张氛围与对末日的恐惧，内心在信仰与责任之间挣扎。与此同时，东德州的老一辈人在艰苦的棉花田中劳作，体现出坚韧与希望，作者对他们的崇敬之情溢于言表，尤其是对祖母的信仰渴望与祷告的回忆，尽管长辈们的信仰未得到回应，作者却感到愤怒与困惑，努力抵抗内心的怀疑，展现了对信仰、梦想与现实的深刻思考。\n\n接着，作者在追求“美国梦”的过程中经历了内心的挣扎，最初祈求成功与金钱，但逐渐意识到这些追求的虚幻与短暂。通过自驾游的经历，作者与朋友们深入美国各地，发现了许多渴望实现人生价值的创业者，并推动了“工管硕士走遍美国”非营利组织的成立，以帮助小型企业与创业者。与此同时，作者在纽约哈林区的城市农场见证托尼为贫困儿童提供每日一餐的经历，反映出社会资源的匮乏和贫困的现实，感受到自身特权与他人困境之间的强烈对比，意识到个人参与的改变只是微不足道的修补，真正需要的是系统性的变革。整体而言，文段通过个人回忆与反思，融合了对信仰、希望与失落的探讨，风格抒情，语气反思与激励并存，展现出一种无奈而又顽强的探索精神，同时也揭示了个人在面对集体苦难时的无力感与羞耻感，强调了信仰与希望在困境中的重要性。",
        "new_tgt_summary": "On December 31, 1999, a 12-year-old reflects on a tense night spent in a Texas church, filled with a sense of impending doom as he believes Christ will return, marking the end of the world. Surrounded by a crowded congregation, he feels a mix of fear and responsibility, anxious about being left behind due to his past actions. He recalls a plan from the book \"Left Behind,\" which outlines how to avoid being deemed a heretic and face various apocalyptic challenges if not taken away. As the countdown to midnight approaches, the pastor leads the congregation to pray at the altar, revealing the social dynamics within the church, including the presence of a \"Baptist bourgeoisie\" in the front row. The narrator idolizes the older generation of East Texas, whose hard lives shaped their dreams, and compares their longings to those of medieval ancestors and his grandmother's anticipation for \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\" Holding his grandmother's hand tightly during prayer, he believes their connection might lead them to heaven. Amidst the fervent prayers and emotional responses, he grapples with feelings of hope and anger, witnessing the elder congregants' unwavering faith despite the absence of divine intervention, while struggling against personal desires.\n\nYears later, the narrator reflects on their journey of faith and doubt, having experienced disillusionment after that pivotal night at church when they felt abandoned by their Savior. Significant moments in their life, such as watching New Year celebrations on television, arriving at Yale University to escape past hardships, enduring a robbery, and interning at Lehman Brothers during its financial collapse, shape their perspective. Despite moments of hope, including the excitement of political change during Obama's campaign, they realize that neither education, job success, nor political movements can provide salvation or answers to their struggles. Acknowledging that doubt is also a valid perspective, the narrator further reflects on their pursuit of the American Dream, recognizing the disillusionment with its myths while maintaining hope through faith. This journey leads them to Harvard Business School, where they understand the need for personal action rather than passive acceptance. Inspired by a spontaneous road trip with friends in 2013, they travel 13,000 kilometers across America, engaging with small businesses and discovering a shared desire among their generation for meaningful goals, culminating in the creation of a nonprofit organization, \"Master of Industrial Management Traveling Across America,\" aimed at supporting entrepreneurs.\n\nThe narrator also reflects on the stark contrast between their privileged discussions about a better world and the harsh realities faced by impoverished children in Harlem, who rely on a local urban farm, \"Harlem Grown,\" for food. Funded entirely by Tony, a former taxi driver, the farm serves as a vital resource for those living below the poverty line. The narrator feels a deep sense of inspiration and sorrow upon realizing that despite their efforts to help, systemic support is lacking in areas like Harlem and beyond. This revelation leads to feelings of shame, as the narrator acknowledges their own role in perpetuating the cycle of inequality. They recognize the need for a fundamental transformation in society rather than just minor repairs, while also reflecting on their personal journey and the enduring nature of belief in the face of suffering, emphasizing their commitment to promoting initiatives that help heal the nation through small businesses.",
