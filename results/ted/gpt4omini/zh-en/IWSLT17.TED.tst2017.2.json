        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, raised in the free and tolerant city of Seattle, Washington, comes from a supportive family with an artist mother and a university professor father. Grateful for their upbringing, he pursued his dream of becoming a professional French horn player, despite dropping out of college at 19. He toured the U.S. and Europe, performing with jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd and later joined the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra. His parents, although concerned about his unconventional path, have always supported him. During a visit home at 27, the author sensed his mother's unease and learned that she and his father were worried about his future. Additionally, the narrator reflects on their lack of interest in politics, particularly when asked if they voted for the Republican Party, and how their journey to becoming an enthusiastic supporter of capitalism began with childhood exposure to poverty. At six or seven, they were deeply impacted by a National Geographic photo of a malnourished child from East Africa, which made them feel powerless and prompted them to question the fate of impoverished children worldwide. This concern has driven them to explore whether the situation for the poorest people has improved or worsened over time, even after dropping out of college.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, raised in the free and tolerant city of Seattle, Washington, comes from a supportive family with an artist mother and a university professor father. Grateful for their upbringing, he pursued his dream of becoming a professional French horn player, despite dropping out of college at 19. He toured the U.S. and Europe, performing with jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd and later joined the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra. His parents, although concerned about his unconventional path, have always supported him. During a visit home at 27, the author sensed his mother's unease and learned that she and his father were worried about his future. Reflecting on his lack of interest in politics, particularly regarding the Republican Party, he recounts how his journey to becoming an enthusiastic supporter of capitalism began with childhood exposure to poverty. A National Geographic photo of a malnourished child from East Africa profoundly impacted him at six or seven, prompting him to question the fate of impoverished children worldwide. This concern has driven him to explore whether the situation for the poorest people has improved or worsened over time. He shares a transformative realization about global poverty, noting that while many Americans believe poverty has worsened since the 1970s, the percentage of the world's population living on less than $1 a day has actually decreased by 80% within his lifetime. The author considers this reduction a miracle and a major achievement in the fight against poverty, emphasizing the importance of understanding the reasons behind this success to replicate it and help the remaining 200 million people still living in poverty. He expresses a desire to seek insights from various economists, regardless of their political affiliations, to find effective solutions.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, raised in the free and tolerant city of Seattle, Washington, comes from a supportive family with an artist mother and a university professor father. Grateful for their upbringing, he pursued his dream of becoming a professional French horn player, despite dropping out of college at 19. He toured the U.S. and Europe, performing with jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd and later joined the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra. His parents, although concerned about his unconventional path, have always supported him. During a visit home at 27, he sensed his mother's unease and learned that his parents were worried about his future. Reflecting on his lack of interest in politics, particularly regarding the Republican Party, he recounts how his journey to becoming an enthusiastic supporter of capitalism began with childhood exposure to poverty. A National Geographic photo of a malnourished child from East Africa profoundly impacted him at six or seven, prompting him to question the fate of impoverished children worldwide. This concern has driven him to explore whether the situation for the poorest people has improved or worsened over time. He shares a transformative realization about global poverty, noting that while many Americans believe poverty has worsened since the 1970s, the percentage of the world's population living on less than $1 a day has actually decreased by 80% within his lifetime, which he considers a miracle and a major achievement in the fight against poverty. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the reasons behind this success to replicate it and help the remaining 200 million people still living in poverty. The author highlights that 2 billion people have escaped poverty due to five key factors: globalization, free trade, property rights, rule of law, and entrepreneurship, all facilitated by the global free market system that emerged after 1970. While acknowledging the imperfections of the free market, he emphasizes its effectiveness and its connection to human ambition and dreams, urging the importance of understanding this system to promote global and national development. He expresses a desire to seek insights from various economists, regardless of their political affiliations, to find effective solutions.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, raised in the free and tolerant city of Seattle, Washington, comes from a supportive family with an artist mother and a university professor father. Grateful for their upbringing, he pursued his dream of becoming a professional French horn player, despite dropping out of college at 19. He toured the U.S. and Europe, performing with jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd and later joined the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra. Although his parents were concerned about his unconventional path, they have always supported him. During a visit home at 27, he sensed his mother's unease and learned that his parents were worried about his future. Reflecting on his lack of interest in politics, particularly regarding the Republican Party, he recounts how his journey to becoming an enthusiastic supporter of capitalism began with childhood exposure to poverty, sparked by a National Geographic photo of a malnourished child from East Africa. This concern has driven him to explore whether the situation for the poorest people has improved or worsened over time, leading to a transformative realization that the percentage of the world's population living on less than $1 a day has decreased by 80% within his lifetime—a miracle he attributes to globalization, free trade, property rights, rule of law, and entrepreneurship, all facilitated by the global free market system that emerged after 1970. He emphasizes the importance of understanding this success to replicate it and help the remaining 200 million people still living in poverty, urging insights from various economists to find effective solutions. Additionally, the author reflects on a vivid memory from May 2015, discussing political divisions at an event at Georgetown University, where he emphasized the importance of dialogue between liberals and conservatives to address pressing issues in the U.S. and globally. He expressed optimism about the opportunity for dialogue, despite the ongoing political crisis, and referenced a 2014 article that explores the asymmetry of political motivations, highlighting how individuals often perceive their beliefs as stemming from love while viewing opposing beliefs as rooted in hate—a phenomenon evident in global conflicts like the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.",

        "new_src_summary": "该文段结合了作者在美国西雅图成长的经历与对全球贫困问题的深刻关注，强调家庭支持与个人追求之间的矛盾。作者的母亲是一位艺术家，父亲是一名大学教授，他们给予了作者自由发展的空间。然而，作者在19岁时选择辍学，追求成为专业法国号手的梦想，并在全美和欧洲进行演出，甚至加入了巴塞罗那交响乐团。尽管父母对这一选择并不认同，但始终给予支持。文中提到了一次尴尬的对话，反映出父母对作者未来的担忧。同时，作者通过与朋友的对话探讨对贫穷的关注与对政治和社会问题的思考，揭示了对资本主义的热情与对贫穷研究的根源。童年时在《国家地理》上看到的一幅描绘东非儿童贫困的图画深深影响了他，使他对世界其他地区的贫穷状况产生了浓厚的兴趣。作者分享了自己对贫困现象的认知转变，指出自1970年以来，生活费不足1美元的人口比例下降了80%，这一数据令他感到震惊，并认为这是人类历史上反贫困的重大成就。他希望了解导致这一变化的原因，以便帮助仍在贫困中的2亿人脱离困境，并强调自己并不关心政治因素，而是寻求来自各派经济学家的最佳答案。\n\n此外，作者讨论了20亿人民脱离贫困的五个主要原因，分别是全球化、自由贸易、产权、法治和企业家精神，强调这些因素是自由市场经济体系在1970年后发展的结果。虽然承认自由市场经济并不完美，作者认为它在促进财富创造和改善人类生活方面具有重要意义，超越了政治的局限，并强调资本主义与抱负和梦想的关系，呼吁更多人理解这一点。最后，作者引用名言总结了自由市场在消除贫困方面的巨大贡献。整体而言，该文段涉及个人成长、家庭关系及社会经济领域，风格亲切而叙述性，同时又理性且具说服力，语气中带有感激、反思与探索的情感，以及坚定而富有激情的呼吁，传达出作者对贫穷现象的关切与求知欲。\n\n与此同时，文章探讨了美国总统奥巴马在2015年乔治城大学活动中提出的解决美国及全球政治分歧问题的思路，强调自由主义者和保守主义者应聚集讨论，以帮助最需要帮助的人。当前美国及其他国家面临的政治危机非常严峻，心理学家指出，思想观念的对立常常源于爱与恨的非对称关系，尤其在巴勒斯坦与以色列的争端中体现得尤为明显。此外，文段还探讨了当今美国共和党人与民主党人之间的政治动因分歧，指出大多数人声称自己是出于仁爱，而另一部分人则被视为邪恶。作者认为，这种分歧使社会难以进步，强调必须诚实面对这一现实。引用心理学教授乔纳森·海特的研究，文章阐明了保守派与自由派在价值观上的显著差异，例如自由主义者更关注贫穷，而保守主义者则更重视经济自由。尽管存在不可调和的分歧，作者提出这种差异实际上是社会的力量所在。整体上，文段涉及政治与社会心理学领域，风格理性而深入，语气严肃而反思。",
        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, raised in the supportive and tolerant environment of Seattle, Washington, pursued his dream of becoming a professional French horn player despite dropping out of college at 19. He toured the U.S. and Europe, performing with jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd and later joined the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra, all while his concerned parents supported his unconventional path. A pivotal moment in his life came when he recognized his parents' worries about his future during a visit home at 27, prompting him to reflect on his lack of political engagement. His journey towards becoming an enthusiastic supporter of capitalism began with a childhood exposure to poverty, ignited by a National Geographic photo of a malnourished child from East Africa. This concern has driven him to explore whether the situation for the poorest has improved, leading to a transformative realization that the percentage of the world's population living on less than $1 a day has decreased by 80% within his lifetime, a change he attributes to globalization, free trade, property rights, rule of law, and entrepreneurship facilitated by the global free market system that emerged post-1970. He emphasizes the importance of understanding this success to replicate it and assist the remaining 200 million people still in poverty, advocating for insights from various economists to find effective solutions. Additionally, the author reflects on a vivid memory from May 2015, discussing political divisions at a Georgetown University event, where he highlighted the importance of dialogue between liberals and conservatives to tackle pressing societal issues, including poverty. He points out that many Republicans and Democrats are motivated by opposing forces of love and hate, leading to deep societal divisions that hinder progress. Research by psychologist Jonathan Haidt reveals that liberals prioritize poverty, while conservatives focus on economic freedom, suggesting that acknowledging these differences can be a source of strength in addressing societal challenges. Despite the ongoing political crisis, the author expresses optimism about the potential for dialogue to bridge divides and foster understanding.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, raised in the supportive and tolerant environment of Seattle, Washington, pursued his dream of becoming a professional French horn player despite dropping out of college at 19. He toured the U.S. and Europe, performing with jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd and later joined the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra, all while his concerned parents supported his unconventional path. A pivotal moment in his life came when he recognized his parents' worries about his future during a visit home at 27, prompting him to reflect on his lack of political engagement. His journey towards becoming an enthusiastic supporter of capitalism began with childhood exposure to poverty, ignited by a National Geographic photo of a malnourished child from East Africa. This concern has driven him to explore whether the situation for the poorest has improved, leading to a transformative realization that the percentage of the world's population living on less than $1 a day has decreased by 80% within his lifetime, a change he attributes to globalization, free trade, property rights, rule of law, and entrepreneurship facilitated by the global free market system that emerged post-1970. He emphasizes the importance of understanding this success to replicate it and assist the remaining 200 million people still in poverty, advocating for insights from various economists to find effective solutions. Additionally, he reflects on a vivid memory from May 2015, discussing political divisions at a Georgetown University event, where he highlighted the importance of dialogue between liberals and conservatives to tackle pressing societal issues, including poverty. He points out that many Republicans and Democrats are motivated by opposing forces of love and hate, leading to deep societal divisions that hinder progress. Research by psychologist Jonathan Haidt reveals that liberals prioritize poverty, while conservatives focus on economic freedom, suggesting that acknowledging these differences can be a source of strength in addressing societal challenges. The author calls for innovative thinking and social entrepreneurship to invest in sustainable and ethical practices, urging more flexible thinking and cautioning against predictable and conformist thought patterns. Despite the ongoing political crisis, he expresses optimism about the potential for dialogue to bridge divides and foster understanding, emphasizing the urgent need to help an additional 200 million people escape poverty within the context of the global economic order.",

        "new_src_summary": "该文段结合了作者在美国西雅图成长的经历与对全球贫困问题的深刻关注，强调家庭支持与个人追求之间的矛盾。作者的母亲是一位艺术家，父亲是一名大学教授，他们给予了作者自由发展的空间。然而，作者在19岁时选择辍学，追求成为专业法国号手的梦想，并在全美和欧洲进行演出，甚至加入了巴塞罗那交响乐团。尽管父母对这一选择并不认同，但始终给予支持。文中提到了一次尴尬的对话，反映出父母对作者未来的担忧。同时，作者通过与朋友的对话探讨对贫穷的关注与对政治和社会问题的思考，揭示了对资本主义的热情与对贫穷研究的根源。童年时在《国家地理》上看到的一幅描绘东非儿童贫困的图画深深影响了他，使他对世界其他地区的贫穷状况产生了浓厚的兴趣。作者分享了自己对贫困现象的认知转变，指出自1970年以来，生活费不足1美元的人口比例下降了80%，这一数据令他感到震惊，并认为这是人类历史上反贫困的重大成就。他希望了解导致这一变化的原因，以便帮助仍在贫困中的2亿人脱离困境，并强调自己并不关心政治因素，而是寻求来自各派经济学家的最佳答案。\n\n此外，作者讨论了20亿人民脱离贫困的五个主要原因，分别是全球化、自由贸易、产权、法治和企业家精神，强调这些因素是自由市场经济体系在1970年后发展的结果。虽然承认自由市场经济并不完美，作者认为它在促进财富创造和改善人类生活方面具有重要意义，超越了政治的局限，并强调资本主义与抱负和梦想的关系，呼吁更多人理解这一点。文章同时探讨了美国总统奥巴马在2015年乔治城大学活动中提出的解决美国及全球政治分歧问题的思路，强调自由主义者和保守主义者应聚集讨论，以帮助最需要帮助的人。当前美国及其他国家面临的政治危机非常严峻，心理学家指出，思想观念的对立常常源于爱与恨的非对称关系，尤其在巴勒斯坦与以色列的争端中体现得尤为明显。文段还探讨了当今美国共和党人与民主党人之间的政治动因分歧，指出大多数人声称自己是出于仁爱，而另一部分人则被视为邪恶。作者认为，这种分歧使社会难以进步，强调必须诚实面对这一现实。引用心理学教授乔纳森·海特的研究，文章阐明了保守派与自由派在价值观上的显著差异，例如自由主义者更关注贫穷，而保守主义者则更重视经济自由。尽管存在不可调和的分歧，作者提出这种差异实际上是社会的力量所在。\n\n在此背景下，文段进一步探讨了在应对贫困问题时，保守派与自由派之间的合作与团结的重要性。作者强调，尽管个人的观点和立场各异，但在帮助那些正在挨饿的人时，这些分歧不应成为障碍。为了有效减少贫困，保守派需要意识到自由主义者对贫穷的关注，而自由主义者也需重视保守派对自由市场的重视。作者提出了两条行动准则：首先，单纯容忍不同意见是不够的，我们应主动与持不同观点的人合作；其次，无论是保守派还是自由派，都应在自己的立场中融入对贫困问题的关注，成为模糊界限的个体。整体而言，该文段涉及个人成长、家庭关系、社会经济及政治领域，风格亲切而叙述性，同时又理性且具说服力，语气中带有感激、反思与探索的情感，以及呼吁和警示的情感，传达出作者对贫穷现象的关切与求知欲，促使人们共同努力解决社会问题。",
        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, raised in the supportive and tolerant environment of Seattle, pursued his dream of becoming a professional French horn player despite dropping out of college at 19, touring the U.S. and Europe and performing with jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd before joining the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra. His concerned parents supported his unconventional path, and a pivotal moment came at age 27 when he recognized their worries about his future, prompting reflection on his lack of political engagement. This journey led him to become an enthusiastic supporter of capitalism, fueled by childhood exposure to poverty and a transformative realization that the percentage of the world's population living on less than $1 a day has decreased by 80% within his lifetime, largely due to globalization, free trade, property rights, rule of law, and entrepreneurship. He emphasizes the importance of understanding this success to replicate it and assist the remaining 200 million people still in poverty, advocating for insights from various economists to find effective solutions. In May 2015, he highlighted the need for dialogue between liberals and conservatives to address pressing societal issues, including poverty, pointing out that deep societal divisions hinder progress. Research by psychologist Jonathan Haidt indicates that liberals prioritize poverty while conservatives focus on economic freedom, suggesting that recognizing these differences can strengthen collaborative efforts. The author calls for innovative thinking and social entrepreneurship to promote sustainable and ethical practices, urging tolerance and understanding of differing opinions. He believes that by blending ideologies and working together, conservatives and liberals can effectively help those in need and bridge societal divides, ultimately emphasizing the urgent need to assist an additional 200 million people in escaping poverty within the context of the global economic order.",
