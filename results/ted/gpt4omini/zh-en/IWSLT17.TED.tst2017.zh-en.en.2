I come from one of the most free, tolerant, and promising cities in the United States, Seattle, Washington.
I grew up in a wonderful Seattle family.
My mother is an artist, and my father is a university professor. I am deeply grateful for their upbringing, as it has allowed me to freely plan my life in the way I see fit.
In reality, my choices are quite different from what my parents had in mind.
When I was 19 years old, I dropped out of college—or more accurately, I was expelled.
I embarked on the path to becoming a professional French horn player, which has been my lifelong dream.
I performed chamber music across the United States and Europe, touring for several years alongside the outstanding jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd.
In my twenties, I was thrilled to join the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a wonderful life it is!
Moreover, my parents have never complained.
They have supported me all the way through.
Even if it is not their dream.
They used to tell the neighbors and friends, "Our son is going to take a 'break' for ten years."
And there’s an awkward conversation about my life that I want to share with you all.
At that time, I was 27 years old. I returned home from Barcelona on Christmas Day to visit my parents, and while I was helping my mother prepare dinner, there were just the two of us in the kitchen.
She remained silent at that time, not saying a word.
I feel that something is not right.
I then asked my mother, "Mom, what are you thinking about?"
She said, "Your dad and I are really worried about you."
I was very surprised: "What? What is there for you to worry about now?"
She replied, "I hope you answer my question honestly: Did you vote for the Republican Party?"
The fact is, I have no interest in politics; I'm just a French horn player.
But I began to understand a bit; they had sensed something, which left them somewhat confused.
At that time, I became an enthusiastic supporter of capitalism; let me tell you why.
Believe it or not, it stems from my long-standing study of poverty.
When I was a child in Seattle, I remember that it was the first time I encountered real poverty.
My family belonged to the lower middle class, but that was certainly not real poverty.
Not at all.
The first time I saw the true face of poverty was in the early 1970s when I was only six or seven years old.
Like many of us, this example is quite ordinary.
It was a picture in National Geographic, depicting a child from a country in East Africa, about my age, with flies buzzing around his face and a swollen belly.
I knew he couldn't hold on any longer; I knew it, yet I felt powerless.
Some of you may remember a picture like that, not exactly the same, but very similar.
It showcased to the Western world the unbearable poverty found in other parts of the globe.
That imagery lingered in my mind, accompanying me through my growth, schooling, dropping out, and the beginning of my own family.
I wonder how that child turned out later.
Or what about people like him in other parts of the world?
I began to explore this question, and even though I was no longer in college at the time, I was still searching for answers: what has happened to the poorest people in the world?
Has it gotten worse, or has it gotten better? What has really happened?
I ultimately found the answer, which changed my life. I want to share it with you.
In fact, most Americans feel that since their childhood, from the time they first saw that imagery,
Poverty has worsened. If you ask Americans, "Has the issue of global poverty become more severe or has it improved?" 70% would say that the hunger problem has worsened since the early 1970s.
However, the reality is this.
This was a moment that changed my perspective and led to my epiphany.
Since 1970, the percentage of the world's population living on less than $1 a day, adjusted for inflation, has decreased by 80%.
Since my childhood, the percentage of the world's poorest people has decreased by 80%.
Yet I am unaware of this fact.
My friends, this is a miracle!
This is something worth celebrating.
This is the greatest achievement in the history of humanity in the fight against poverty, and it has occurred within our lifetime.
When I learned this fact, I wondered, what has made poverty alleviation possible?
Because if you do not understand the reasons, it will only be a fleeting moment.
We need to replicate success and help the 200 million people who are still struggling in poverty to break free from their situation, because that is the issue we have always been discussing: since I was a child, 2 billion of the poorest people, our brothers and sisters, have escaped poverty.
I hope to save the remaining 2 billion people, so I must understand the reasons.
I am in search of answers,
It is not a political answer, because I do not care about political solutions at all.
I still do not care.
I yearn to receive the best answers from mainstream economists, whether they are leftist, rightist, or centrist economists.
Below
I began to explain the specific reasons.
From my childhood to now, 2 billion people have escaped poverty.
There are five reasons. First: globalization.
Second: free trade.
Third: property rights.
Fourth: rule of law.
Fifth: entrepreneurship.
These are facilitated by the global free market economic system that swept across the world after 1970.
I am not naive.
I know that the free market economy is not perfect, and I also understand that it cannot meet all our needs for building a better world.
But it is great.
And it transcends politics.
This is one point I have learned and come to realize.
Capitalism is not just the accumulation of capital.
Its greatness lies in the fact that it is related to ambition, something that many on this stage have spoken about, an ambition born from dreams, rooted in the free market system.
We must help more people understand this.
Now, I want to talk about my second realization, which is related to the first. I believe it will not only promote the development of the world but also the development of our country.
To summarize the earlier point about lifting people out of poverty in someone else's words: "The free market has created more wealth than ever in history."
"and have lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty."
Whose quote is it?
"Such as Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan."
Wrong!
It's President Obama!
Why do I remember it so vividly?
Because he was the one I was talking about.
You wouldn't have guessed, would you?
I said at the time, "Hallelujah!"
Not only that, I also said, "What a wonderful opportunity."
Do you know what I was thinking at the time?
In May 2015, we held an event at Georgetown University regarding the topics we were working on.
At that time, I thought of a solution to the biggest problem facing the United States today. What was it?
"Whether they are liberals or conservatives, coming together to discuss these ideas helps those who need our assistance the most."
There is no need for me to say it; everyone present knows that we are in a crisis, both in the United States and in other countries around the world with political divisions.
This issue is already pressing.
This inevitably raises great concern.
Last year, an article was published in one of the most influential and cutting-edge scientific journals in the West, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
That was an article from 2014 regarding the asymmetry of political motivations.
What is that? Psychologists describe this phenomenon as assuming that your beliefs are based on love, while the other person's beliefs are founded on hate.
This is quite common in global disputes.
For example, between the Palestinians and Israelis.
The author of this article discovers that in today's United States, a significant portion of both Republicans and Democrats have divergent political motivations.
Today, most of the politically active individuals in our country believe they are driven by love, while the others are driven by hate.
Just think about it.
Most people always say, "My foundation of thought is love; I want to help people, while the other group is evil, and they are trying to bring me down."
A society with such divisions cannot progress.
This is impossible.
How do we solve this problem?
First, let's be honest: the divisions do exist.
We cannot reduce the divisions, because that would be a childish act.
There is a considerable amount of in-depth research on this.
My friend Jonathan Haidt is a regular at TED.
He is a psychology professor at New York University.
He studies the thoughts, values, and moral beliefs of different people, examining how they differ.
He demonstrated that conservatives and liberals have very different perspectives on what they consider important.
For example, Jonathan Haidt illustrated that liberals care about poverty 59% more than they care about economic freedom.
Conversely, conservatives care about economic freedom 28% more than they care about poverty.
The seemingly irreconcilable divisions, right?
We can't come together? No!
Our strength lies precisely in the divisions.
Remember what has stopped poverty:
It is an obsession and concern for the issue of poverty, along with the global free economic order.
We need each other; in other words, if we want to help people, we must aim to assist the additional 200 million people in escaping poverty.
There is no other way.
Well.
What should we do?
It's a very subtle matter, isn't it?
We need to innovate our thinking.
Many innovative ideas are right on this stage.
Yes! That extraordinary spirit of social entrepreneurship.
We need to invest overseas in a sustainable, responsible, and ethical manner.
But do you know what we really need?
We need to open up a new realm of flexible thinking,
We need a little less of the "foreseeable."
Right?
Have you ever felt that your thoughts are starting to become predictable?
Start to conform?
Do you feel that you always listen to the words of those who share your opinions?
Why is that dangerous?
Because when we talk about the economy in this country, on one side are the conservatives, who always discuss taxes, regulations, and big government control.
On the other side are the liberals, who always discuss income inequality when it comes to the economy.
Right? Those are indeed very important, important to me and important to you all.
But when those who are starving need our help, these are just distracting issues.
We should unite in the face of the best methods to do our utmost to reduce poverty, only when conservatives realize they need liberals' concerns about poverty, and liberals also need conservatives' obsession with the free market.
We will only succeed when we choose this path; this diversity will nurture the powerful strength of our future nation.
How can we achieve this goal? How can we accomplish it together?
I have some actionable suggestions, for you as well as for myself.
The first principle of the code of conduct: Remember, simply tolerating differing opinions is not enough.
Not nearly enough.
We must remember that we need those who disagree with us, for there is a group of people who need all of our help, and they are still waiting.
What are you prepared to do? How will you show it?
Where do we start? Right here!
All of us present here are fortunate.
We have those who listen to us,
We are successful; we possess leadership.
When people hear the thoughts of ideologies we are not familiar with, perhaps they will listen to us.
Perhaps this is the starting point of success.
This is the first point. Second.
The second point: I am asking you, and I am asking myself, to become specific individuals with blurred boundaries, to become ambiguous, hard-to-define people.
If you are a conservative, then be a conservative who frequently speaks about poverty issues, and a warrior who upholds the moral obligation to fight for the poor.
If you are a liberal, then be a liberal who frequently praises the allure of the free market when it operates responsibly.
If we do that, both goals will be within reach.
First, we begin our commitment to help the next two billion people solve their problems just as we have addressed so many issues in the past, and in the future, we will tackle even more. This is something we can achieve.
The second is that we may be able to overcome this terrible ideological war that causes us suffering, transforming it into a competition of ideas based on unity and mutual respect.
Perhaps by then, we may find that the so-called differences between us are not as irreconcilable as we thought.
Thank you!
