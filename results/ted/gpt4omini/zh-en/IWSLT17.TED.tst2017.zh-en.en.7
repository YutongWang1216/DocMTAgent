When I was young, I always dreamed of the ocean.
It is colorful and vibrant there, inhabited by many animals that resemble extraterrestrial beings.
I have imagined the great sharks at the top of the food chain, and I have also dreamed of sea turtles dancing gracefully among the coral reefs.
As a photographer who transitioned from a marine biologist, I have spent most of my career searching for those places that appeared in my childhood dreams.
As you can see, I have been adventuring in the water since I was very young.
But the first time I truly dove into the water was when I was 10 years old.
I can still clearly remember that at the time, I was paddling hard to reach a rusted cannon lying on the coral reef.
Finally, I successfully reached the cannon, and when I looked up, I found myself surrounded by schools of fish, in various colors, like a rainbow.
From that day on, I fell deeply in love with the ocean.

My subjects range from giant sharks to those small enough to swim in the palm of your hand.
In the cold waters off the coast of the Great Bear Rainforest in Canada, I encountered a humpback whale feasting right beside me, and the overwhelming smell of fish remains unforgettable.
In the Mozambique Channel, I witnessed the courtship ritual of green sea turtles.
Each of us will influence the ocean, and in turn, we will be influenced by it.
And the pristine ocean I dreamed of as a child is becoming increasingly difficult to find today.
Their range is increasingly shrinking, and the threats they face are growing.
Humans have always occupied the top position of the food chain on Earth, and I have witnessed and recorded these behaviors with my camera.
For a long time, I believed that only shocking photographs could awaken my audience.
Of course, this perspective has its advantages, as it brings me back to the starting point.
I believe the best way to bring about change is to spread love.
I see myself as a bridge between humans and animals; as a photographer, I have the rare opportunity to unveil the mysteries of the animals and ecosystems hidden deep within the ocean.
If you are unaware of the existence of something, how could you possibly love and protect it?
And this is precisely the strength of us environmental photographers.
I have visited hundreds of different oceanic regions, but there are only a few scenes that have truly left an indelible mark on my memory.
The first time I was struck by a scene like this was almost ten years ago, along the rugged and steep coastline of South Africa.
Every year, during June and July, countless sardines migrate north, a phenomenon we refer to as the "sardine run."
Believe me, these fish have to do this.
Because there are hungry, agile predators in packs chasing behind.
For example, the dolphins that hunt in groups will separate a portion of the sardines from the school and corral them into a ball.
The dolphins will drive these sardines closer to the surface and then rush into the school to feast, enjoying this moving banquet.
Right behind them are the sharks.
Most people would think that sharks and dolphins are natural enemies, but during the "sardine run," they coexist.
In fact, with the help of the dolphins, the sharks feast even more.
Without the dolphins' driving force, sardines find it difficult to form into a ball; sharks often swim right through the school, as if passing through a donut, sometimes only managing to gulp down a bellyful of water.
I have had several close encounters with schools of sharks during the "sardine run," and I understand that the sharks do not regard me as a threat.
But I still kept getting bumped into and swept by tails, just like the other guests at this noisy banquet.
We sailed east from the African coastline, crossing the vast Indian Ocean, and arrived in the Maldivesâ€”a group of islands formed by coral reefs.
During the stormy southwest monsoon season, the devil rays living in the waters of the archipelago gather near a small island called Hanifaru, located by the Baa Atoll.
Small groups of shrimp and crabs, most of which are smaller than our pupils, are the main food source for the devil rays.
When these plankton are relatively dispersed, the devil rays typically hunt alone, constantly rolling backward in the water, much like a puppy chasing its own tail.
As the plankton become increasingly abundant, the devil rays begin to line up in a long feeding formation, with the delicious morsels missed by the lead devil ray being swiftly consumed by their companions behind.
As the plankton in the bay become increasingly abundant, the formation of the devil rays also becomes more compact; this unique hunting method is what we call the "whirlwind feeding technique."
The devil rays overlap and rotate in a tight formation, creating a whirlpool that draws in the plankton and directs them straight into the devil rays' enormous mouths.
Diving among hundreds and thousands of devil rays was a sight that left an indelible mark on my memory.
When I first went to Hanifaru to take photographs, it had not yet been protected, and the ecological environment was threatened by local development.
By collaborating with non-governmental organizations like the "Devil Ray Trust," my photographs ultimately helped Hanifaru become a marine protected area.
Fishermen from nearby islands once hunted many devil rays, using their skins to make traditional drums.
And now, they have become the staunchest protectors of the devil rays, which bring in over $8 million annually to the Maldives.
I have always wanted to return to the past, to that time when most maps were still blank or marked with "Here be dragons."
So far, the most similar places I have visited are some remote atolls located in the western Indian Ocean.
Diving there, far from the fishing grounds and boats, always leaves me feeling melancholic, as it reminds me of what the ocean once was.
Few people have heard of Indian Atoll, a small coral atoll located in the Mozambique Channel.
The surrounding reefs form a protective barrier, and the central lagoon becomes a nursery for Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are never shy, even during the daytime.
I guess they become more active at night, and their numbers increase as well.
I had never seen so many sharks in a coral lagoon before.
Capturing and sharing such moments serves as a constant reminder of the original purpose behind my choice of this path.
Earlier this year, I traveled to the Baja California Peninsula to fulfill a contract shoot for National Geographic.
In the central part of the peninsula, on the side facing the Pacific Ocean, lies the San Ignacio Lagoon, an important breeding ground for gray whales.
Over the past century, this stretch of coastline has served as a massive slaughterhouse, with more than 20,000 gray whales killed here, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
And now, the descendants of these gray whales will push their calves to the surface, playing and frolicking, even interacting with us.
This species has surprisingly recovered.
On the other side of the peninsula is Punta Abreojos, a tranquil little fishing village.
Decades of overfishing once brought this village to the brink of bankruptcy.
In 1995, local fishermen persuaded the government to designate this area as a marine protected area.
What happened next can only be described as a miracle.
In 2005, just ten years after the protection efforts began, scientists discovered that the local fish populations had experienced a record recovery.
Seeing is believing; come along with me.
Take a deep breath and dive with me to the seabed to see what the largest and most densely packed schools of fish I have encountered look like.
We all have the ability to create hope.
I want to convey a message through my photographs: it is not too late to start saving the ocean.
I particularly want to focus on the restorative power of nature in the face of 7.3 billion people.
I hope that in the future, it will become increasingly difficult for me to capture such photographs, and instead, I will take more pictures that reflect the harmonious coexistence between humans and the ocean.
I really wish I could capture such photographs every day.
To make a name for yourself in our field, you must be an incorrigible optimist.
I always shoot with the assumption that the next great photograph that could bring about change is waiting for me just ahead, perhaps behind the next coral reef, in the next lagoon, or maybe in the one after that.
