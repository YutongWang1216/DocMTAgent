Alright, I’m going to tell a story about how we come to understand the things we know.
This story is about a woman named Natalia Lichinski.
She is a paleontologist, and her expertise lies in digging up ancient things everywhere.
Natalia Lichinski: "Yes, some people call me 'Doctor Dead Things.'"
I find her particularly interesting because the places where she digs are in the high-latitude Arctic Circle, in the remote permafrost regions of Canada.
One summer day in 2006, she was at an archaeological excavation site called the Falsye Bed, which is located less than 10 degrees latitude from the geomagnetic North Pole.
NR: "To be honest, it actually doesn't sound very interesting." "You have to carry a backpack all day, with a GPS navigator and a notebook," "constantly trekking long distances, picking up anything that might be a fossil."
However, at one moment, she noticed something.
"A small rust-colored object," she said, "about the size of my palm."
"It was just lying on the ground."
Her first reaction was that it was just a piece of wood, because this was something people had previously found at the Falsye Bed—prehistoric plant material.
But that night, back at the camp...
NR: "I took out the handheld microscope," "I observed it more closely, and suddenly I realized," "this thing seems to have no growth rings."
"It might be due to preservation issues," "but it really does seem like..."
"Bones."
So over the next four years, she repeatedly went to that location and eventually collected 30 fragments, all from the same piece of bone, many of which were very small.
"Actually, it's not that many. A small ziplock bag can hold it all."
Then she tried to piece the fragments together like a jigsaw puzzle.
But this is very challenging.
"It shattered into many tiny fragments," "We tried to restore it with sand and putty, but it looked terrible."
"Finally, we used a 3D surface scanner."
"Oh wow! 'Cool, right?'"
"Ultimately, it turned out that restoring it virtually was much simpler."
"When they were all pieced together, it felt truly magical."
How confident are you that you can piece it together correctly, to restore it to its original form?
Is it possible that you could piece it together in a different way, and end up with... something like a little parrot?
"Uh, no way. We're definitely piecing it together correctly."
She found that what she had pieced together was a tibia, or shinbone, and that this tibia came from a type of even-toed ungulate, such as cattle or sheep.
"But it definitely can't be cattle or sheep."
"It is simply too large."
"This thing is really too large. It belonged to a gigantic animal."
So what kind of animal could it be?
Now facing a bottleneck, she showed one of the fragments to some of her colleagues in Colorado, and they came up with an idea.
"We used a small saw and then scraped a little at the edges of the fragments," "and from there, some truly magical scents emerged."
It smelled a bit like burnt skin.
This is a scent that Natalia recognizes; she has smelled it before while cutting skulls in the gross anatomy lab, and that is collagen.
Collagen gives our bones their hardness.
Generally speaking, after so many years, it would naturally decompose.
However, the Arctic seems to act like a natural freezer, preserving it.
A year or two later, Natalia attended a conference in Bristol, where she saw one of her colleagues, named Mike Buckley, demonstrating a new technique he called "collagen fingerprinting."
In fact, collagen from different species has slight structural differences, so if you have collagen information from an unknown bone, you can compare it with collagen information from known species. Who knows, you might just find a matching profile.
So she sent a fragment to Mike via FedEx.
"Of course, you need to keep a close eye on the delivery progress. It's very important."
Then he processed the sample and compared it with 37 contemporary known species of mammals.
They found a match!
The final conclusion is that the bone, which is 3.5 million years old and was discovered by Natalia in the high-latitude Arctic Circle, comes from...
A camel.
"I was just thinking, what a joke is this?" "If we're not mistaken, this is truly amazing."
So they tested a large number of fragments and obtained the same results for each piece.
However, judging by the size of the bone they discovered, this camel was 30% larger than modern camels.
This camel was approximately 2.7 meters tall and weighed up to one ton.
(Exclaims) Yes!
Natalia discovered an "Arctic giant camel."
Now when you hear the word "camel," the image that comes to mind is that of the Bactrian camels found in East Asia and Central Asia.
But more likely, the image in your mind resembles this: a dromedary camel, a typical desert animal often found in hot desert regions such as the Middle East or the Sahara, with a large hump on its back that allows it to store water for long journeys across the desert, and wide, padded feet that help it traverse sand dunes.
So how did these guys end up in the high-latitude Arctic Circle?
In fact, scientists had long known, even before Natalia's discovery, that camels originally originated in the Americas.
(Music: The Star-Spangled Banner) They originated here.
During the 45 million years that camels existed, for 40 million of those years, you could only find them in North America, with a total of 20 different species, or perhaps even more.
"If we lined them up, would they look different?"
"Yes, there is a significant difference in their body sizes."
"Some of them have particularly long necks," "so they functionally resemble giraffes."
"Some of them also have long noses, resembling crocodiles."
"They are particularly primitive; some of the earliest ones may have been very small," "almost like a little rabbit."
"What? A camel the size of a rabbit?"
"Some of the earliest ones, yes."
"They are ones you might not even recognize."
"Oh my goodness, I really want a 'rabbit camel' as a pet!"
"I know, right? This is going to be amazing, isn't it?"
Then, around 3 to 7 million years ago, one branch of camels migrated south to South America, where they evolved into llamas or alpacas, while another branch crossed the Bering Land Bridge, reaching Asia and Africa.
By the end of the last Ice Age, the camels of North America became completely extinct.
So, scientists have long known this, but it doesn't fully explain how Natalia discovered camels in such a northern location.
From a temperature perspective, this place is simply the antonym of the Sahara.
To be honest, 3.5 million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius higher than it is today.
So it can be considered a northern forest, somewhat similar to today's Yukon River Basin or Siberia.
However, they still experience a six-month-long winter, during which all the ponds are frozen over.
You will encounter snowstorms.
You will encounter continuous darkness for 24 hours.
What exactly... what is going on?
How could these superstars of the Sahara Desert possibly survive in such frigid conditions?
Natalia and her colleagues felt they had found the answer.
And this answer is quite clever.
What if these characteristics of camels did not develop as we have thought, to adapt to environments like the Sahara, but rather evolved to endure harsh winters?
What if those broad feet were not designed for traversing sand dunes, but rather for walking across snowy plains like snowshoes?
What if those humps—this would be huge news!—are not storing moisture but fat, and the humps are actually designed to help camels endure the six-month-long winter of food scarcity?
What if, long after that, they transformed these winter characteristics after crossing the land bridge, adapting them to the hot desert environment?
For example, those humps might benefit camels in hot regions, because when your fat is accumulated in one area, you know, like a "fat backpack," it means that your body's insulation layer doesn't have to cover your entire body.
This makes heat dissipation easier.
It is this crazy idea that transforms the seemingly typical desert characteristics of camels into evidence of their origins in the high-latitude Arctic.
In fact, I am not the first person to tell this story.
Others have spoken of this, marveling at the wonders of biological evolution or offering a glimpse into future climate change scenarios.
But I absolutely love this story for another reason.
To me, this is a story about us, about how we perceive the world, and how that perception changes.
My profession is a historian.
I find that, in fact, many scientists are also historians.
They have figured out the past.
They tell the history of the universe, the Earth, and the organisms on Earth.
As a historian, you need to have a mindset in your mind, thinking about how this story will unfold.
"We weave stories, and then we follow that train of thought," she said, "just like the camels of the desert, right?"
"This is an amazing story! Camels are simply perfect for the desert."
"Clearly, camels have always lived there."
However, at any moment, you might discover some subtle clues.
You might discover some little things that force you to reshape everything you thought you knew.
Just like in this example, a scientist discovered this fragment, initially thinking it was wood; it is precisely because of this discovery that a completely new and counterintuitive theory emerged in the scientific community, explaining why this strange, yeti-like creature evolved into its current form.
For me, this completely overturned my view of camels.
It transformed from a creature existing solely for this specific environment into a global traveler, merely happening to appear in the Sahara Desert, yet it could show up anywhere at any time.
This is Azuli.
Hi, Azuli! How are you?
Here, I brought you some food.
Azuli has just finished her special performance and is coming over from Radio City Music Hall in New York.
This is no laughing matter.
Whatever... To be honest, Azuli is here as a living example that the stories of this world are ever-changing.
We need to take the initiative to boldly make changes and reimagine.
Azuli, don't you think so?
Truly, we are just a fragment of broken bone away from a whole new perspective on the world.
Thank you all.
