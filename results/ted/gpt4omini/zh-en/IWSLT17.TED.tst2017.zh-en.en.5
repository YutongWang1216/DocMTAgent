Food crisis.
Appeared in the daily news.
What is that?
In some parts of the world, food is too scarce, while in other areas, food production is abundant.
In some places, genetically modified food has saved the world.
Perhaps genetically modified food is a problem?
Excessive wastewater from genetically modified agriculture has created polluted oceans, toxic seawater, and nutrient-poor conditions.
This cycle continues.
I find that today's discussions are indeed lacking in impact.
How can we make such discussions understandable to everyone?
How about the food crisis regarding apples?
I am sure that each of you has eaten an apple in the past week.
How long do you think it takes for an apple to go from being picked to reaching your hands?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months — this is the average time it takes for apples sold in American markets to go from being picked to being sold.
I think it's probably similar in Europe and in various parts of the world.
We pick apples, store them in refrigeration, and introduce oxygen into the cold storage — in fact, there are documented records indicating that workers have attempted to enter such environments to retrieve an apple, only to perish because the air in the cold storage under such conditions is toxic to humans.
Why does no one among you know about this?
Why do I not know about this?
Ninety percent of the nutrients in apples — all of the antioxidants in apples — are completely lost by the time we purchase them.
It’s just a little candy.
Why do we not know about this information? How can we improve this situation?
I believe we lack a platform.
I know the platform—I use a computer; I was active online when I was very young.
I have done many very strange things—on such a platform.
But I also encountered others with whom I could express my thoughts.
What is your perspective on food?
If we had a platform, we might find that this issue is very beneficial—"What if?"
I would like to ask: What if the climate is democratic?
This is a global climate distribution map.
The most efficient agricultural production areas are marked in green, while the least efficient are marked in red.
They will constantly shift and change; California farmers have now become Mexican farmers.
China has acquired land in Brazil in hopes of growing better food; we are all slaves to the environment.
What if each country has its own climate suitable for production?
How would that change our lives?
How would that change the quality of our lives and nutrition?
The previous generation faced the issue of needing more food at lower prices.
Welcome to the World Farm.
We have built a massive simulation farm.
These trajectories of lines—are from cars, planes, trains, and automobiles.
It is a miracle to be able to provide enough food for 7 billion people, especially when very few people are involved in the food production process.
But what if...
Shall we build a digital farm?
Digital World Farm.
What if you could take this apple, to some extent digitize it, transmit it through particles in the air, and then reassemble the particles on the other side?
What if?
Looking at these quoted words, you know, they encouraged me to do this.
The first point: "Japanese agriculture has no young people, no water, no land, and no future." This was on the day I arrived in Minamisanriku, which is one stop south of Fukushima, after the nuclear power plant accident.
The children have all gone to Sendai and Tokyo, the land has been contaminated by the nuclear power plant accident, and their food import rate has reached 70%.
But this is not a phenomenon unique to Japan.
Only 2% of the American population is engaged in agriculture-related work.
What answers do the 2% of the population engaged in agriculture provide us?
Let's look at other parts of the world, where 50% of Africa's population is under the age of 18.
Eighty percent of them are unwilling to become farmers.
Agriculture is too difficult.
The life of small farmers is too difficult.
They choose to go to the city.
In India: Farmers' families cannot access the most basic agricultural tools, and the number of farmers committing suicide exceeds that of the past ten years.
It is too heartbreaking to speak of these things.
Where are they going?
To the city.
There are no young people; the young have all gone to the city.
What kind of platform should we build to encourage young people?
Please take a look at this new tractor.
This is my combine harvester.
Several years ago, I went to a home goods store to start looking for tools.
I have made stupid things; I made plants dance, connected them to my computer, and then I destroyed them—many of them.
I ultimately let them survive.
I created one of the closest relationships in my life because I learned the language of plants the most.
I want them to grow bigger.
They said, "Child, give it your all!"
This unused electronic workshop.
What can you do?
Together with the team members, we built a farm in the media lab, a place that was once considered related to electronic life rather than biology.
In this 60-square-meter space, we produced enough staple food to supply about 300 people for one month—not too much.
There are many interesting technologies here.
The most interesting thing is?
Beautiful white rhizomes, deep green plants, harvested once a month.
Is this a new-style restaurant?
Is this a new-style sales experience?
Is this a new-style shop?
What I can be sure of is: this is the first time that any plant can be uprooted in the media lab.
We put the salad in bags; there's nothing wrong with that.
But what happens when you have an image processing expert, a data scientist, and a robotics specialist uprooting plants and thinking, "Hmm, I know about this—I can make the plan work, I want to give it a try."
Throughout the process, we take the plants outside and also bring some back to the lab, because if you have personally grown them, you wouldn't discard them; they are precious to you.
I now have this strange tongue, because I don't want anyone to eat them before me; I hope they taste good.
I eat lettuce every day, and I know that the pH value of lettuce is less than 1.
I now say, "No, that's 6.1—no, you can't eat it today."
(Applause) This lettuce was very sweet that day.
That is because the lettuce feels a lot of pressure; it produces chemical reactions to protect itself: "I don't want to die!"
The flavor of plants that don't want to die tastes sweet.
Scientists are returning to research on plant physiology.
I think everyone can try to get involved.
We look forward to seeing everyone's creations, so we envisioned a laboratory that could be transported to other locations.
To bring such an idea to fruition.
The front of this media experiment building is my laboratory, where each plant has 30 sensing points.
If you understand genomics or genetics, this is the phenome, right?
The phenomena presented by the phenome.
When you say, "I like strawberries from Mexico," what you really like are the strawberries produced under such climatic conditions.
You can encode such climatic conditions—how much carbon dioxide, how much oxygen—to create recipes; you can program the plants' presentation, nutritional content, size, shape, color, and texture.
We need data, so we installed many sensors to provide us with information.
You might recall the plants at home, looking at them sadly, wondering, "Why did you die? Would you talk to me?"
Farmers have the most beautiful eyes that can foresee the future, especially when they are in their sixties or seventies.
They can tell you that the plant died because of a lack of nitrogen in the soil, a deficiency of calcium, or that it needs a more humid air environment.
These beautiful eyes will not be passed down.
These are the eyes of farmers.
We will continue to collect data and information.
We combine these data points with individual plants.
These are the IP address data for all the cauliflower in my laboratory that day.
We have cauliflower with traceable IP addresses.
(Applause) If that's not strange enough, you can click here to see the plant's profile.
This shows you the downloadable growth process of the plant, not as you might imagine, but not just notifying you when it's edible.
When do its nutrients meet my needs?
When does its flavor meet my expectations?
Is it too much moisture?
Is it exposed to the sun for too long?
It will all be prompted.
It can converse with me, communicate, and we can engage in a verbal dialogue.
(Applause) I suppose that's the first user of Plant Facebook, right?
At that time, the plant's profile will start making friends.
I'm serious—plants will start making friends with those that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, and less potassium.
We will begin to understand those complex matters that can currently only be speculated upon.
They may not be friendly with us—I don't know, perhaps they will get along with us, depending on our behavior.
This is my current laboratory.
This is a bit more systematic; my background is in designing data centers for hospitals, and I know how to create a controlled environment.
So—in this environment, we experiment with all kinds of things.
This program, known as aeroponics, was developed by NASA for the Mir Space Station to reduce the amount of water resources they need to transport to space.
This program accurately provides plants with what they want: water, minerals, and oxygen.
The roots are not that complicated; when you provide these to them, you can see astonishing results.
Plants have two hearts.
It is precisely because they have two hearts that they exhibit growth rates 4 to 5 times faster.
This is a perfect world.
We have undergone a long technological development in search of a different world. We will continue to do so, but we will also have new tools, and this will be a perfect world.
We grow a variety of things.
These tomatoes have not been commercially produced in the past 150 years.
Do you know that we have a rare, ancient seed bank?
Seed bank.
This is amazing.
They have living germplasm of foods you have never tasted.
I am the only person in this room who has eaten this type of tomato.
The problem is that these are sauce tomatoes, and we don't know how to cook with them, which is why they seem unappetizing.
But we have grown a variety of protein-rich foods.
We have grown humans—maybe you can, but we cannot.
We realize that the tools are too large and too expensive.
I began to place them around the world, valued at approximately $100,000.
It's not easy to find someone who can freely dispose of $100,000, so we want to create smaller tools.
This is actually a project by one of my students—a mechanical engineering undergraduate, Camille.
Camille and I, along with my team, spent the entire summer conducting repeated experiments on how to make it cheaper, how to make it work better, and how to enable others to learn how to operate it.
Then we send these tools to schools for children in grades 7 to 11.
If you want to become humble, try teaching children how to do something.
I went to the school and said, "Set its humidity to 65%."
A seventh grader asked, "What humidity?"
So I said, "Oh, it's the moisture in the air."
He said, "There's no water in the air at all, you idiot."
So I said, "Alright, don't believe me."
In fact—don't believe me, right?
Set it to 100.
He set the humidity to 100, and what happened?
It began to condense, producing mist, and eventually started to drip.
Then he said, "Oh, humidity is rain."
"Why didn't you say it to me like this before?"
The interface we created looks like a game.
They have a 3D environment that can be accessed globally from mobile phones and computers.
The program includes different components—physical adjustments and sensors.
They selected recipes created by children in other parts of the world.
They select and activate the recipes, planting the seeds.
As the seeds grow, the children can make changes.
They asked, "Why do plants need carbon dioxide? Isn't carbon dioxide a bad thing?"
"It can be suffocating."
Increasing the supply of carbon dioxide, the plants died.
Reducing the amount of carbon dioxide, the plants thrived.
Harvesting plants, you have created a new electronic recipe.
This is a repetitive process of design, development, and exploration.
They can download all the data on the new plants they developed, or the new electronic recipes detailing what they did—whether it was better or worse?
Imagine these as individual core elements of processing.
We can learn a lot of things.
This is what we call a food computer, which has been placed in a school for three weeks.
This is three weeks of planting.
More importantly, this is the first time this child believes he can be a farmer—or rather, he wants to become a farmer.
So we are making these resources publicly available.
Everything is available online; go home and try to build your first food computer.
This will be difficult—I’m telling you this.
We are in the initial stages, but the resources are all there.
For me, making these easily accessible is very important.
We will continue to do so.
These are farmers, electronic engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, botanists, economists, and urban planners.
On a platform, doing what they each excel at.
The team has become too large.
This is my new experimental equipment, which is now starting to operate.
This warehouse can be built anywhere.
This is why I chose it.
In this warehouse, we will build such a shelf.
You can see it now.
Take a look at this.
This also exists.
One grows green vegetables, and the other grows an Ebola virus vaccine.
What's great is that the plants and this American Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) award-winning project are the effective reasons for our research on the Ebola virus.
These plants are producing proteins that combat the Ebola virus.
So from pharmaceuticals and health products to lettuce cultivation.
But these two things seem completely different, which is part of my own field.
But many things are not as they seem.
We are still in the "We are right" stage, like, "This is my little black box—" "No, buy mine."
"No, no, no—my intellectual property is absolutely valuable."
"Don't buy this, buy mine."
In fact, we are only in the initial stage, and society is also undergoing changes at this time.
As we seek more and cheaper food, we now need higher quality, environmentally friendly food.
But when you see McDonald's advertisements promoting the ingredients of McNuggets, the most mysterious food in human history—McDonald's marketing strategy is changing—all things are changing.
Now let's take a look at today's world.
Personal food computers, food servers, and food data centers operate in an open phenome database.
Just like an open genome, we need to compile small climate recipes, similar to Wikipedia, where you can overturn, activate, and cultivate.
How does this look?
Do you remember that the world is connected by fine threads?
Bacon is starting to appear.
We begin to send information about food, rather than distributing food.
This is not just my fantasy; it is the work we are already undertaking.
Food computers, food servers, and soon food data centers connect people to share information.
The future of food is not its erroneous struggle.
We all know where the mistake lies.
The future of food is about connecting the next billion farmers and empowering them through a platform of questions and answers, "What if?"
Thank you.
