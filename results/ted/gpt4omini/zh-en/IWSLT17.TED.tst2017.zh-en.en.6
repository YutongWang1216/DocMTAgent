Sometimes, as a European, I feel very ashamed.
Last year, over a million people arrived in Europe needing our help, and our response, to be frank, has been quite dismal.
There are too many contradictions here.
We mourn the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi; however, since then, over two hundred children have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea.
We have international conventions that recognize the reception of refugees as a shared responsibility among nations; however, we find that the small country of Lebanon has taken in more Syrians than the entire continent of Europe.
We condemn the existence of human trafficking; however, we have made it the only viable route for seeking asylum in Europe.
We have a labor shortage; however, we are preventing those who could meet our economic and demographic needs from entering Europe.
We claim that our liberal values are in stark contrast to those upheld by Islamic fundamentalists; however, we implement repressive policies that detain child asylum seekers, separate children from their families, and forcibly confiscate the property of refugees.
What are we doing?
How did the situation develop to this extent? We are responding to a humanitarian crisis in an inhumane manner.
I don't believe it's because people don't care; at least, I refuse to believe that.
I believe this is due to our politicians' lack of foresight and their inability to adapt to the challenges posed by a constantly changing and globalized world that was identified fifty years ago.
The international refugee system, so what I want to do is take a step back and pose two very fundamental questionsâ€”questions that we all must understand.
First, why does the existing system not work?
Secondly, how do we solve this?
The modern refugee system was established after World War II, created by these individuals.
Its original intention was to ensure that when a country collapses, or worse, when the regime is hostile to its people, these individuals have a place to seek refuge where they can live safely and with dignity until they can return to their homeland.
This is exactly what we see in Syria today.
Through the international conference signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and the commitment of the international organization UNHCR to allow individuals from other countries to enter their territories in order to escape war, conflict, and persecution among member states.
But now, this system is collapsing.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In reality, our immigration policies obstruct this path to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to equal treatment or the right to choose to return to their homeland.
But in practice, they are trapped in a state of nearly indefinite stagnation.
In theory, the refugee issue is a responsibility shared by all nations.
In reality, geographic proximity means that neighboring countries are overloaded with the vast majority of refugees.
The existing regulations of the refugee system are not the reason for its collapse.
But rather, we have not sufficiently adapted to the changes in the world, which is something we need to reconsider.
Therefore, I hope to explain to you how the current system works.
How does the current refugee reception system operate?
But this is not from a top-down macro perspective, but rather from the perspective of individual refugees.
So, imagine a Syrian woman.
Let's call her Amira.
Amira represents the many refugees I encountered in the region.
Amira, like about a quarter of the world's refugees, is a woman with a child. She cannot return home because her city, the once beautiful and historically rich city of Homs that you see now, is in ruins.
Therefore, Amira cannot go back.
Amira also has no hope of resettling in a third country, as that is akin to winning the lottery; less than one percent of the world's refugees are likely to achieve it.
So Amira and her family are faced with an almost impossible choice.
They have three basic options.
The first option is for Amira to take her family to a refugee camp.
In the refugee camp, she may receive help, but the outlook for Amira and her family is very bleak.
The camp is located in a desolate and barren area, typically in the desert.
In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, you can hear the sound of artillery crossing the Syrian border at night.
Economic activities there are restricted.
The quality of education is usually very low.
Moreover, approximately eighty percent of refugees in camps around the world are forced to remain there for at least five years.
This is a tragic situation, which may also explain why, in reality, only nine percent of Syrians have chosen this option.
Or Amira could go to a city in a neighboring country, such as Amman or Beirut.
Seventy-five percent of Syrian refugees have chosen this option.
But even there, it is fraught with difficulties.
Refugees in the city usually do not have the right to work.
They usually do not have access to assistance.
So when Amira and her family have exhausted their basic savings, they are left with very little and are likely facing poverty.
There is a third option that is being chosen by an increasing number of Syrians.
Amira can seek hope for her family by embarking on a perilous journey that could cost them their lives to another country; this is the situation we see in Europe today.
Globally, we leave refugees with an almost impossible choice among these three options: refugee camps, urban poverty, and perilous journeys.
For refugees, this choice embodies the current global refugee system.
But I believe this is a wrong choice.
I believe we can reconsider this choice.
The reason we restrict these options is that we believe they are the only choices available to refugees, but in reality, they are not.
Politicians frame it as a zero-sum game: if refugees benefit, then citizens must bear the loss.
We seem to agree on the assumption that refugees are an inevitable burden and cost to society.
But this is not a given; refugees can make contributions.
What I want to demonstrate is that we can expand that option while still benefiting everyone: including the host countries and communities, our society, and the refugees themselves.
I would like to propose four ways to transform our established perceptions of refugees.
These four approaches share a commonality: we all leverage globalization, social mobility, and market opportunities to update our understanding of the refugee issue.
What I would like to consider first is the concept of creating an environment, which stems from a fundamental understanding that refugees, like everyone else, are simply individuals situated in a specific context.
My colleagues at the University of Oxford and I have initiated a research project in Uganda to study the economic lives of refugees.
We chose Uganda not because it is a typical representative among host countries.
It is precisely an exception.
Unlike most host countries in the world, what Uganda does is provide economic opportunities for refugees.
Grant them the right to work and the freedom to move.
The result of this is astonishing, both for the refugees and the host countries.
In the capital of Uganda, Kampala, we found that twenty-one percent of refugees start their own businesses and employ others, with forty percent of the employees being nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees are creating jobs for the citizens of the host country.
Even in refugee camps, we found examples of vibrant and thriving entrepreneurial ventures.
For example, in a refugee camp known as Nakivale, we found Congolese refugees running a business trading digital music.
We found a business run by Rwandan refugees that allows young people to play computer games on recycled consoles and screens.
Breaking through extreme constraints, the refugees are continuously innovating. Before you is a Congolese man named Damon-Kay.
When he arrived at the refugee camp, he had nothing to his name, but he aspired to become a filmmaker.
So, together with friends and colleagues, he established a community radio station. He rented a camera, and he is now making films.
He has already filmed two documentaries for our team and also on behalf of our team, and he started with very few resources to build a successful career.
It is precisely such examples that should guide our response to refugees.
Rather than viewing refugees as inevitably dependent on humanitarian aid, we need to provide them with opportunities to achieve human flourishing.
Indeed, clothing, blankets, shelter, and food are all very important in the emergency phase, but we must also have long-term considerations.
We need to provide internet connectivity, electricity, the right to education and work, as well as funding and business opportunities.
All the pathways to access the global economy that we take for granted can and should be made available to refugees.
The second idea I want to discuss is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world have adopted Uganda's policies.
Most host countries' economies are not open to refugees, but we still have viable alternative options.
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, development economist Paul Correa, where we discussed an idea aimed at providing employment for Syrians while also advancing Jordan's national development strategy in collaboration with the international community and local governments.
The idea is to establish an economic zone where we can integrate refugee employment with the national employment of the host country, Jordan.
Just a 15-minute drive from the Zaatari refugee camp, this area, housing 83,000 refugees, is an existing economic zone known as the King Hussein Development Zone.
The government has invested over one hundred million dollars to connect the power grid and roads, but two things are still lacking: labor and foreign investment.
So, what if refugees could work there instead of being trapped in refugee camps, able to support their families before returning to Syria and develop skills through vocational training?
We recognize that doing so benefits Jordan, as its national development strategy requires an upgrade of its manufacturing sector as a middle-income country.
This approach benefits refugees while also aiding in the post-war reconstruction of Syria by recognizing that we need to cultivate refugees as the best resource for the eventual rebuilding of Syria.
We published this perspective in the journal Foreign Affairs.
King Abdullah of Jordan has also adopted this idea.
Two weeks ago, it was announced at the Syria conference in London that the pilot project will be implemented this summer.
The third idea I want to present is the preference matching between the state and refugees. To achieve this satisfactory outcome depicted in the selfie, the photo shows German Chancellor Angela Merkel alongside a Syrian refugee.
We rarely ask refugees what they want or where they wish to go, but I argue that we can do so while benefiting everyone involved.
The economist Alvin Roth created the concept of matching markets, where the preferences of both parties determine the final match.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alexis Tate-Bowen are researching how to apply this concept to address the refugee issue. They ask refugees to rank their preferred countries while also allowing countries to rank the types of refugees they wish to accept based on criteria such as skills or language. Ultimately, the two rankings are matched.
Of course, you need to establish quotas in terms of diversity and vulnerability, but this is a method that can enhance the likelihood of successful matching.
This matching concept has been successfully applied, for example, to match students with universities and kidney donors with patients. It also highlights the importance of algorithms in dating websites.
So why not apply it to give refugees better options?
This can also be applied at the national level, where the biggest challenge we face is persuading local communities to accept refugees.
Currently, using my country as an example, we often send engineers to remote areas and farmers to the cities, which makes no sense at all.
Therefore, matching the market provides a potential way to align these preferences and reflects the needs and demands of both the host country's citizens and the refugees.
My fourth idea is humanitarian visas.
The tragedies and chaos we see in Europe are entirely preventable.
This stems from a fundamental contradiction in Europe's asylum policies: in order to seek asylum in Europe, you must first arrive there on your own, undergoing the perilous journey I described earlier. But why are these journeys necessary?
In an era where there are budget airlines and consulates?
These journeys are entirely unnecessary; last year, this led to the deaths of over three thousand people at the European borders and within Europe.
If refugees could directly travel to Europe and seek asylum, we could avoid these deaths. This is indeed achievable through humanitarian visas, which allow individuals to obtain visas at embassies or consulates in neighboring countries, and then cover their own expenses to reach Europe by cruise or plane.
It costs about one thousand euros to smuggle a migrant from Turkey to the Greek islands.
It only costs two hundred euros to fly from Bodrum, Turkey, to Frankfurt, Germany, on a budget airline.
If we allow them to do so, it would yield tremendous results.
This would save lives, eliminate the market for illegal smuggling, and alleviate the chaos we see at the edges of Europe, such as in the Greek islands.
The reason preventing us from implementing this solution is political, rather than a rational one.
And this is an idea that has already been applied.
Brazil was the first to adopt this policy, granting humanitarian visas to over 2,000 Syrians who entered Brazil and applied for refugee status upon arrival.
In that program, every Syrian was granted refugee status and confirmed to be a genuine refugee.
There is also a historical precedent.
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports served as travel documents, allowing 450,000 Assyrians, Turks, and Chechens to traverse Europe and apply for refugee status in other parts of Europe.
The Nansen International Refugee Office was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this viable solution.
So, the four ideas I presented to you are ways we can expand Amira's options.
Allowing refugees to have better choices, rather than being limited to the three basic, impossible options I mentioned earlier, would still benefit everyone.
Overall, we need a fresh perspective to expand refugees' choices while recognizing that they are not necessarily a burden on society.
Refugees becoming a cost is not a foregone conclusion.
Indeed, refugees are our humanitarian responsibility, but they are also individuals with skills, talents, and aspirationsâ€”capable of contributing to societyâ€”if we allow them to do so.
In a new world, migration will not disappear.
The scenes we see in Europe will persist for many years to come.
People will continue to migrate, and they will still leave their homes. We need to find a rational and realistic way to manage thisâ€”not based on the old logic of humanitarian aid, nor on the logic of charity, but on the opportunities brought about by globalization, markets, and mobility.
I hope everyone recognizes this, and I urge our government officials to embrace this challenge.
Thank you, everyone.
