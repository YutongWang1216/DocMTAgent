Hello.
My name is Matthew Williams, and I am a champion.
I have won medals in three different sports and national championships in Canada, played at an international level in basketball, and I was proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I train 5 days a week in basketball and speed skating, work with high-quality coaches and mental performance consultants to be the best in my sport.
Furthermore, I do all of this with the Special Olympics.
Does this change the way you perceive me and my accomplishments?
The world does not see people like me as champions.
Not so long ago, people like me were shunned and hidden.
The Special Olympics have evolved a lot since the beginning in 1968, but too often, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the general public.
People use the word "R" with me, and they think it's not a big deal.
It's the word "retarded" or "backward" used in a derogatory way.
They do not realize how much it hurts us, me and my friends.
I don't want you to think that I am here for charity work.
I am here because there is still a big problem with the way many people perceive individuals with intellectual disabilities, or, too often, the way they do not see them at all.
Did you know that the world championships took place this year?
I was among the over 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries who came to Los Angeles to compete.
There were over 62,000 spectators at the opening ceremonies, and TSN and ESPN were there to cover the event.
Did you know that this event had taken place?
What do you think when you meet someone like me?
I am here today to challenge you to consider us as equals.
The Special Olympics transform the unique identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perception of anyone watching the competition.
For those of you who do not know, the Special Olympics are aimed at athletes with intellectual disabilities.
The Special Olympics are separate from the Paralympic and Olympic Games.
We offer high-quality sports programs all year round for individuals with intellectual disabilities, which changes lives and perceptions.
This movement has changed my life and that of so many others.
And this has changed the way the world sees people with intellectual disabilities.
I was born epileptic and with an intellectual disability.
Growing up, I played hockey until I was 12 years old.
The more I grew up, the more I felt that it was harder to keep up with others, and I was annoyed and frustrated.
For a while, I didn't practice any sports anymore, had no friends, and felt forgotten and sad.
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden from society.
No one thought they could practice a sport, let alone be an important member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, studied the effects of regular exercise on the physical condition of children with intellectual disabilities.
Using rigorous scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers concluded that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that led to physical fitness issues.
Many people doubted that individuals with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sports competitions.
But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of the Special Olympics, persevered, and the athletes of the Special Olympics proved them right four and a half million times.
Before I joined the Special Olympics, I was nervous because I was young, shy, and had little confidence in myself, and I didn't have many friends.
When I arrived, however, everyone encouraged me a lot, supported me, and let me be myself without being judged.
Now, I am a basketball player and a speed skater who has competed in regional and national games, and this year, finished at the Summer World Games in Los Angeles, where I was part of the very first Canadian basketball team to participate in the World Games.
I am one of over four and a half million athletes from around the world, and I have heard so many similar stories.
Being an athlete in the Special Olympics restores pride and dignity.
The Special Olympics also address important health needs.
Studies have shown that on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than men without, and women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years younger than women without.
The Special Olympics keep us healthy by keeping us active and engaging us in sports.
Furthermore, our coaches teach us about nutrition and health.
The Special Olympics also provide free screening tests for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor or accessing medical care.
At the 2015 World Summer Games, my teammates from Team Canada and I were playing against the team from Nigeria.
The day before our game, the Nigerian basketball team came for screening at the World Games Athletes were distributed free to seven out of ten members and had the opportunity to hear clearly for the first time.
This change for them was incredible.
They were very excited, happy, and confident, as their coaches could communicate orally with them.
And they were very moved because they could hear the sounds of the basketball, the sounds of the whistle, and the enthusiastic fans in the stands - sounds that we take for granted.
The Special Olympics do more than just transform athletes in sports.
The Special Olympics transform their lives off the field.
This year, a study has shown that nearly half of adults in the United States do not know a single person with an intellectual disability, and the 44% of Americans who do not have personal contact with intellectual disabilities are significantly less tolerant and positive.
Then there is the word "R", demonstrating that individuals with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people.
People use it as a common term or an insult.
It has been tweeted over nine million times last year, and it is deeply hurtful for me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the world.
People don't realize that it's insulting, but it is.
As my fellow athlete and global spokesperson John Franklin Stephens wrote in an open letter to a political commentator who had used the "R" word as an insult, "Come join us one day at the Special Olympics.
You will see if you leave with an unchanged heart.
This year, at the 2015 World Summer Games, people lined up for hours before diving into the final night of weightlifting competition.
The venue was packed that evening when my teammate Jackie Barrett, the Newfoundland Elk, lifted 297 kg and 277 kg in squats - setting huge new records at the Special Olympics.
Jackie is one of the record holders among all weightlifters from Newfoundland - not just at the Special Olympics but all weightlifters.
Jackie was a huge celebrity in Los Angeles, and ESPN tweeted live about his new record and was impressed by his performance.
Fifty years ago, few people imagined mentally disabled individuals capable of doing something like this.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of the World Games and applaud athletes from 165 countries from around the world.
Far from being hidden, we were applauded and celebrated.
The Special Olympics teach athletes to be confident and proud of themselves.
The Special Olympics teach the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and consideration.
Now, I have dreams and successes in my sport, great coaches, respect and dignity, better health, and I am pursuing a career as a personal trainer.
I am no longer hidden, mocked, and I am here giving a TED talk.
The world is a different place thanks to the Special Olympics, but there is still work to be done.
So the next time you see someone with intellectual disabilities, I hope you see their talent.
Next time someone uses the "R" word next to you, I hope you will tell them how hurtful it is.
I hope that you will consider getting involved in the Special Olympics.
I would like to leave you with one final thought.
Nelson Mandela used to say, "Sport has the power to change the world."
The Special Olympics change the world by transforming four and a half million athletes and giving us a place to have confidence, meet friends, not be judged, and feel and be champions.
Thank you very much.
