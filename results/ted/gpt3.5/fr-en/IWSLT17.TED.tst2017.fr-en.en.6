Sometimes, I feel ashamed to be European.
Last year, over a million people in need of our help arrived in Europe and our response was frankly pathetic.
There are so many contradictions.
We mourn the tragic death of Alan Kurdi, a two-year-old child, and yet, since then, over 200 children have drowned in the Mediterranean.
International treaties recognize that refugees are a collective responsibility, and yet we accept that tiny Lebanon hosts more Syrians than the whole of Europe combined.
We lament the existence of smugglers, yet we make it the only viable route to seek asylum in Europe.
We lack labor force, yet we prevent people who meet our economic and demographic needs from coming to Europe.
We proclaim our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist Islam, yet we have repressive policies that detain minor asylum seekers, separate children from their families, and seize refugees' assets.
What are we doing?
How did we get to the point where we adopted such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis?
I don't believe it's due to a lack of interest, at least I don't want to believe it.
I believe it's because our politicians lack vision, they don't know how to adapt the international asylum rules, created over 50 years ago, to globalization.
I want to step back and ask two fundamental questions, the two questions that we all must ask.
First, why is the current system not working?
Secondly, how can we remedy this?
The current regime for refugees was created following the consequences of the Second World War by these individuals.
Its primary goal is to ensure that when a state fails, or worse, turns against its people, individuals have a place to go, to live safely and with dignity until they can return.
It was created precisely for situations such as the current situation in Syria.
Through an international convention signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and an international organization, the UNHCR, states have committed to mutually admit individuals fleeing conflict and persecution onto their territory.
But today, this system is failing.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In practice, our immigration policies block the path to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to integration or to return to their country of origin.
But in practice, they remain stuck in eternal limbo.
In theory, refugees are a global collective responsibility.
In practice, geography means that countries close to the conflict host the vast majority of refugees.
The system is not broken because the rules are bad
but because we do not apply them adequately to a changing world, and that is what we must reconsider.
I will explain to you how the current system works.
How does the current system for refugees work?
But not from an institutional perspective, rather from the point of view of a refugee.
Imagine a Syrian woman. Let's call her Amira.
For me, Amira represents
many people I have met in the region.
Amira, like 25% of refugees in the world, is a woman with children, and she cannot return home because she comes from that city you see: Homs. A city that was beautiful and historic and is now in ruins.
Amira cannot go back there.
But Amira has no hope of settling in a third country, because there is a lottery available to only less than 1% of refugees.
Amira and her family are facing an impossible choice.
They have three options.
The first option is for Amira to take her family to a camp.
In the camp, she could be helped, but there is little future for Amira and her family.
The camps are in harsh and arid locations, often in the desert.
At the Zaatari camp in Jordan, at night, you can hear the bombings on the other side of the border.
Economic activity is limited.
Education is often of poor quality.
Around 80% of refugees worldwide who are in camps have to stay there for at least 5 years.
It is a miserable life, and that is probably why, in reality, only 9% of Syrians choose this option.
One alternative for Amira is to head to the urban area of a neighboring country, such as Amman or Beirut.
This is an option chosen by about 75% of Syrian refugees.
But it also comes with difficulties.
Refugees in such urban areas often do not have the right to work.
They often do not have access to help.
And so when Amira and her family have spent all their savings, they will have nothing left and will be in urban poverty.
There is a third possibility that an increasing number of Syrians choose.
Amira can seek hope for her family by risking their lives in a dangerous and perilous journey to another country, and this is what we are seeing today in Europe.
Therefore, we offer refugees an almost impossible choice between three options: staying in a camp, urban poverty, or a dangerous journey.
For refugees, this choice is today's refugee regime.
But I believe that it is a false choice.
We can reconsider this choice.
The reason we limit these options is because we believe they are the only possible options for refugees, but that is not the case.
Policymakers see this as a zero-sum game, if we favor refugees, citizens pay the price.
We tend to think that refugees are an inevitable cost or burden on society.
But they don't have to be. They can contribute.
What I mean is that there are ways to increase opportunities and that everyone benefits: the host countries and communities, our societies, and the refugees.
And I want to suggest four ways to transform our vision of refugees.
These four perspectives have one thing in common: they include opportunities of globalization, mobility, and markets, and modernize our way of thinking about the refugee issue.
The first idea is that of supportive environments. It starts with the fundamental recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but with extraordinary circumstances.
With my colleagues from Oxford, we embarked on a research project in Uganda, observing the economic life of refugees.
We chose Uganda, not because it is representative of all host countries.
It is exceptional.
Contrary to the majority of host countries, Uganda has provided an economic opportunity for refugees.
It gives them the right to work, the freedom to move.
And the results are extraordinary, for the refugees and for the host community.
In the capital, Kampala, we discovered that 21% of refugees own a business employing people, and 40% of these employees are natives of the host country.
In other words, refugees create jobs for citizens of the host country.
Even in the camps, we discovered extraordinary examples of dynamic and thriving businesses.
For example, in a village called Nakivale, we have the example of Congolese refugees running digital music sharing businesses.
We found a Rwandan who runs a company to allow young people to play video games on recycled consoles and televisions.
Despite the challenges of extreme constraints, refugees innovate, and the man you see is a Congolese named Demou-Kay.
Demou-Kay arrived at the camp with very few belongings, but he wanted to become a director.
So, with friends and colleagues, he launched a community radio station, rented a camera, and makes films.
He has made two documentaries with and for our team and is in the process of creating a successful business with almost nothing.
It is these kinds of examples that should guide our response towards refugees.
Rather than seeing refugees as inevitably dependent on humanitarian aid, we must provide them with the opportunity for human development.
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food are very important in the emergency phase, but we must go further.
We must offer the opportunity for connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, and access to banks.
Everything we consider as granted, which integrates us into the global economy, can and should be offered to refugees.
The second idea I want to talk about is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world have the approach that Uganda has.
Most host countries do not open their economy to refugees in this way.
But there are always pragmatic options that we can use.
Last April, I went to Jordan with my colleague, the development economist Paul Collier, and we reflected on an idea that we had there with the international community and the government, an idea to create jobs for Syrians while supporting Jordan's national development strategy.
It's the idea of an economic zone where we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees as well as the employment of natives of the host country.
15 minutes away from the Zaatari camp, which hosts 83,000 refugees, is the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Zone.
The government spent over 100 million dollars to connect it to the electrical and road networks, but two things were missing: access to labor and foreign investments.
so that refugees can work there instead of being stuck in camps, support their families, develop skills through vocational training before returning to Syria.
We acknowledged that Jordan would benefit from it, as its development strategy requires transitioning from a middle-income country to an industrial one.
Refugees would benefit from it, but it would also contribute to the reconstruction of Syria after the war, recognizing that we must incubate refugees as they are the best resource to rebuild Syria.
We published this idea in the Foreign Affairs journal.
King Abdullah took up the idea.
This was announced at the London conference on Syria and a trial will begin during the summer.
The third idea that I want to submit to you is the concept of preference between states and refugees leading to positive outcomes as you see in this selfie featuring Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee.
We rarely ask refugees what they want, where they want to go, but we can do it and it will be better for everyone.
Economist Alvin Roth developed the idea of market matching, where the preference order of the parties determines their potential match.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym have sought ways to apply this idea to refugees, to ask refugees to rank destinations but also to allow states to rank the type of refugees desired based on skills or languages, and then match them.
Of course, quotas regarding diversity and vulnerability should be implemented, but it is a way to increase the chances of matching.
The idea of matching is successfully used, for example, to allocate students at university, match kidney donors and patients, and the algorithm exists on dating sites.
Why not apply this to offer refugees a choice?
This could also be used at the national level where one of the biggest challenges is to persuade local communities to accept refugees.
Currently, in my country, for example, we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the city, which makes no sense.
Matching markets bring together these preferences and listen to the needs and demands of the host population and refugees.
The fourth idea I want to talk about is the principle of humanitarian visa.
The tragedies and disorders observed in Europe could have been avoided.
They stem from a fundamental contradiction in European asylum policy: in order to seek asylum in Europe, you must arrive spontaneously by embarking on a dangerous journey that I have already mentioned.
But why are these journeys necessary in the era of low-cost airlines and modern consular means?
These journeys are not necessary, and last year, they led to the death of more than 3,000 people at the borders of Europe and on European territory.
If refugees had the right to travel directly and seek asylum in Europe, we would avoid this. And we can do this through humanitarian visas that allow people to obtain a visa from an embassy or consulate in a neighboring country and then pay for their journey by ferry or plane to Europe.
It costs around €1,000 to pay a smuggler from Turkey to the Greek islands.
A low-cost flight from Bodrum to Frankfurt costs €200.
If we allowed refugees, this would have major benefits.
This would save lives, reduce the smugglers' market, and mark the end of the disorder seen on the front line in Europe, in areas such as the Greek islands.
It is the laws that prevent us from doing so, not a rational solution.
This is an idea that has been applied.
Brazil has adopted a forward-thinking approach and more than 2,000 Syrians have obtained humanitarian visas, traveled to Brazil, and upon arrival, requested refugee status.
In this setup, every Syrian who did this received refugee status and was recognized as a refugee.
There is a historical precedent.
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports were used as travel documents authorizing 450,000 Assyrians, Turks, and Chechens to travel to Europe and request refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
And the Nansen International Office for Refugees received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this successful strategy.
Each of these four ideas that I have presented to you are ways to expand Amira's choices.
These are ways we have to increase refugees' choices beyond these options, these three impossible options that I detailed for you, while benefiting others.
In conclusion, we need a new perspective, a vision that expands the choices of refugees but recognizes that they do not have to be a burden.
There is nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost.
Yes, they are a humanitarian responsibility, but they are human beings with skills, talents, aspirations, and the ability to contribute, if we allow them to.
In the new world, migration will not stop.
What we have seen in Europe will continue for years.
People will still travel, populations will be displaced, and we must find rational and realistic ways to manage it, not based on old humanitarian aid logics or charity, but built on the opportunities offered by globalization, markets, and mobility.
I urge you to wake up and I urge our politicians to wake up to this challenge.
Thank you very much.
