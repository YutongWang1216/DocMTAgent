When I was little, I used to dream of the ocean.
A wild place, very colorful and full of life, home to bizarre and fantastic creatures.
I imagined large sharks reigning as masters and graceful sea turtles swirling through the corals.
First a marine biologist, then a photographer, I spent most of my career searching for places as magical as those I dreamed of as a child.
As you can see, I started exploring the water at a very young age.
But the first time I really went underwater, I was about 10 years old.
I vividly remember kicking decisively to reach that old cannon embedded in a shallow coral reef.
When I finally managed to catch it, I looked up and found myself surrounded by fish of all the colors of the rainbow.
That day, I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Peschak, a photographer specialized in marine conservation, has had the immense privilege of exploring some of the most incredible marine landscapes over the course of 40 years on Earth for National Geographic and for the Save Our Seas foundation.
I photographed everything, from huge sharks to tiny ones that fit in the palm of your hand.
I felt the fish in the breath of the humpback whales feeding next to me in the cold waters of Canada, near the Great Bear Rainforest.
I even learned all about the mating rituals of the green turtle in the Mozambique Channel.
We all leave a mark on the ocean, and vice versa.
And the pristine seas I dreamed of as a child are becoming increasingly harder to find.
They are always smaller and more threatened.
While we, humans, maintain our role as the planet's top predator, I have witnessed direct repercussions and photographed them.
I have long believed that I must shock my audience with disturbing images to shake them out of their indifference.
This approach has its merits, but I have moved away from it.
In my opinion, the best way to bring about change is to sell love.
If you will, I am a matchmaker, and as a photographer, I have the exceptional opportunity to reveal animals and entire ecosystems located beneath the surface of the ocean.
One cannot love and fight for something if one is unaware of its existence.
Revealing this - that is the full power of marine photography.
Among the hundreds of underwater locations I have seen, a handful of these landscapes have deeply touched me.
I saw the first of these landscapes about 10 years ago, off the wild and rugged coast of South Africa.
Every summer, huge shoals of sardines move north, a mass migration phenomenon called the Sardine Run.
A mad rush of these fish
where hordes of hungry and agile predators chase them.
Common dolphins hunt together and succeed in isolating sardines from the main shoal and creating small shoals.
They dive and trap the fish upwards, against the surface, and rush to enjoy their wriggling feast.
The sharks are following closely.
For many people, sharks and dolphins are sworn enemies, but during the Sardine Run, they coexist.
In fact, the dolphins help the sharks feed more efficiently.
Without the dolphins, the small shoals created are more sparse, and the sharks often end up with a "sardine donut" or a mouthful of water.
I've had some lively moments with the sharks during the Sardine Run, but I know they don't see me as prey.
I receive blows and am jostled like all the other participants in this rowdy banquet.
Leaving the African coast behind, let's head east, across the vastness of the Indian Ocean to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands.
During the monsoon season, manta rays from across the archipelago head towards a tiny island in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.
Armies of crustaceans, most smaller than a marble, are the staple food of manta rays.
When plankton concentrations are low, manta rays feed alone and perform backward somersaults in a loop, like a puppy chasing its tail.
When plankton density increases, the rays line up in single file and form these long chains. Each delicious morsel that escapes the first one is gobbled up by the second or the following one.
When the plankton concentration reaches its peak, manta rays swim even closer in a rotating motion through which they feed.
As they whirl in this narrow formation, the column of manta rays creates its own vortex, sucking and bringing the plankton right into the cavernous mouths of the rays.
The experience of diving among these countless rays is absolutely unforgettable.
The first time I photographed Hanifaru, the site was unprotected and threatened by development.
I have worked with NGOs such as Manta Trust, and my photos have helped turn Hanifaru into a marine protected area.
Fishermen from neighboring islands were hunting these manta rays, using their skin to make traditional drums.
Today, they are the most fervent conservators, and manta rays bring more than 8 million dollars to the Maldivian economy each year.
I have always wanted to go back in time and see an era where maps were incomplete or indicated: "Here be dragons".
I got closest to it by visiting these remote atolls in the heart of the Indian Ocean.
Far, far away from the lines of boats and fishing, diving into these waters is a poignant reminder of what our oceans once looked like.
Bassas da India is greatly unknown. It is a tiny coral spot in the Mozambique Channel.
Its barrier forms a shield that protects its inner lagoon, a nursery for the Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are anything but shy, even during the day.
Something told me that they would be even bolder and more numerous at night.
I found myself facing more sharks than ever before, gathered on a simple outcrop.
Photographing and sharing moments like these reminds me why I chose this path.
Not long ago, I was working on a project in Baja California for National Geographic.
Halfway down the Pacific coast lies San Ignacio Lagoon, where the gray whale comes to give birth.
For a century, this coast has been the scene of a systematic massacre, with over 20,000 gray whales being killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
Today, the descendants of these same whales play at the surface with their offspring and even interact with us.
This species has remarkably survived.
On the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo, a sleepy fishing village.
Decades of overfishing have brought them to the brink of collapse.
In 1995, local fishermen convinced the authorities to turn their waters into a marine reserve.
But what happened next was nothing short of a miracle.
In 2005, after just a decade of protection, scientists recorded the largest increase in fish.
But don't just take my word for it, come with me.
In a breath, swim into the depths with me amidst one of the largest and densest schools of fish I have ever encountered.
We all have the opportunity to inspire hope.
And through my photos, I would like to convey the message that it is not too late for our oceans.
And I would like to particularly emphasize the resilience of nature in the face of 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I will have to search diligently to take photos like this one, while creating images that show our respectful coexistence with the ocean,
I hope, will become the daily routine for me.
To thrive and survive in my profession, one must truly be an unwavering optimist.
I always work with the belief that the next fabulous image that will serve my purpose is just around the corner, behind the next reef, at the heart of the next lagoon, or who knows, maybe in the one after that.
