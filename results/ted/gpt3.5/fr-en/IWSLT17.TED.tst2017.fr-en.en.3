At university, I specialized in Political Science, so I had to write a lot of dissertations.
When a regular student writes a dissertation, they spread out the work a bit like this.
You know... You may start slowly, but you write a bit during the first week and combined with more productive days, in the end, everything is done and everyone stays calm.
And I would like to do that like this.
That would be the goal. Everything would be prepared. But when the dissertation comes, I do it.
And it's like this for every dissertation.
Then came my 90-page final year thesis, a document on which you are supposed to work for a year.
I knew that for such a dissertation, my usual pace was not sustainable.
So I planned everything, and I decided that I had to achieve something like this.
The year was going to unfold like this.
So I was going to start light, and I was going to increase in the middle months, and in the end, I was going to step up the pace, like a small staircase.
Climbing stairs, where is the difficulty?
It's not a big deal, is it?
But then, something funny happened.
These first months?
They arrived and passed, and I couldn't really work.
So we have a great revised plan.
And then... But then, those middle months arrived and I didn't really write a word, so we were here.
Then, two months turn into one month, which turns into two weeks.
And one day, I wake up with three days before the deadline, still not having written a word. So I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours, with not one, but two sleepless nights. Humans are not made to go through two sleepless nights. I ran through the campus, dived in slow motion, and handed in the dissertation just before the deadline.
I thought it was the end of all this.
But a week later, I received a phone call from the university.
And they say, "Tim Urban?"
And I replied, "Yes."
"We need to talk about your thesis."
"Okay."
And they say, "It's the best we've ever seen."
It's not true.
It was a very, very bad thesis.
I just wanted to savor that unique moment when you all thought, "This guy is fantastic!"
No, it was very, very bad.
Today, I am writing a blog.
I am writing the Wait But Why blog.
A few years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.
My behavior has always puzzled non-procrastinators around me. I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in our minds, why we are like this.
I had a hypothesis that the brain of procrastinators is actually different from the brain of other people.
To test this, I found a laboratory with an MRI scanner that allowed me to scan my brain and that of a confirmed non-procrastinator, so that I could compare them.
I brought them here to show them to you today.
I want you to look carefully to identify a difference.
I know that if you are not brain experts, it's not so obvious, but try.
So here is the brain of a non-procrastinator.
Now...
Here is my brain.
There is a difference.
Both brains have a Rational Decision Maker, but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.
What does this mean for the procrastinator?
This means that everything is fine until this happens.
So the Rational Decision Maker will make the rational decision to do something productive. But the Monkey doesn't like this plan, so he takes the wheel and says, "Actually, let's go read the entire Wikipedia page on the Nancy Kerrigan/Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that."
So... So we go to the fridge to see if there's anything new since the last 10 minutes.
After that, we embark on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman on magnets and ends much, much later with interviews of Justin Bieber's mother.
"All of this will take time so we won't have time to work today. Sorry!"
What is happening here?
The Monkey doesn't seem like someone you want at the wheel.
He lives entirely in the present moment.
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he is only interested in two things: ease and fun.
In the animal world, it works correctly.
If you are a dog and spend your life doing only easy and fun things, you are fantastic!
For the Monkey, humans are just another animal species.
You had to sleep, eat, and create a new generation. This could work in prehistoric times.
But if you haven't noticed, we don't live in prehistoric times.
We live in an advanced civilization, and the Monkey doesn't know what that is.
That's why we have another person in our brain, the Rational Decision Maker, who gives us the ability to do things that no other animal can do.
One can project themselves into the future.
One can have an overview of the situation.
One can make long-term plans.
And he wants to take all of this into account.
And he wants us to do just what is logical, here and now.
Sometimes it makes sense to do easy and fun things, like when you have dinner or go to bed or enjoy some well-deserved free time.
There is an overlap. Sometimes they agree.
But on other occasions, it is much more logical to do more difficult and less enjoyable things, in the interest of the situation as a whole.
A conflict is then created.
For the procrastinator, this conflict tends to end in the same way every time, leaving them spending a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place, completely outside the Circle of Logic.
I call it the Dark Playground.
The Dark Playground is a place that all procrastinators know very well.
It's the place where we engage in leisure activities at times when they should not take place.
The fun you have on the Dark Playground is not actually fun, as it is undeserved and the air is filled with guilt, fear, anxiety, self-disgust, all these feelings of a good procrastinator.
In this situation, with the Monkey at the wheel, the question is: how can the procrastinator get to the blue zone, a less enjoyable place, but where the really important things get done?
It turns out that the procrastinator has a guardian angel. Someone who always watches over them in their worst moments. Someone called the Panic Monster.
The Panic Monster sleeps most of the time, but wakes up suddenly every time a deadline approaches too closely or there is a risk of public embarrassment, a career disaster, or any other terrible consequence.
And most importantly, it's the only thing the Monkey is afraid of.
It became very relevant in my life very recently, when the people from TED contacted me six months ago and invited me to give a presentation.
Of course, I said yes.
It has always been my dream to have given a presentation for TED.
In the midst of this excitement, the Rational Decision Maker seemed to have something else on his mind.
He said, "Do you understand what you have agreed to?"
Do you understand what is about to happen now?
We need to sit down and work on this now.
And the Monkey said, "Totally agree, but let's open Google Earth and look at the south of India, like 50 meters above the ground, and scroll the map for 2.5 hours, until we reach the north of the country, to better understand India."
That's what we did that day.
As six months turned into four, then two, and finally one month, the people at TED decided to release the names of the speakers.
I opened the website and saw my face looking back at me.
And guess who woke up?
The Panic Monster starts to lose its mind, and a few seconds later, it's chaos throughout the entire system.
And the Monkey, remember, is terrified of the Panic Monster Boom, there he is at the top of the tree!
And finally, the Rational Decision Maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the presentation.
The Panic Monster explains much of the rather foolish behavior of the procrastinator, like how someone like me can spend two weeks unable to start a sentence of a dissertation and miraculously find the incredible work ethic to stay awake all night to write 8 pages.
All this situation, with these three characters, is the procrastinator's system.
It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.
That's what I decided to write about on the blog a few years ago.
When I did it, I was amazed by the responses.
Thousands of emails arrived, from all over the world, from all kinds of people, doing all kinds of things.
There were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and many, many PhD candidates.
They all wrote to say the same thing: "I have this problem too."
But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the article and the heavy tone of these emails.
These people wrote with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives, about what the Monkey had done to them.
I thought about it and said: if the procrastinator's system works, where is the problem?
Why do these people feel so bad?
Apparently, there are two types of procrastination.
The examples I have given today all have a deadline.
If there is a deadline, the effects of procrastination are contained in the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved.
But there is a second type that occurs in situations without a deadline.
If you want a career as a freelancer, in the arts or entrepreneurship, at the beginning, there is no deadline for these things because nothing happens until you start the hard work to gain momentum for things to move forward. Full of important things
outside of your career have no deadline, such as your family, your health, exercising, working on your romantic relationship, or getting out of it when it's not working.
If the procrastinator's only mechanism for doing difficult things is the Panic Monster, it's a problem because in all these deadline-less situations, it's not there, it has no reason to wake up. The effects of procrastination are not contained and spread infinitely.
It's this type of long-term procrastination that is much less visible and talked about much less than the more amusing, short-term one based on deadlines.
It is often suffered in silence and in private.
It can be a source of a huge amount of pain and regret.
That's why these people were sending me those emails and why they felt so bad.
It's not that they were cramming on certain projects.
Long-term procrastination has sometimes turned them into spectators of their own lives.
The frustration is not that they cannot achieve their dreams, it is that they cannot even take the first step.
So I read these emails and I had a sort of revelation: I don't think non-procrastinators exist.
That's true. I think you are all procrastinators.
You may not all be in a bad state like some of us... ...and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines. But remember: the Monkey's greatest trap comes when deadlines don't exist.
I want to show you one last thing.
I call it the Calendar of Life.
One square for each week for a 90-year life.
It doesn't represent that many squares, especially when you've already used quite a few.
I think we should all take a close look at this calendar.
We need to think about the topics on which we procrastinate because everyone procrastinates on something in their life.
We must remain aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey.
It's a task for each one of us.
There aren't that many squares, so it's a task that should probably start today.
Actually, maybe not today...
You know...
Soon.
Thank you.
