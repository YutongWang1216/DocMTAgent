Off the cuff: how many of you have already unfriended someone on Facebook because they made an offensive remark about politics, religion, parenting, food?
How many of you avoid at least one person just to avoid having to talk to them?
Before, to have a polite conversation, one followed Henry Higgins' advice in "My Fair Lady": stick to the weather and your health.
But nowadays, with climate change and the anti-vaccination movement, these topics... are no longer very safe.
The world we live in, this world where any conversation can potentially evolve into controversy, where our politicians cannot talk to each other, and where even the most trivial subjects have supporters and detractors, this world is not normal.
Pew Research conducted a study on 10,000 American adults and found that, currently, we are more polarized, more divided, than ever before.
We make fewer compromises, which means that we do not listen to each other.
We decide where to live, who to marry, and even who our friends will be, based on our already established convictions.
Once again, this does not mean that we do not listen to each other.
A conversation requires a balance between speaking and listening, and somewhere along the way, we have lost this balance.
It is partly due to technology.
The cell phones that you all have, either in your hands or close enough to grab quickly.
According to Pew Research, about a third of American teenagers send more than 100 text messages per day.
Many of them, the majority in fact, will probably send a text message to their friends rather than talk to them face to face.
There is a great article in the magazine "The Atlantic".
written by Paul Barnwell, a high school teacher.
His students did a communication project.
He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific topic without notes.
He said this: "I realized..."
"I realized that the ability to hold a conversation is perhaps the skill that is most neglected to teach."
Children spend hours engaging in dialogue and exchanging ideas through screens, but they rarely have the opportunity to refine their interpersonal communication skills.
It may sound strange, but we must ask ourselves: in the 21st century, what skill is more important than knowing how to hold a coherent conversation?
My job is to talk to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers.
I talk to people that I like and to others that I do not like.
I talk to people with whom I deeply disagree.
But I always have fantastic conversations with them.
For the next 10 minutes, I would like to teach you how to speak and listen.
Many of you have already heard advice on this: look people in the eyes, think in advance about interesting topics to discuss, look, nod and smile to show your attention, repeat what you heard or summarize it.
Forget all that.
It's crap.
There is no need to learn how to demonstrate that you are attentive, if you are actually attentive.
I use exactly the same skills as a professional interviewer as I do in my daily life.
So I will teach you how to question people and it will help you learn how to be better communicators.
Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time, without getting bored, and above all, without offending anyone.
We have all had extraordinary conversations before.
We have had them. We know what it's like.
The kind of conversation that makes you feel engaged and inspired, or that gives you the impression of having truly created a connection, or of having been perfectly understood.
There is no reason why the majority of our conversations should not be like this.
I have 10 basic rules. I will explain them to you, but honestly, if you take one and fully master it, you will already have better conversations.
Number 1: no multitasking.
Not just putting down your phone, tablet, or car keys, or whatever you have in your hand.
Be present.
Live in the moment.
Don't think about the argument with your boss,
nor about what you're going to eat tonight.
If you want to end the conversation, do so, but don't be only halfway present.
Number 2: don't preach.
If you want to express your opinion without any opportunity to respond, discuss, react, or grow, write a blog.
I have a very good reason for not inviting critics to my show: they are very boring.
Conservatives will hate Obama, food stamps, and abortion.
Liberals will hate big banks, the oil industry, and Dick Cheney.
Completely predictable.
You do not want to be like this.
You must start every conversation with the idea that you are going to learn something.
Scott Peck, the famous therapist, said that for true listening, one must fade away.
It sometimes means putting aside one's own opinion.
He said that the speaker will feel this acceptance, and will become less and less vulnerable, and will more likely offer the hidden corners of his mind to the listener.
Consider that you have things to learn.
Bill Nye: "Every person knows something that you do not."
I say it like this: every person is an expert in something.
Number 3: Ask open-ended questions.
For that, be inspired by journalists.
Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why, or how.
If you ask a complex question, the answer will be simple.
If I ask you, "Were you terrified?"
You will respond to the most powerful word in this sentence, here "terrified," and the answer will be yes or no.
"Were you angry?" "Yes, very angry."
Let them describe. They are the ones who know.
Ask questions like: "How was it?"
"What did you feel?"
Because they might need a moment to think, and you will then have a much more interesting answer.
Number 4: go with the flow.
It means that ideas will come to mind and you must let them out of your mind.
We have often heard interviews where the guest speaks for several minutes, then the host takes back the floor and asks a question that seems to come out of nowhere, or to which an answer has already been given.
The host probably stopped listening 2 minutes ago because he was thinking about his next question, a very clever question that he was determined to ask.
We do the same thing.
We are sitting, having a discussion with someone, and then we remember our meeting with Hugh Jackman in a caf√©.
We stop listening.
Stories and ideas will come to you.
You must let them come, and then go.
Number 5: if you don't know, say that you don't know.
People on the radio, particularly on NPR, are more aware that what they say is being recorded; therefore, they are more cautious when discussing their expertise and what they are certain they know.
Do the same. Err on the side of caution.
Speech should not be taken lightly.
Rule 6: Do not compare your experience to theirs.
If they talk about the loss of a family member, do not talk about the loss of a family member in your family.
If they talk about the issues they have at work, do not tell them that you hate your job.
It's not the same thing, never.
Every experience is unique.
More importantly, it's not about you.
There is no need to use this moment to prove how great you are or how much you have suffered.
Someone asked Stephen Hawking for his IQ, to which he replied, "No idea. Those who boast about their IQ are losers."
Conversations are not promotional opportunities.
Number 7: try not to repeat yourself.
It is condescending and very boring, and we tend to do it.
Especially during conversations at work, or with our children, we have a message to convey so we tirelessly rephrase it.
Don't do it.
Number 8: Spare the details.
Honestly, regardless of the years, names, dates, and all those details you can't seem to remember.
It doesn't matter. What matters is you.
People are interested in you, in what you have in common.
Forget the details. Leave them aside.
Number 9: it's not the last one, but it's the most important.
Listen.
I can't tell you how many important people have said that listening may be the most important skill to develop.
Buddha said, and I paraphrase: "If your mouth is open, you are not learning."
And Calvin Coolidge said, "No one ever got fired for listening."
Why do we not listen to ourselves?
First, we prefer to talk.
When I speak, I am in control.
I don't have to listen to what doesn't interest me.
I am the center of attention.
I can highlight my identity.
But that's not all: we let ourselves get distracted.
We speak an average of 225 words per minute, but can listen to up to 500.
So our minds fill in with another 275 words.
I know it takes effort and energy to focus our attention on someone, but if you don't do it, it's not a conversation,
but rather two people shouting barely connected phrases in the same place.
You must listen to each other.
Stephen Covey said it very well:
"Many of us do not listen to understand.
We listen to respond.
One last rule, number 10: be concise.
[A good conversation is like a miniskirt: short enough to keep attention, and long enough to cover the subject. - My sister] It all comes back to a basic concept: show interest in others.
I grew up with a very famous grandfather and there was a ritual in my home.
People would come to talk to my grandparents and after they left, my mother would come to us and say, "Do you know who that was?
She was the Miss America finalist.
He was the mayor of Sacramento.
She won a Pulitzer Prize. He is a Russian ballet dancer.
So I grew up believing that everyone has a hidden and truly great side.
I believe that makes me a better host.
I keep my mouth shut as much as possible, I keep an open mind, and I am always ready to be amazed, and I am never disappointed.
Do the same.
Go talk to people, listen to them, and, above all, be ready to be amazed.
Thank you.
