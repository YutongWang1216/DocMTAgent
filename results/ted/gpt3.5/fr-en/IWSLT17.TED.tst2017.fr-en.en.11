You probably do not know Kenema in Sierra Leone, or Arua in Nigeria.
For me, these are the two most extraordinary places on Earth.
There, in the hospitals, there is a community of nurses, doctors, and scientists who have calmly fought one of the deadliest threats to humanity for years: the Lassa virus.
The Lassa virus is similar to the Ebola virus.
It can cause a high fever and can often be fatal.
But these people risk their lives every day, to protect individuals in their communities, and ultimately, to protect us all.
One of the most extraordinary things I learned about them, during one of my early visits, a long time ago, was that they start each morning - these difficult mornings on the front lines - by singing.
They gather together, and they show their joy and their strength.
Over the years, we visited each other. I could be among them, sing, and write. It was extraordinary, because it reminds us that we are not only there for science, but that we are connected by a shared humanity.
You can imagine, it is extremely important, vital even, when things started to change.
The situation changed in March 2014, when the Ebola epidemic was declared in Guinea.
It was the first epidemic in West Africa, near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
It was frightening... We were all terrified.
We had suspected for some time that the Lassa and Ebola viruses were more widespread than previously thought, that they could reach Kenema.
So, members of my team immediately joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team in the field. We set up diagnostics to perform molecular tests capable of detecting the arrival of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
We had already managed to control the Lassa virus. We knew what to do, the team was remarkable.
We simply had to provide them with the tools and the lab for Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day has come.
On May 23, 2014, a woman arrived at the maternity ward of the hospital. The team conducted molecular tests and identified the first case of the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone.
It was an exceptional work.
They were able to diagnose the case immediately, treat the patient safely, and begin to understand what was happening.
It could have prevented what happened.
But the day it happened, the epidemic had been brewing for several months.
There were already hundreds of cases, surpassing all previous outbreaks.
She entered Sierra Leone, not as this singular case, but like a tidal wave.
We worked with the international community, the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to treat the cases. The following week there were 31, then 92, then 147 cases, all coming to Kenema, one of the few places in Sierra Leone that could address this issue.
We worked tirelessly, trying everything possible to help each person and attract attention. We also did something else:
We did not discard the blood tests, used to detect Ebola, we put them in a chemical to deactivate them. We packaged them and shipped them across the ocean.
We sent them to Boston, where my team works.
We also worked tirelessly, day after day. We quickly generated 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
The genome is the architect's blueprint of a virus.
We all have one.
It indicates what we are made of, and it conveys so much information about us.
The results of this kind of work are straightforward and very useful.
We took these 99 different viruses, observed and compared them, and found that, when compared to the three genomes previously published in Guinea, the epidemic had emerged in Guinea several months earlier, and that once in humans, it was transmitted from human to human.
This is very important when we want to determine how to intervene, as contact tracing is crucial.
It was also discovered that the virus was mutating as it moved between humans.
Each mutation is important because diagnostics, vaccines, and our therapies are all based on the genome sequence. It is the guide.
Global health experts need to react, develop, and recalibrate all their work accordingly.
But science doesn't work that way. My position at the time was that I had the data and could have worked in isolation for months, carefully analyzing the data, slowly submitting an article for publication, making some changes, and finally publishing my data after the official publication.
That's how the status quo in science works.
This time, no way to act like that.
We had friends on the ground. For us, it was obvious that we needed help, a lot of help...
The first thing we did, as soon as the machine output the first sequences, was to publish them on the web.
We published them and launched a call for help.
And help arrived!
Quickly, many people contacted us, surprised by the data we had published.
Some of the world's leading infectious disease specialists were part of our community.
We worked together virtually, sharing regular calls, trying to track the virus minute by minute, to see how to stop it.
There are so many ways to build such communities.
Everyone, when the epidemic began to spread globally, wanted to learn, participate, and get involved.
Everyone wanted to play a role.
The number of volunteers was incredible, and the Internet connected us all.
Can you imagine that instead of being afraid of each other, we said, "OK, let's go, by working together,
we will defeat this virus.
The issue was that the data we were using, while conducting research on the web, was too limited for our objective.
We waste a lot of opportunities in these cases.
Therefore, when the epidemic broke out in Kenema, we had 106 clinical records of patients, and we made them public.
In our lab, we demonstrated that, armed with these 106 records, we could teach our computers to predict Ebola with an accuracy of around 100%.
We have developed an application that provides access to this information to healthcare workers on site.
Unfortunately, 106 cases are not sufficient to consolidate and validate the data.
So we were waiting for more data.
But we were still waiting for the data.
We are still waiting, confined in our silos, instead of working together.
This situation is no longer tolerable.
You, all of you, you can no longer accept this.
It is our lives that are at stake.
Many people have lost their lives, including healthcare workers, including colleagues who were dear to me. Five colleagues lost their lives: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Koroma, and Mohamed Fullah.
These are just five among many others in Kenema and beyond, who died, while the world waited and we worked, quietly and separately.
Ebola, like all threats to humanity, is fueled by mistrust, confusion, and division.
While we build barriers between us, the virus spreads.
Contrary to all other threats, in the face of Ebola, we are all equal.
We are all in the same boat.
Ebola is at our doorstep, for all of us.
And so in this place, we share the same vulnerabilities, strengths, fears, and hopes, I wish that we can work together and with pleasure.
One of my former students was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and she discovered that the term "Kenema", the hospital where we work, in Sierra Leone, comes from the Mende quote meaning "clear as a river, translucent and open to view".
It held a special meaning for us, as, unknowingly, we had always believed that to honor the individuals in Kenema, we must work openly and together.
We must do it.
We must all demand from ourselves and others to be open to each other when an epidemic occurs, and to fight it together.
Because this is neither the first Ebola epidemic nor the last, and there are many other pathogens lurking around us, such as the Lassa virus.
The next epidemic could affect a city of millions of inhabitants.
It could start there and be transmitted through the air.
It could even be intentionally disseminated.
I know it's scary, I understand ... but I also know, this experience proves it to us, that we have the technology and the capacity to overcome, to defeat and get ahead of other viruses.
But it is only possible if we collaborate joyfully.
For Dr. Khan, and for all those who have given their lives on the front lines in this battle with us, let us stand by their side in this fight. Always.
Let us not leave the world with the scars of destruction caused by a virus. Let us illuminate it with the radiance of billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
Thank you.
