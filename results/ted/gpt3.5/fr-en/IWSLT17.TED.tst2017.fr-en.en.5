The food crisis
is in the news every day.
But what is it?
In some parts of the world, there is too little food, or maybe too much.
Elsewhere, GMOs are saving the world.
Maybe GMOs are the problem?
Too much agricultural runoff creates toxic oceans, leading to a decrease in food supply.
And so on.
I find the current climate of this discussion incredibly discouraging.
How can we bring this topic back to something that we understand?
What does this apple tell us about the food crisis?
You all ate an apple last week, I'm sure of it.
How old do you think she was when she was picked?
Two weeks?
Two months?
Eleven months. That's the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the United States.
And I don't think it's very different in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
We pick them, we put them in refrigerated warehouses, we gas the warehouses. There are actually documented evidence of workers trying to enter these environments to retrieve an apple, and dying because the atmosphere to slow down the apple's ripening is toxic to humans.
How is it that none of you knew?
Why didn't I know?
90% of the quality of this apple, all the antioxidants, are gone when it arrives at our homes.
In fact, it's now just a small ball of sugar.
How do we have so little information and how can we do better?
I think what is missing is a platform.
I know platforms. I know computers. I was stuck in front of the Internet when I was young.
I did some very strange things... ... on this platform.
But I met people, and I could express myself.
How can one express themselves in food?
If we had a platform, we could feel capable of asking: If only?
I wondered: What if... the climate was democratic?
So, here is a map of the climate around the world.
The most productive areas in green, the least productive in red.
They change, they are replaced, and now Californian farmers are Mexican.
China is taking land from Brazil to cultivate better food, and we are slaves to the climate.
What if each country had its own productive climate?
How would that change the way we live?
How would that change the quality of life and food?
The issue of the previous generation was to have more food and to have it at a lower cost.
Welcome to your global farm.
We have built a massive analog farm.
All these lines are the cars, planes, trains, and transports.
It is a miracle that we feed seven billion people with only a few of us involved in food production.
And what would happen if...
What if we built a digital farm?
A global digital farm.
And what if you could take this apple, digitize it in a way, send it as particles through the air, and reconstruct it on the other side?
What would happen?
Let's go over a few quotes. They inspire me in what I do.
The first one: "Japanese agriculture has no childhood, no water, no land, and no future." That's what I discovered when I went to Minamisanriku, south of Fukushima, after the disaster.
The children have left for Sendai and Tokyo, the land is contaminated, they already import 70% of their own food.
But this is not only about Japan.
2% of the American population is involved in agriculture.
What good response can come from only 2% of the population?
Traveling around the world, 50% of the African population is under 18 years old.
80% of them do not want to become farmers.
Farming is challenging.
The life of a small agricultural entrepreneur is miserable.
They are heading towards the city.
In India, farmers do not have access to basic services. There have been more farmer suicides this year than in the previous 10 years.
It is uncomfortable to talk about it.
Where are they going?
To the city.
There are no more young people, and everyone is leaving.
So, how can we build a platform that would inspire the youth?
Welcome to the new tractor.
This is my combine harvester.
A few years ago, I went to Bed Bath & Beyond, and Home Depot, and started hacking.
I built stupid things, I made the plants dance, I connected them to my computer, and I killed them all; I killed a lot of them.
I finally managed to make them live.
And I created one of the most intimate relationships of my entire existence, because I was learning the language of plants.
I wanted to do something bigger.
I was told, "Enjoy yourself, young man!
Here is an old electronics lab that no one wants.
What can you do?"
With my team, we built a farm inside the Media Lab, a renowned place, not for biology, but rather for computer science.
Within these 6 mÂ², we have produced enough food to feed approximately 300 people once a month. It is a small amount of food.
There are plenty of interesting technologies in there.
But the most interesting thing?
Beautiful roots, white, deep green colors, and a monthly harvest.
Is it a new cafeteria?
Is this a new retail experience?
Is this a new grocery store?
I can assure you of one thing: it's the first time anyone in the Media Lab has pulled out the roots of anything.
We have bagged salads, there is nothing wrong with that.
But what happens when you have an image processing expert, a data specialist, a roboticist, pulling out roots and thinking, "I know a bit about this. I can do it, I want to try."
In this setting, we would grow the plants and bring some back to the laboratory, because if you grow them, you don't throw them away, you become attached to them.
I have strange taste buds now; I'm afraid to let anyone eat something without tasting it first, because I want it to be good.
I eat lettuce every day and I can give its pH within 0.1 accuracy.
And I say, "No, its pH is 6.1, you can't eat it today."
That lettuce that day was extremely sweet.
It was extremely sweet because the plant was stressed and had triggered a chemical reaction in itself to protect itself: "I'm not going to die!"
And the plants that don't want to die, seem sweet to me.
Technologists are amazed by plant physiology.
We thought that other people should be able to try.
We wanted to see what people can create, we designed a laboratory that can be shipped anywhere.
Then we built it.
On the facade of the Media Lab, there is my laboratory, which has around 30 detection points per plant.
If you know the genome or genetics, that's the phenome, okay?
The phenomena.
When you say, "I love Mexican strawberries," you really love the strawberries from the climate that produced the flavor you enjoy.
So, if you encode the climate - this amount of CO2 and this amount of oxygen create a recipe - you encode the expression of this plant, the nutrition of this plant, the size of this plant, the shape, the color, the texture.
We need data, so we have placed a bunch of sensors to tell us what is happening.
Think about your indoor plants! You are super sad because you are wondering, "Why are you dying? Why don't you talk to me?"
Farmers acquire a unique ability when they reach the age of 60 or 70.
They can tell when a plant is dying due to a nitrogen deficiency, a calcium deficiency, or needing more water.
This unique ability is not passed down.
Here are the omens of the "farmer in the cloud".
We track these data over time.
We correlate them with specific plants.
These are all the broccoli in my laboratory, by IP address.
Our broccoli can be reached by IP address.
And if that's not weird enough, you click once and get the profile of a plant.
And it gives you the downloadable evolution of this plant, but not as you might think, not just when it is ready.
When will it reach the nutrition I need?
When will it reach the desired taste?
Is she receiving too much water?
Is she receiving too much sunlight?
Alerts.
She can talk to me, she communicates, we have a language.
I think she is the first user of the Facebook of plants!
This is her plant profile, and this plant will start making friends.
I believe it: she will become friends with other plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, and less potassium.
We will learn more about a complexity that we could only assume.
Maybe they won't become our friends, maybe they will, it will depend on us.
This is my laboratory.
It is a little more organized, my job is to design data centers for hospitals, so I am very familiar with creating controlled environments.
And so, within this environment, we experiment with all sorts of things.
This process, aeroponic, was developed by NASA for the Mir space station to reduce the amount of water sent into space.
This process gives the plant exactly what it wants: water, minerals, and oxygen.
The roots are not so complicated. When you give them that, you get an amazing result.
It's as if the plant had two hearts.
And because it has two hearts, it grows four or five times faster.
It's a perfect world.
We have made progress in technology and seeds for an unfavorable world, and we will continue to do so, but we also have a new tool, which is a perfect world.
We have grown all kinds of things.
These tomatoes had not been produced and sold for 150 years.
Did you know that we have banks of rare and ancient seeds?
Seed banks.
It's incredible.
They have a genetic material, things you have never eaten.
I am the only person in this room who has eaten this kind of tomato.
It's a tomato for sauce that we don't know how to cook. We ate this tomato. And it wasn't great.
We have done things with proteins, all kinds of things.
We have grown humans. Maybe you would do it, but we didn't.
What we have realized is... that the tool was too big and too expensive.
I began distributing it around the world, and it cost about $100,000.
Finding someone with $100,000 in their pocket is not easy, so we tried to make it smaller.
It was the project of one of my undergraduate mechanical engineering students, Camille.
Camille and I, along with the whole team, spent the entire summer trying to figure out how to make it cheaper, work better, and enable others to do it.
We placed them in schools, from sixth grade to twelfth grade.
And if you want to remain humble, try teaching children.
I went to the school and said, "Set the humidity to 65%."
A middle school student asked me, "What is humidity?"
I replied, "Water in the air."
He said, "There is no water in the air, you are an idiot."
And I replied, "Very well...
Don't trust me.
Set it to 100."
He sets it to 100, and what happens?
It starts to condense, create fog, and eventually, droplets form.
And he said, "Oh. Humidity is rain."
Why didn't you tell me?
We created an interface like a game.
They have a 3D environment, and can connect from anywhere in the world using their smartphone or tablet.
They have the different parts of the bots, the sensors.
They choose recipes created by other children from around the world.
They select and activate this recipe, they plant a seedling.
While it grows, they make changes.
"Why does a plant need CO2?
Is CO2 bad? It kills people!
Increase the CO2, the plant dies.
Reduce the CO2, the plant will be fine.
Harvest the plant, you have just created a new digital recipe.
It is a design, an iterative development, and an exploration process.
They can download all the data on this new plant they have developed or the new digital recipe and what it has done - was it better or worse?
Imagine this as the little hearts of the process.
We are going to learn so much.
Here is one of the food computers, as we call them, in a school after three weeks.
It's three weeks of growth.
But more importantly, it was the first time this kid thought he could be a farmer - or that he might want to be a farmer.
We made everything open source.
Everything is online; try to build your first food computer.
It's going to be difficult - I'm telling you.
We are at the beginning, but everything is there.
It is very important to me that it is easily accessible.
We will continue to move in this direction.
These are farmers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, plant scientists, economists, urban planners,
on a single platform, doing what they are good at.
But we have seen a bit too big.
This is my new setup that we just launched.
This warehouse could be anywhere.
That's why I chose it.
And inside this warehouse, we are going to build something a little like this.
Those already exist.
Look.
These also exist.
One allows for growing greens, the other allows for producing the Ebola vaccine.
It's cool that this factory, the grand winner of the DARPA challenge, is one of the reasons for progress on Ebola.
The factories produce the protein that resists the Ebola virus.
From pharmaceutical products, nutraceuticals, to simple lettuce.
But these two things are in no way similar, and that's where I excel in my field.
Everything is different.
We are at this strange stage of "We're almost there." It's a bit like, "Here's my black box." - No, buy mine.
- No, no - I have the intellectual property, completely valid.
Don't buy his, buy mine.
In fact, we are just at the beginning, at a time when society is also changing.
As we ask for more food but cheaper, we demand better nutrition that respects the environment.
When you have a McDonald's ad explaining what's in the McNuggets - the most mysterious food product of all time - on which their marketing campaign is based, everything is changing.
From now on,
Personal food computers, food servers, and food data centers operate on open-source technology.
Think open genome, but we're going to add small climate recipes, like Wikipedia, that you can retrieve, update, and grow.
What does this look like in reality?
Do you remember the planet connected by lines?
We are starting to have the tags.
We are starting to send information about food, rather than sending food.
This is not only my dream, these are the places where we are already deploying.
Food computers, food servers, soon food data centers, connecting people to share information.
The future of food is not to fight against what is wrong.
We know what is wrong.
The future of food is about networking the next billion farmers and empowering them through a platform to ask and answer the question, "What if?"
Thank you.
