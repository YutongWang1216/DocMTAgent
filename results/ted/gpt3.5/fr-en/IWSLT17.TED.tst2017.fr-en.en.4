We were there, souls and bodies packed into a church in Texas, on the last night of our lives.
Packed into a room just like this one, but with old wooden benches draped in worn red fabric, an organ to my left and a choir behind me, the baptismal font set into the wall behind it.
A room like this one, nevertheless.
With the same overwhelming sense of suspense, the same deep hopes of salvation, the same sweat in the palms, and the same people in the back not listening.
We were on December 31, 1999, the night of the second coming of Christ, and the end of the world as I knew it.
I had turned 12 that year, and I had reached the age of responsibility.
After I stopped complaining about the injustice of Jesus' return at the moment when I was supposed to be held accountable for my actions, I understood that it was better for me to clean up quickly.
I went to church as often as possible.
I awaited the silence with the anxiety of someone who would await noise, trying to make sure that the Lord had not played a trick on me and decided to return earlier.
And in case He returned earlier, I had anticipated a backup plan by reading the "Left Behind" series that were a hit at the time.
I found in their pages that if I wasn't taken at midnight, I had another chance.
All I had to do was avoid taking the mark of the beast, fight demons, plagues, and the Antichrist himself.
It would be difficult - but I knew I was capable of it.
But it was no longer the time to organize.
It was 11:50 PM.
We had 10 minutes left, and my pastor called us to the altar because he wanted to pray when midnight struck.
Each faction of the congregation took their place.
The choir stayed in the choir, the deacons and their wives - or the Baptist Bourgeoisie, as I like to call them - took their place in the front row facing the altar.
You see, in the United States, even the second coming of Christ has a VIP section.
And just behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie were the elderly - those men and women whose backs had once bent under the hot sun of the cotton fields of East Texas, whose skins seemed marked with a smooth and noble brown, just like the clay of East Texas, whose hopes and dreams about the future of their lives outside of East Texas had sometimes been shattered,
deeper than their backs.
Yes, these men and women were the stars of the show for me.
They had been waiting for this moment all their lives, just like their predecessors from the Middle Ages eagerly awaited the end of the world, and like my grandmother awaited the Oprah Winfrey Show on Channel 8 every day at 4 p.m.
And as she headed towards the altar, I hid behind her, as I was absolutely certain that my grandmother would go to Heaven.
And I thought that if I held her hand tightly during the prayer, it was possible that I would go with her.
So I held her hand, and I closed my eyes, to listen, to wait.
The prayers became stronger.
And the cries in response to the prayer call rose even higher.
The organ joined the funeral atmosphere.
And the rising heat joined the sweat.
My hand tightened its grip, so as not to be the one left behind.
I closed my eyes tighter, so as not to see the separation of the wheat from the tares.
Then a voice rose above us: "Amen."
It was over.
I looked at the clock.
It was past midnight.
I looked at the older believers, whose Savior had not come, who were too proud to show their disappointment, who had believed too much and for too long to start doubting now.
But I was annoyed for them.
They had been deceived, tricked, hoodwinked, and I had let myself get carried away with them.
I had said their prayers, I had not given in to the temptation of the best that I could.
I had not dipped my head once, but twice, in those baptismal fonts that gave me a cold.
I had believed.
And now what?
I arrived home in time to turn on the television and watch Peter Jennings announce the new millennium as it progressed around the world.
I was struck by the peculiarity of the multiple returns of Jesus, based on different time zones.
And I felt even more ridiculous - hurt, truly.
But that night, I did not stop believing.
I just started to believe a new thing: that it was possible not to believe.
It was possible that the answers were wrong, that the questions themselves were wrong.
Now, where there had been a mountain of certainty, there was, rushing towards its base, a source of doubt, a source promising rivers.
I can trace back the entire drama of my life to that night, in that church, when my Savior did not come for me; when what I truly believed in had proven to be, if not a lie, at least not quite the truth.
Although some have prepared for the year 2000 in a very different way, I am convinced that you are here because a part of you has done the same thing as me since the beginning of this new century, since my mother left, my father did not return, and my Lord refused to come.
And I reached out my hand, in order to grasp onto something to believe in.
I persevered when I arrived at Yale at 18, confident that my journey from Oak Cliff, Texas, was an opportunity to leave behind all the hardships I had experienced, the shattered dreams and bodies I had seen.
But when I found myself at home during winter break, face down on the floor, hands tied behind my back, and a burglar's gun to my head, I knew that even the best education couldn't save me.
I persevered when I arrived at Lehman Brothers as an intern in 2008.
So full of hope - I called my family to inform them that we would never be poor again.
But when I saw this temple of finance collapse before my eyes, I knew that even the best job couldn't save me.
I persevered when I arrived in Washington as a young employee, who had heard a voice from Illinois saying, "We have waited for a long time, but with this election, change has come to the United States."
But when Congress froze, the country tore apart, and hope and change sounded like a joke, I knew that not even the political second coming could save me.
I had faithfully knelt at the altar of the American Dream, praying to the gods of my time, gods of success, money, and power.
But time and time again, midnight struck, and I opened my eyes to witness the death of all these gods.
From that graveyard, I began to search once more, not out of courage, but because I knew that either I believed, or I died.
So I embarked on a pilgrimage, once again to another Mecca, Harvard Business School - knowing this time that I could not simply accept the salvation it claimed to offer.
No, I knew there would be more work to be done.
The work began late, in a dark corner of a crowded party, on a bleak and early winter night in Cambridge, when three friends and I wondered what young people seeking authenticity have wondered for a long time: "What if we hit the road?"
We didn't know where to go or how to get there, but we knew we had to do it.
All our lives, we longed, as Jack Kerouac wrote, to "slip into the night and disappear somewhere," and go see what everyone was doing all over the country.
Although other voices said that the risk was too great and the evidence too thin, we still left.
We traveled nearly 13,000 km across America during the summer of 2013, through the pastures of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit, the swamps of New Orleans, where we found and worked with men and women who were creating small businesses whose purpose defined their goals.
Having been trained at the western edge of capitalism, this appeared to us as a revolutionary idea.
And this idea spread, developing into a non-profit organization, MBAs Across America, a movement that brought me here, on this stage, today.
This idea developed because we discovered that our generation is hungry for purpose, for meaning,
because we found countless entrepreneurs in every corner of America, creating jobs, changing lives, and in need of a little help.
But if I'm honest, it also developed because I fought for it.
I spared no effort in preaching this gospel, to bring more people to believe that we could heal the wounds of a broken country, one social enterprise at a time.
But it was this gospel journey that led me to this rather different gospel that I have come to share with you today.
This journey began one evening, nearly a year ago, at the Museum of Natural History in New York, during a gala for alumni of Harvard Business School.
Under a life-size replica of a whale, I sat with the titans of our time as they celebrated their peers and their good deeds.
There was pride in a room where the value and assets under management exceeded 500 billion dollars.
We examined everything we had done, and it was good.
But fate had it that, two days later, I had to go not very far from there, to Harlem. I found myself sitting in an urban farm that had once been a vacant lot, listening to a man named Tony talk to me about the children who came here every day.
They all lived below the poverty line.
Many of them carried their belongings in a backpack to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter.
Some of them were participating in Tony's program, called Harlem Grown, in order to receive their only meal of the day.
Tony told me that he had launched Harlem Grown with his retirement money, after 20 years as a taxi driver.
He told me that he didn't pay himself, because, despite its success, the program struggled to obtain resources.
He told me that he would accept any help he could receive.
And I was there to help.
When I left Tony, I felt the burning and salt of tears welling up in my eyes.
I felt the weight of the revelation that I could sit in a room one evening, where a few hundred people had 500 billion dollars, and in another room, two days later, just 5 kilometers away, where a man lived without a salary so that a child could have their only meal of the day.
It wasn't the glaring inequality that made me want to cry. It wasn't the thought of those hungry, homeless children, it wasn't the anger towards the 1% or the pity towards the 99%.
No, I was disturbed because I had finally realized that I was the dialysis of a country in need of a kidney transplant.
I realized that my story replaced all those of those expected to take charge, even if they had nothing to grasp onto to take charge; that my organization replaced all the structural, systemic aid that never made it to Harlem, or the Appalachians, or the -9th floor; that my voice replaced all those voices that seemed too ignorant, too proletarian, too ill-suited.
And this shame, this shame overwhelmed me, like the shame of sitting in front of the television watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium, again, and again, and again.
I had been deceived, tricked, swindled.
But this time, the false Savior was me.
You see, I have come a long way since the altar, the night when I believed the world was going to end, from a world where people spoke in tongues, considered suffering as a necessary act of God, and took a text as an infallible truth.
Yes, I have come so far that I find myself exactly where I started.
Because it is simply false to say that we live in an age of disbelief - no, we believe just as much today as before.
Some of us may believe in the prophecy of Brené Brown or Tony Robbins.
We can believe in the bible of the New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review.
We can deeply believe when we worship here, at the church of TED, but we desperately want to believe, we need to believe.
We speak the language of charismatic leaders who promise to solve all our problems.
We see suffering as a necessary act of capitalism, our god. We take the text of technological progress as infallible truth.
And we barely realize the human cost we pay when we fail to question a single brick, fearing it may destroy all our foundations.
But if you are disturbed by the unacceptable things we have come to accept, then it must be time for a reassessment.
I do not have a gospel of disruption or innovation, or a triple bottom line of results.
In fact, I do not have a gospel of faith to share with you today.
I have, and offer, a gospel of doubt.
The gospel of doubt does not require you to stop believing, but to believe in something new: that it is possible to not believe.
It is possible that the answers are wrong, that the questions themselves are wrong.
Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we, on this stage, in this room, may be wrong.
Because it raises the question: "Why?"
With all the power we hold in our hands, why do people still suffer so much?
This doubt leads me to share that we are putting my organization, MBAs Across America, into liquidation.
We have dismissed our team and closed our doors, and we will freely share our model with anyone who understands the power of doing this work without waiting for our permission.
This doubt forces me to give up the role of savior that some expect from me, because there is not enough time and our chances are too slim to wait for second comings, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here.
And this doubt, it rejuvenates me, it gives me hope, that when our problems overwhelm us, when the paths designed for us seem to lead us to our downfall, when our healers bring no relief to our wounds, it will not be our blind faith - no, it will be our humble doubt that will illuminate a little the darkness of our lives and our world, and allow us to make our voices heard to whisper,
or to scream, or simply to say, very simply: "There must be another way."
Thank you.
