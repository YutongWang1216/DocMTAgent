When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the heart of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
The new government emerged from a long war of independence and immediately announced a socialist program: health services, primary education became essentially free.
A significant expansion of rural health centers has placed around 80% of the population within a two-hour walk of one of these centers, a truly remarkable achievement.
In 1980, the year of independence, 25% of children in Zimbabwe were fully immunized.
In 1990, a decade later, this proportion was 80%.
I felt extremely privileged to be part of this transformation, a revolution.
The excitement, the camaraderie were palpable.
Working with brilliant Zimbabweans - scientists, doctors, activists - I felt connected not only to an African independence movement, but to a global progressive movement for public health.
But there were significant challenges.
Zimbabwe reported its first case of AIDS in 1985, the year of my arrival.
I had taken care of some AIDS patients in the early 80s, during my medical training at Harlem Hospital, but - we had no idea what awaited Africa.
In my early days there, the infection rate was 2%.
It would soar and reach one in four adults by the time of my departure from Harare, 17 years later.
In the mid-90s, I had to inform hundreds of middle-aged people that they were HIV positive.
I had seen friends and colleagues, my students, and patients at the hospital die.
In response to this, my colleagues and I set up a clinic.
We were demonstrating the use of condoms.
We launched education at school, interventions in the workplace.
We were conducting research. We were giving advice to the partners of infected men so that they knew how to protect themselves.
We worked hard, and at the time, I thought I was doing my best.
I provided excellent treatment, as good as possible.
But I was not talking about structural change.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan honestly spoke about his personal failure that led to the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was the director of the Department of Peace at the UN.
At a memorial service 10 years later, he said, "At the time, I believed I was doing my best, but I realized after the genocide that I could and should have done more to sound the alarm and gather support."
The AIDS epidemic caught the healthcare community by surprise, and today, when the World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people have died from this disease, I am not alone in feeling remorse and regret for not having done more, sooner.
But when I was living in Zimbabwe, I did not see my role as that of an advocate or a politician.
I was there because of my technical skills, clinical expertise, and epidemiological research.
For me, my work was to take care of patients and conduct research to better understand transmission patterns within the population, and I hoped that we would slow down the spread of the virus.
I was aware that marginalized populations had a very high risk of contracting and dying from AIDS.
And in the sugar plantations, which, up close, resembled more feudal fiefs than any modern enterprise, 60% of pregnant women were infected with HIV.
I worked to show that being infected was not a moral failure but rather linked to a culture of male superiority, forced labor of immigrants, and colonialism.
The white population was largely spared.
As healthcare professionals, our tools were pitifully weak: begging people to change their individual behavior, to use condoms, to reduce the number of partners.
Infection rates were rising. And when a treatment became available in the West, a treatment that remained our most powerful weapon against the virus, it was not affordable for the African public sector.
I did not denounce the unequal access to these life-saving medications or the underlying economic and political systems that were driving infection rates up in large segments of the population.
I rationalized my silence by telling myself that I was just a visitor in this country, that sounding the alarm could get me expelled, prevent me from doing my work, taking care of my patients, and conducting much-needed research.
So I did not revolt against the government's initial stance on AIDS.
I did not voice my concerns out loud.
Many doctors and healthcare professionals may think that I have done nothing wrong.
Our pact with our patients, the Hippocratic Oath and its variations, evokes the inviolability of the patient-doctor relationship.
I did everything I could for each of the patients I had.
But I knew that epidemics emerge along the cracks of our society, reflecting not only our biology, but more notably the patterns of marginalization, exclusion, and discrimination related to race, gender, sexuality, class, etc.
This was true for AIDS.
This was recently true for Ebola.
Medical anthropologists like Paul Farmer, who worked on AIDS in Haiti, have called this "structural violence." Structural because inequalities are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world, and are often invisible to privileged and powerful individuals; and violence because its impact - premature deaths, suffering, illness - is violent.
We do little for our patients if we do not recognize these social injustices.
Raising the alarm is the first step towards good public health practice, and this is how we could gather support to revolutionize and create change together.
Today, I do not remain silent.
I talk about a lot of things, even if they make those who listen uncomfortable, even if they make me uncomfortable.
Much of what I say is related to racial differences and institutionalized racism, things that are not supposed to exist in this country anymore, let alone in medical practice or public health.
But they exist, and we pay for them by shortening lives.
This is why raising the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the United States, the current institutional and interpersonal violence faced by people of color, mixed with our sad legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow, and 60 years of imperfect equality, raising the alarm about this is fundamental to the successful completion of my work as Commissioner of Health for the city of New York.
In New York, premature mortality - meaning dying before reaching 65 years old - is 50% higher for black men than for whites.
In 2012, a black woman had 10 times more risk than a white woman of dying during childbirth.
Although we have made significant progress in reducing infant mortality rates, a black baby still has nearly three times the risk of dying during their first year compared to a white baby.
New York is not an exception.
These statistics are compared with statistics made across the United States.
A recent analysis by the New York Times reported that there were, in the country,
1.5 million black men missing. They mentioned that more than one in six black men who are now between 25 and 54 years old are no longer leading a normal life, but are either in prison or have died prematurely.
There is a great injustice in the face of the daily and disproportionate violence towards young black men, which recent #BlackLivesMatter protests are drawing attention to.
But we must remember that disparate rates that persist and the occurrence and outcome of common diseases - heart diseases, cancers, diabetes, HIV - diseases that can kill slowly and silently and still claim even more black lives prematurely.
When the #BlackLivesMatter movement took shape, I was frustrated and angry that the medical community was reluctant to use the word "racism" in our research and work.
You must have felt something every time I said it.
Our students took part in white coat protests, but the medical community mostly stayed on the sidelines as current discrimination continues to impact disease patterns and mortality.
And I am afraid that the trend towards personalized and precise medicine, the search for biological or genetic targets for more tailored treatment, could inadvertently make us lose sight of the overall situation, that is to say the daily context in which a person lives, grows, works, loves, a fundamental factor in determining the population's health: for too many of us, poor health.
As healthcare professionals, in our daily work, whether in practice or in research, we witness a great injustice: the homeless who are unable to follow medical advice because they have other priorities; transgender youth who contemplate suicide because our society is too rigid; the single mother who is made to feel responsible for her child's poor health.
Our role as healthcare professionals is not only to treat our patients but also to raise the alarm and promote change.
Whether it is rightful or not, our position in society makes us very credible and we should not waste that.
I regret not speaking out in Zimbabwe, and I have promised myself that as Commissioner of Health for the city of New York, I will use every opportunity I have to raise the alarm and garner support for health equity.
I will denounce racism, and I hope that you will join me, and I will join you in denouncing sexism or any other form of inequality.
It is time for us to stand up and, as a community, denounce structural inequalities.
We do not need to have all the answers to call for change.
We only need courage.
The health of our patients, of each and every one of us, depends on it.
