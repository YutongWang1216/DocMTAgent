I come from one of the most liberal, tolerant, progressive places in the United States: Seattle, in the state of Washington.
I grew up with a family of great Seattleites.
My mother was an artist, my father a university professor, and I am grateful for my childhood, as I have always been completely comfortable living my life as I saw fit.
In fact, I took a path that was not the one my parents had imagined.
At 19, I dropped out of university - dropped out, fired, splitting hairs.
I went on tour as a professional French horn player, which was my lifelong dream.
I played chamber music across the United States and Europe, I toured for 2 years with a great jazz player: Charlie Bird.
Approaching my 30s, I ended up as a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra.
What a life!
My parents never complained.
They supported me all along.
It was not their dream.
They told their neighbors and friends, "Our son is taking a sabbatical decade."
And - There was, however, an embarrassing conversation about my lifestyle that I would like to tell you about.
I was 27 years old, I had returned from Barcelona, I was at my parents' house for Christmas, I was preparing dinner with my mother and we were alone in the kitchen.
And she was silent, too silent.
Something was wrong.
I said, "Mom, what are you thinking?"
She said, "Your father and I are worried about you."
I said, "What?" What could it be?
And she said, "I want you to be completely honest: did you vote Republican?"
In fact, I wasn't very political, I was just a French horn player.
I had an epiphany, they had perceived it and it was causing confusion.
I had become an enthusiast of capitalism and I want to explain to you what it is.
This stemmed from the interest I have always had in, believe it or not, poverty.
When I was a child, growing up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw real poverty.
We were a lower middle-class family, but of course, it's not real poverty.
It's even far from it.
The first time I saw poverty and its face, I was 6 or 7 years old, in the early 70s.
And, as for many of you, it was a prosaic and banal example.
It was a photograph in National Geographic of a child my age in East Africa, with flies on his face and a distended belly.
He wasn't going to make it, I knew it and I was powerless.
Some of you remember this image, not exactly this one, but a similar one.
She revealed the black misery to the West.
This vision haunted me as I grew up, went to school, dropped out, did something else, and started a family.
And I wondered what had happened to that child.
or to others like him around the world.
I studied, even though I wasn't at university, I was looking for an answer: what was happening to the poorest people in the world?
Was it getting worse, was it improving? What?
I found the answer and it changed my life, and I want to share it with you.
See - most Americans believe that poverty has worsened since our childhood since they saw this photo.
Ask Americans how poverty in the world has evolved, 70% will say that world hunger has worsened since the early 1970s.
But here is the truth.
Here is the epiphany that changed my way of thinking.
Between the 1970s and today, the percentage of the world's population living in famine, living on less than one dollar a day, adjusted for inflation, this percentage has decreased by 80%.
There has been an 80% decrease in the most severe global poverty since my childhood.
And I didn't even know it.
This, my friends, is a miracle.
We must celebrate it.
This is the greatest anti-poverty achievement in the history of humanity, and it is happening in our lifetime.
When I learned this, I asked: what made this happen, made this possible?
Because if you don't know why, you can't do it again.
If you want to do it again and lift the next two billion out of poverty, because that's what we're talking about: since my childhood, two billion of them, our brothers and sisters, have been lifted out of poverty.
I want the next two billion, so I must know why.
I was looking for an answer.
It wasn't political, because I didn't care.
I still don't care.
I wanted the best answer from traditional left, right, and center economists.
Here it is.
Here are the reasons.
These are the five reasons why two billion of our brothers and sisters have been lifted out of poverty since my childhood.
The first one: globalization.
The second one: free trade.
The third one: property rights.
The fourth one: the rule of law.
The fifth one: entrepreneurship.
It is the system of free enterprise spreading around the world after 1970 that has done this.
I am not naive.
I know that free enterprise is not perfect and that free enterprise alone is not enough to build a better world.
But she is brilliant.
And it transcends politics.
Here is what I learned, my epiphany.
Capitalism is not just about accumulation.
His main asset is aspiration, which is what many people talk about on this stage, the aspiration that comes from dreams embedded in the free enterprise system.
We must share it with more people.
I want to talk to you about a second epiphany that is linked to the first and that can bring us progress, not only in the world but also within ourselves.
The best quote I have heard to summarize the thoughts I have just mentioned about lifting people out of poverty is this: "Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history.
They have lifted billions of people out of poverty."
Who said that?
It sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
It's false.
President Barack Obama said it.
Why do I know it by heart?
Because he was talking to me.
That's crazy.
And I said, "Hallelujah!"
But more than that, I said, "What an opportunity."
Do you know what I was thinking about?
I was at an event organized on this subject at Georgetown University in May 2015.
And I thought that this was the solution to America's biggest problem today. What is it?
It is about coming together around these ideas, liberal and conservative, to help those who need it most.
No need to tell you that we are in crisis, in America and in many politically polarized countries around the world.
It has reached a critical level of crisis.
It's unpleasant. It's not fair.
Last year, there was an article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the West.
It was an article from 2014 on the asymmetry of political motivations.
What is this? Psychologists call this the phenomenon of presuming that your ideology is based on love, while assuming that your opponent's ideology is based on hate.
It is common in a global conflict.
You would expect, for example, to see it between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the authors of this article discovered is that today in America, a majority of Republicans and Democrats suffer from asymmetry of political motivations.
Today, a majority of politically active individuals believe they are motivated by love, while they think the other party is motivated by hate.
Think about it. Think about it.
Most people say, "My ideology is based on fundamental benevolence, I want to help people, but others are demonic and wish me harm."
Society cannot progress when there is this type of asymmetry.
It's impossible.
How to solve this?
First, let's be honest: there are differences.
Let's not downplay the differences. That would be naive.
There is a lot of research on this topic.
A veteran of the TED scene is my friend Jonathan Haidt.
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
He works on the ideology, values, and morals of different people to see their differences.
For example, he showed us that conservatives and liberals have a different emphasis on what they consider important.
For example, Jon Haidt showed that liberals care 59% more about poverty than economic freedom.
And conservatives care 28% more about economic freedom than poverty.
Irreconcilable differences?
We will never come together. False.
It is in diversity that our strength lies.
Remember what brought us out of poverty.
It was an obsession with poverty accompanied by the spread of a method of economic freedom throughout the world.
We need others, in other words, if we want to help people and lift the next two billion out of poverty.
There is no other solution.
How are we going to do it?
It's delicate.
We must innovate in our way of thinking.
Many points are on stage.
Social entrepreneurship. Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal.
We need to invest abroad in a sustainable, responsible, ethical, and moral way. Yes. Yes.
But what do we really need?
From a flexible ideology,
less predictable.
Right?
Don't you ever feel like your ideology is becoming predictable?
Almost conventional?
Don't you feel like you're always listening to people who agree with you?
Why is it dangerous?
Because when we talk about the economy in this country, on the right, conservatives, you always talk about taxes, regulations, a big government.
And on the left, liberals, you always talk about income inequality.
These are important things, very important to me and to you.
But when it comes to helping people who are dying of hunger and need us, these are distractions.
We must come together around the best ways to alleviate poverty using the best tools at our disposal, which only comes when conservatives acknowledge the need for liberals and their obsession with poverty, and liberals for conservatives and their obsession with the free market.
It is in this diversity that the future strength of this country lies, if we choose it.
How are we going to do it? How are we going to do it together?
I need an action plan, not just for you but for me.
Number one. First point: it is not enough to tolerate people who do not agree.
It's not enough.
Let us remember that we need people who do not agree, because there are people who need all of us, who are still waiting for these tools.
What will you do? How will you express it?
Where does it start? It starts here.
In this room, we are all lucky.
Lucky to have people who listen to us.
Lucky to thrive. Lucky to lead.
When people hear us, with unpredictable ideology, they might listen to us.
Progress might start there.
This is the first point. The second.
Secondly: I ask of you and myself to be specifically the person who blurs the boundary, who is ambiguous, difficult to classify.
If you are conservative, be a conservative who always talks about poverty and the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor.
If you are liberal, be a liberal who always talks about the beauty of free markets, used responsibly, to solve our problems.
If we do this, we get two things.
One: we start working for the next billions and being the solution that we have seen in the past and that we need in the future. We achieve this.
And the second thing is that we might be able to turn the dreadful sacred ideological war we are suffering from in this country into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
And then perhaps, just perhaps, we will realize that our significant differences are ultimately not so great.
Thank you.
