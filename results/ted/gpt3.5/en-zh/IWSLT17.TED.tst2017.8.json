However, challenges arose with the emergence of AIDS, prompting the author to set up a clinic, conduct condom demonstrations, and provide education and counseling to prevent the spread of HIV. The author also expresses regret for not advocating for structural change and addressing unequal access to life-saving drugs during the epidemic, focusing more on individual care rather than systemic issues. The overall tone is reflective, highlighting both the achievements and missed opportunities in the public health sector during this period.",

However, the author regrets not advocating for structural change and addressing unequal access to life-saving drugs during the epidemic. The paragraph also emphasizes the importance of recognizing social injustices in the medical field, particularly in relation to racial disparities and institutionalized racism, citing examples such as AIDS and Ebola. The urgent and critical tone stresses the need to speak up about these issues and create real change to address the disproportionate impact of racism on health outcomes in New York City and across the United States.",
