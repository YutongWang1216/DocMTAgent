Initially planning to work on it gradually over the year, they ended up rushing to complete it in just 72 hours before the deadline. Despite thinking it was terrible, the school praised it as the best they had ever seen. This experience led the author, Tim Urban, now a writer-blogger, to explore procrastination further. He conducted an MRI study to compare his brain with that of a non-procrastinator, believing that the brains of procrastinators are different. The overall tone is reflective, humorous, and self-deprecating, focusing on personal experiences and thoughts on procrastination.",

        "new_src_summary": "Tim Urban, a former government major in college, reflects on procrastinating on writing a 90-page senior thesis, which he completed in 72 hours before the deadline. Despite thinking it was terrible, the school praised it as the best they had ever seen. This experience led him to explore procrastination further, conducting an MRI study to compare his brain with that of a non-procrastinator. He discovered the presence of an Instant Gratification Monkey in the procrastinator's brain, disrupting the Rational Decision-Maker's plans by prioritizing instant gratification over productivity. The overall tone is reflective, humorous, and informative, focusing on personal experiences and the negative impact of the Instant Gratification Monkey on procrastination.",
        "new_tgt_summary": "在大学时，作者主修政府学，必须写很多论文。对于一份90页的毕业论文，作者计划了一年的时间表，从轻松开始，逐渐加速，最终像小楼梯一样完成。然而，在中间几个月出现了问题，导致计划无法按时完成。最终，作者制定了一个新的修订计划。在毕业论文截止日期前夕，作者匆忙完成论文，但后来发现论文质量糟糕。作者解释了自己长期拖延的原因，并提出了一个假设：拖延者的大脑与其他人不同。为验证这一假设，作者进行了自身大脑扫描并与不拖延者进行了比较。文中介绍了一个不拖延者的大脑和一个拖延者的大脑的差异。作者带来两个大脑的例子，一个是理性决策者，另一个是即时满足的猴子。拖延者的大脑由猴子控制，容易被即时满足的欲望引导，导致无法有效完成工作。文章指出，拖延者的大脑注重当下的轻松和有趣，而不拖延者的大脑更注重理性决策和完成有意义的事情。最终，作者成为了一名博客作者，专注于探讨拖延行为的心理过程。",

This experience led him to explore procrastination further, discovering the presence of an Instant Gratification Monkey in the procrastinator's brain. The conflict between the Monkey and the Rational Decision-Maker often leads to procrastination, where individuals prioritize instant gratification over productivity, spending time in the \"Dark Playground\" engaging in leisure activities. The overall tone is reflective, humorous, and informative, focusing on personal experiences and the inner workings of the human mind in decision-making processes.",

        "new_src_summary": "Tim Urban, a former government major, reflects on his experience of procrastinating on writing a 90-page senior thesis, which he completed in 72 hours before the deadline and was praised as the best by the school. This led him to explore procrastination further, discovering the presence of an Instant Gratification Monkey in the procrastinator's brain. The conflict between the Monkey and the Rational Decision-Maker often leads to procrastination, where individuals prioritize instant gratification over productivity, spending time in the \"Dark Playground\" engaging in leisure activities. The procrastinator eventually moves from the \"Dark Playground\" to the \"blue zone\" where important tasks are completed, aided by the Panic Monster, who emerges when deadlines or consequences become imminent. The author shares their experience of being invited to do a TED Talk and how the Panic Monster ultimately motivates them to start working on their talk. The overall tone is reflective, humorous, and informative, focusing on personal experiences and the inner workings of the human mind in decision-making processes, as well as the internal struggle between procrastination and productivity.",
        "new_tgt_summary": "在大学时，作者主修政府学，必须写很多论文。对于一份90页的毕业论文，作者计划了一年的时间表，从轻松开始，逐渐加速，最终像小楼梯一样完成。然而，在中间几个月出现了问题，导致计划无法按时完成。最终，作者制定了一个新的修订计划。在毕业论文截止日期前夕，作者匆忙完成论文，但后来发现论文质量糟糕。作者解释了自己长期拖延的原因，并提出了一个假设：拖延者的大脑与其他人不同。为验证这一假设，作者进行了自身大脑扫描并与不拖延者进行了比较。在黑暗游乐场中，拖延者常常体验到内疚、恐惧等负面情绪，而一个名为“惊慌怪兽”的存在会在关键时刻唤醒他们。在一次TED演讲的准备过程中，拖延者的“猴子”和“理性决策者”之间的冲突导致了一系列混乱，最终理性决策者接管控制权，拖延者开始准备演讲。文章指出，拖延者的大脑由猴子控制，容易被即时满足的欲望引导，导致无法有效完成工作。拖延者往往会陷入黑暗游乐场，花费过多时间在不该发生休闲活动的地方。最终，作者成为了一名博客作者，专注于探讨拖延行为的心理过程。",

He delves into the concept of procrastination, attributing it to the conflict between the Instant Gratification Monkey and the Rational Decision-Maker in the brain. The procrastinator often spends time in the \"Dark Playground\" prioritizing instant gratification over productivity until the Panic Monster emerges, pushing them into the \"blue zone\" to complete important tasks. Reflecting on his TED Talk experience, the author discusses how the Panic Monster ultimately motivates action. The paragraph explores the struggle of procrastination, emphasizing the role of the Panic Monster in driving individuals to complete tasks under looming deadlines and the negative impacts of procrastination in various aspects of life. The overall tone is reflective, humorous, and analytical, focusing on personal experiences and the internal battle between procrastination and productivity.",
        "new_tgt_summary": "在大学时，作者主修政府学，必须写很多论文。对于一份90页的毕业论文，作者计划了一年的时间表，从轻松开始，逐渐加速，最终像小楼梯一样完成。然而，在中间几个月出现了问题，导致计划无法按时完成。最终，作者制定了一个新的修订计划。在毕业论文截止日期前夕，作者匆忙完成论文，但后来发现论文质量糟糕。作者解释了自己长期拖延的原因，并提出了一个假设：拖延者的大脑与其他人不同。为验证这一假设，作者进行了自身大脑扫描并与不拖延者进行了比较。在黑暗游乐场中，拖延者常常体验到内疚、恐惧等负面情绪，而一个名为“惊慌怪兽”的存在会在关键时刻唤醒他们。在一次TED演讲的准备过程中，拖延者的“猴子”和“理性决策者”之间的冲突导致了一系列混乱，最终理性决策者接管控制权，拖延者开始准备演讲。文章指出，拖延者的大脑由猴子控制，容易被即时满足的欲望引导，导致无法有效完成工作。拖延者往往会陷入黑暗游乐场，花费过多时间在不该发生休闲活动的地方。最终，作者成为了一名博客作者，专注于探讨拖延行为的心理过程。另一方面，这段文段讨论了拖延者行为的系统和影响。作者通过自己的经历和接收到的来自各行各业的电子邮件，指出拖延者的两种类型：有截止日期和无截止日期的拖延。有截止日期时，惊慌怪兽会介入，限制拖延的影响；而无截止日期时，拖延的影响则无法控制。作者呼吁在面对无截止日期的任务时，需要自发性地努力工作，以避免拖延的延续影响。",

        "new_src_summary": "Tim Urban, a former government major, shares his experience of procrastinating on writing a 90-page senior thesis, completing it in 72 hours before the deadline and being praised for it. He delves into the concept of procrastination, attributing it to the conflict between the Instant Gratification Monkey and the Rational Decision-Maker in the brain. The paragraph explores the struggle of procrastination, emphasizing the role of the Panic Monster in driving individuals to complete tasks under looming deadlines and the negative impacts of procrastination in various aspects of life. It also discusses long-term procrastination, which can lead to unhappiness and regrets, making individuals feel like spectators in their own lives. The author argues that everyone is a procrastinator to some extent and encourages readers to reflect on what they are procrastinating on and to be aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey. The overall tone is reflective, introspective, and analytical, focusing on personal experiences and the internal battle between procrastination and productivity, with a call to action to start addressing procrastination today.",
        "new_tgt_summary": "在大学时，作者主修政府学，必须写很多论文。对于一份90页的毕业论文，作者计划了一年的时间表，从轻松开始，逐渐加速，最终像小楼梯一样完成。然而，在中间几个月出现了问题，导致计划无法按时完成。最终，作者制定了一个新的修订计划。在毕业论文截止日期前夕，作者匆忙完成论文，但后来发现论文质量糟糕。作者解释了自己长期拖延的原因，并提出了一个假设：拖延者的大脑与其他人不同。为验证这一假设，作者进行了自身大脑扫描并与不拖延者进行了比较。在黑暗游乐场中，拖延者常常体验到内疚、恐惧等负面情绪，而一个名为“惊慌怪兽”的存在会在关键时刻唤醒他们。在一次TED演讲的准备过程中，拖延者的“猴子”和“理性决策者”之间的冲突导致了一系列混乱，最终理性决策者接管控制权，拖延者开始准备演讲。文章指出，拖延者的大脑由猴子控制，容易被即时满足的欲望引导，导致无法有效完成工作。拖延者往往会陷入黑暗游乐场，花费过多时间在不该发生休闲活动的地方。最终，作者成为了一名博客作者，专注于探讨拖延行为的心理过程。另一方面，这段文段讨论了拖延者行为的系统和影响。作者通过自己的经历和接收到的来自各行各业的电子邮件，指出拖延者的两种类型：有截止日期和无截止日期的拖延。有截止日期时，惊慌怪兽会介入，限制拖延的影响；而无截止日期时，拖延的影响则无法控制。长期的拖延行为往往比短期截止日期的拖延更隐蔽，可能是导致不快乐和后悔的重要源泉。作者认为所有人都是拖延者，需要审视人生日历，保持警惕不让拖延占据上风。这是一个需要从今天开始的任务。",
