I would like to ask for a show of hands, has anyone unfriended someone on Facebook because they made some unpleasant remarks about politics, religion, parenting, or food?
Is there at least one person who is avoiding talking and avoiding someone?
In the past, it was enough to talk about the weather and health following Professor Higgins' words from "My Fair Lady" in order to have a polite conversation.
Recently, with issues such as climate change and anti-vaccination movements, it has become - no longer a safe topic to discuss.
In the world we live in, any conversation runs the risk of turning into a dispute, and politicians cannot talk to each other, even fiercely debating the most trivial issues. It's not normal.
A study conducted by the Pew Research Center on 10,000 American adults revealed that currently, people are more polarized and in conflict than ever before in history.
Everyone refuses to compromise and does not listen.
And we make decisions based on what we already believe about where we live, who we marry, and who we become friends with.
This also means refusing to listen.
In conversations, a balance between speaking and listening is necessary, but we have lost that balance somewhere.
The development of technology is also one factor.
You probably have a cell phone in your hand or within reach right now.
According to the Pew Research Center, one-third of teenagers send over 100 messages a day.
Most of those people probably communicate more through messaging than face-to-face conversations.
In the magazine "The Atlantic"
There is an interesting article written by high school teacher Paul Barnwell.
He assigned a communication task to the students.
I wanted to teach a method of speaking about specific topics without using notes.
He writes, "I noticed—"
"The ability to have conversations is the most overlooked skill that teachers are failing to teach."
Students spend hours every day interacting with ideas and other people through screens, but they have little opportunity to hone their interpersonal skills.
It may sound strange, but we must ask ourselves: Is there something more important than the ability to have conversations confidently and coherently in the 21st century among all skills?
I make a living by speaking: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, national leaders, plumbers.
I talk to both people I like and people I don't like.
Personally, I also talk to people with whom I completely disagree.
Still, I can have wonderful conversations with those people.
In the next 10 minutes, I will teach you how to speak and listen.
You may have heard various tips about the secret of conversations, such as looking into the other person's eyes, thinking about topics of interest in advance, showing that you are actively listening by making eye contact, nodding, and smiling, or repeating and summarizing the other person's words.
Forget all of that.
It's not helpful.
You don't need to learn how to appear as if you are listening attentively. If you are actually listening attentively, then that's what matters.
(Applause) I use the skills of a professional interviewer in my everyday life as well.
I will teach you interview techniques, but they will also be useful for improving your conversational skills. Please learn how to have conversations that do not waste each other's time, are not boring, and do not hurt the other person.
Everyone has had wonderful conversations before.
Do you know what it is like?
It is a conversation where you feel drawn in, inspired, and able to establish a real connection with the other person, feeling completely understood by them at the end.
There is no reason why most conversations should not be like that.
Let's look at the 10 basic rules of conversation together. If you can master even one of them, you will be able to enjoy better conversations.
Rule 1: "Don't multitask."
Not only should you stop playing with your cell phone, tablet, or car keys, but also
It means being there both physically and mentally.
Be present in that moment.
Don't think about arguing with your boss.
Don't think about what to have for dinner.
If you want to opt out of the conversation, please feel free to do so. However, please refrain from only participating halfway.
Rule 2: "Don't speak unilaterally."
If you want to express your opinion without the opportunity for reactions, discussions, counterarguments, or growth, you should write a blog.
The reason why I don't invite people who speak unilaterally to my show is because it's boring.
If you are a conservative, you dislike Obama, food stamps, and abortion.
If you are a liberal, you probably dislike big banks, oil companies, and Dick Cheney.
It is understood what you are saying.
It's not impossible to become like that.
You need to approach conversations with the attitude that there is something to learn.
The famous therapist M. Scott Peck says, "To truly listen, you need to put yourself aside."
This means that sometimes you need to set aside your own opinions.
"When the speaker feels accepted, they no longer feel defenseless and begin to show the listener deep into their heart."
Let's reiterate and approach with an attitude of learning.
According to Bill Nye, "Everyone you meet knows something you don't."
If it were up to me, I would say, "Everyone is an expert in something."
Point 3: Asking open-ended questions.
Let's learn from journalists.
Ask questions that start with when/where/who/what/why/how.
Even if you ask complex questions, you will only receive simple answers.
If you ask, "Were you scared?"
Respond to the most impressive words in the question, in this case "Were you scared," with a simple "yes" or "no."
"Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."
Let's have the other person explain, because they are the ones who know.
Ask a question like this: "What was the situation like?"
"How did you feel?"
If you do that, the other person will have to stop and think, and then you will receive a much more interesting answer.
Point 4: Going with the flow.
Ideas that come to mind must be let out.
You may have heard of interviews like this before, where after the guest talks for minutes, the host's questions are completely unrelated or repeating what has already been answered.
The host must have stopped asking what he heard two minutes ago, thinking of a clever question that he decided he absolutely had to say.
We are also doing exactly the same thing.
I remember encountering actor Hugh Jackman at a café while sitting and talking with someone.
And they stop listening.
Ideas and thoughts come to mind, but...
Just let them disappear as they come to mind.
Number 5: "If you don't know, just say you don't know."
People who appear on the radio, especially in the case of NPR, are aware that what they say will be recorded, so they are very careful when claiming to be an expert in something or knowing something for sure.
Please do the same, it's okay to be overly cautious.
Do not make the conversation cheap.
Number 6: "Do not identify the other person's experience as identical to your own."
It is important not to bring up your own experience of losing a family member when the other person is talking about losing their family member.
It is important not to start talking about how much you dislike your job when the other person is talking about troubles at work.
The experiences of the other person and oneself are completely different.
Every experience is unique.
What is even more important is not to be talking about oneself.
You do not need to try to show how great you are or how much you are struggling at that moment.
It is said that when asked about his IQ, Stephen Hawking responded, "Who knows, boasting about IQ is something losers do."
Conversation is not an opportunity for self-promotion [Conversations in the 21st century]
"How are you feeling today?" "Check out my blog!" Number 7: "Do not repeat the same thing over and over."
It's annoyingly patronizing, but everyone tends to do it.
Especially in conversations at the workplace or with children, people often try to demonstrate the correctness of their own arguments by changing their words and repeating them.
Please do not do that.
Number 8: "Do not sweat the small stuff."
To be frank, the other person is not concerned about the details such as eras, names, or dates. You may be struggling to remember them, but everyone is trying.
The other person is not interested. The interest lies in you.
What kind of person you are and what commonalities you have.
So, let's forget about the details. They are not necessary.
Number 9, this is not the end, but the most important thing.
"Listening"
There have been so many great figures who have mentioned this point, but listening is the most important skill that everyone can improve.
These are the words of Buddha, slightly rephrased: "You don't learn anything when your mouth is open."
As the famously taciturn President Calvin Coolidge once said, "No one ever lost their job by listening."
Why don't we try to listen to each other?
One reason is that I would rather talk than listen.
When speaking, you have the initiative.
There is no need to listen to things that you are not interested in.
Become the center of attention.
You can strengthen your identity.
However, there are other reasons as well, it is to avoid being distracted.
The average person speaks at a rate of 225 words per minute, but we can comprehend up to 500 words per minute.
Our consciousness tries to fill the remaining 275 words of capacity.
It certainly requires effort and energy to focus on the other person, but without that, it will not be considered a conversation.
The two people are just in the same place shouting unrelated words at each other.
We must listen to each other.
Author Stephen Covey expresses it beautifully.
Many people do not listen to understand, but rather
Listening with the intention to respond.
There is one more rule, which is Rule 10: "Be concise."
[According to my sister, "Good conversation is like a miniskirt - short enough to be interesting, but long enough to cover the essentials."] (Applause) Everything that has been mentioned so far can be summarized into one thing: "Having an interest in the other person."
I was raised in the home of my very famous grandfather, it was a usual thing in my family.
Various people came to talk to my grandparents, and after the guests left, my mother would come and ask, "Do you know who that person was?"
She became the runner-up Miss America.
That person is the Mayor of Sacramento.
She is a Pulitzer Prize winner, and he is a Russian ballet dancer.
So I believe that everyone has something amazing hidden within them.
I have come to believe that this is what makes me a good host.
I expect to be impressed by keeping my mouth shut as much as possible and opening my heart. So far, I have never been disappointed by that.
Please do the same thing.
Going out, talking to people, listening, and most importantly, expecting to be impressed.
Thank you for listening attentively.
