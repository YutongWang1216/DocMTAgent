Have you ever heard of such place names as Kenema in Sierra Leone and Arua in Nigeria?
That is the most unique place for me.
In that area, nurses, doctors, and scientists have been quietly battling one of the most terrifying enemies of humanity for many years - the Lassa virus.
The Lassa virus is closely similar to the Ebola virus.
It causes high fever and sometimes even takes lives.
But by risking their lives every day to protect the people of the community in that area, they are also protecting all of us.
But what surprised me the most when I visited there many years ago was that they start their extremely tough daily routine on the front lines every morning by singing.
Everyone gathers together to express joy.
They show vitality.
Throughout the years, visiting each other, gathering with everyone, singing, creating songs, it is truly enjoyable. We are not there just for the pursuit of science, but because we resonate with human love.
As the situation changes, I believe it becomes increasingly important and indispensable.
In March 2014, it changed significantly. It was when a major Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea.
This was the first outbreak in West Africa, near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
We are afraid-
In fact, for a while, it was believed that the spread of infection of Lassa and Ebola was greater than anticipated, and we thought that it might eventually reach Kenema.
So my team members immediately took action and joined Dr. Fumah Khan's team. There, we prepared a high-sensitivity virus RNA detection device, ready to detect Ebola once it crossed the border and reached Sierra Leone.
Since we had already been using such a device for Lassa virus countermeasures, we were familiar with the method, and our team was very capable.
All we had to do was provide them with the tools and location to test for Ebola.
However, unfortunately, that day has come.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to the hospital's maternity ward, and when the team conducted a virus RNA test, they confirmed the first case of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Sierra Leone.
Their work was extremely admirable.
They immediately diagnosed this case, safely treated the patient, and began contact tracing to understand the situation.
With this, the spread of infection might have been stopped early.
However, by that day, the outbreak had already been ongoing for several months.
Hundreds of cases occurred, surpassing the previous outbreaks.
When it reached Sierra Leone, it was no longer just another case, but came rushing in like a tsunami.
In order to confront this infectious disease, we collaborated with the international community, the Ministry of Health, and the authorities in Kenema. The following week, there were 31 cases, then 92, and then 147 cases - all patients flowed into Kenema. This is because there are limited facilities in Sierra Leone that can handle this disease.
We worked around the clock, doing everything possible to save patients, raise awareness, and also did one more simple thing.
Of course, it was a relief to dispose of the blood samples collected to detect Ebola from the patients.
Instead, we inactivated the virus with chemicals, packed the blood samples in a box, crossed the sea, and sent them to other research facilities.
My team sent it to Boston.
We continued to work day and night, working shifts every day, and quickly analyzed the genomes of 99 Ebola viruses.
The genome of the virus is its blueprint.
Genomes are something that everyone has.
It represents all the qualities that make up us and contains vast amounts of information.
The results of such work may be simple but very powerful.
By observing and comparing these 99 viruses with the three genomes previously announced in Guinea, we were able to clarify that the outbreak started in Guinea months ago. It first infected humans and then spread through human transmission.
This is very important to clarify how to intervene, but what is important after that is contact tracing investigation.
We have confirmed that the virus is mutating as it spreads among humans.
It is very important to observe each of these mutations, as diagnostic equipment, vaccines, treatments, and all such things are fundamentally based on genome sequences.
International health experts need to deploy measures in response to this and reassess all previous achievements.
At that time, as a scientist, my work involved accumulating data, spending months and months in the laboratory carefully analyzing the data, going through several exchanges to publish research papers, and finally releasing the data once the paper was published.
This is the current state of the flow of research by scientists.
But you couldn't have done such things, could you?
It was very clear that friends were on the front lines, and what was also very clear is that help was needed, and a lot of it.
Therefore, the first thing we did was to immediately publish the genome sequence on a website after it was read.
I simply sent out the data to the world as it was and said, "Please lend us your strength."
And help arrived.
I was amazed to see the data being published in no time, and we received messages from people all over the world.
One of the world's top virus tracking teams suddenly became our allies.
We started collaborating virtually, continuing communication through phone calls and emails, tracking the virus minute by minute, and devising ways to stop the spread of infection.
In times of crisis like that, there are various ways to create a community.
Especially when the outbreak began to spread on a global scale, everyone actively investigated, got involved, and tried to lend their support.
Everyone wished to get involved.
The abilities of such people around the world are truly amazing, and the internet connects all of us.
Imagine this, instead of seeing each other as threats and avoiding each other, everyone says, "Let's do this."
They say, "Let's work together to solve this."
The problem was that the data we all used was very limited and insufficient, as it was only what we found through internet searches.
At such times, a great deal of potential and opportunities are lost.
During the early stages of the infectious disease outbreak in Kenema, 106 medical records had been collected, and we decided to make them public worldwide.
And in our research institute, we were able to prove that by training a computer with those 106 cases, we could predict the prognosis of Ebola patients with almost 100% accuracy, which we then shared with the local healthcare workers.
We created an app for providing information, but in order for the app to be effective enough and to demonstrate that
106 cases were not nearly enough, so we were waiting for more data to come in before the release.
But the data did not come in easily.
Everyone was researching and thinking individually, waiting for more data to come in. However, everyone was isolated in their own silos and not utilizing the power of cooperation.
But, I mean, this kind of thing is just unbelievable, right?
Don't you think so? I'm sure everyone thinks the same, right?
Our lives are at stake.
In reality, many lives were lost, including five healthcare workers, my dear colleagues, Bal Foray, Alex Mogboi, Dr. Fumah Khan, Alice Koboma, and Mohamed Fuller.
They are among the five healthcare workers who died in Kenema and its surrounding areas. While the world was waiting, we were silently working separately at that time.
Ebola hemorrhagic fever, like any other threat to humanity, escalates due to suspicion, pulling in different directions, and discord.
When we create walls between us and fight, the virus gains strength.
But unlike other natural threats, the battle against Ebola involves all of us equally.
We are fighting together.
If one person contracts Ebola, it may quickly spread to someone else.
Now, in a situation where our lives are equally fragile, with the same vitality, fears, and hopes, I hope that we can cooperate with joy together.
One of the graduate students I mentored read a book about Sierra Leone and learned that the word "Kenema," which is the name of the city where our hospital is located, is actually a word in the Mende language of Sierra Leone, meaning "clear like a river, transparent to everyone's eyes."
I felt a very deep meaning in that. Even before knowing that, we have always respected the people of Kenema, shared information in an open environment, and strived to work together.
That is an important thing.
When an outbreak occurs, it is necessary to openly share information with both ourselves and everyone around us in order to fight it together.
This is not the first Ebola outbreak, nor will it be the last. There are still many other pathogens lurking, such as the Lassa virus.
And when the next infectious epidemic occurs, it may happen in a large metropolis where millions of people reside.
It might be a virus that spreads through the air.
There is a possibility that the virus may be intentionally released.
This is a very frightening thing, of course. However, at the same time, what this experience has taught us is that we have the technology and capability to overcome it. It means winning the battle against virus infections and gaining the upper hand.
But it becomes possible as long as we join forces, and let's do so with joy.
Dr. Khan, who lost his life in the battle against infectious diseases, and those who sacrificed their lives on the front lines, have always been fighting alongside us. Let us continue to fight this battle together with them.
Let's illuminate the world with the cooperation of billions of warm hearts and compassion, so that the world is not tossed around by the destruction caused by a single virus.
Thank you.
