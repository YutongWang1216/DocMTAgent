At times, as a European, I feel very ashamed.
In the past year, over one million people have sought help and arrived in Europe. Our response, to be honest, has been quite inadequate.
It's really full of contradictions.
Everyone mourned the tragic death of 2-year-old Alan Kurdi, but since then, over 200 children have continued to drown in the Mediterranean one after another.
While recognizing the responsibility sharing for refugee acceptance in international agreements, it is silently acknowledging the fact that the number of refugees accepted by the small country of Lebanon exceeds the total in Europe.
While we lament the existence of smuggling boats, we have turned them into the sole escape route to Europe.
Despite the shortage of labor, we are excluding people who economically and demographically match the needs of the workforce from being accepted.
While advocating for liberalism in opposition to Islamic fundamentalism, they are detaining young refugees with oppressive policies, separating children from their families, and confiscating belongings of refugees.
Don't you think this is strange?
Why have we come to adopt such inhumane responses to such a humanitarian crisis?
I don't believe it's because people are indifferent. At least, I don't want to believe that's the reason.
I believe it's because politicians lack vision. It is a vision to adapt the international refugee policies created over 50 years ago to the changing globalized era.
Therefore, I would like to go back to basics and pose two very fundamental questions that we all should consider.
First, why is the current system not functioning?
And how can we fix this?
The modern refugee system was created by these people immediately after World War II.
The original purpose is to provide people with a destination when a country collapses or, in the worst case, turns its blade towards its citizens, so that they can live safely and with dignity until they can return.
It was created in anticipation of situations like those seen in Syria today.
The international agreement signed between governments of 147 countries, such as the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, pledged to mutually accept refugees into their own territories. This is about accepting people fleeing from conflict and persecution.
However, today this system is not functioning.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum, but
In reality, our immigration policies are blocking the path to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek assimilation in a safe haven and to eventually return to their homeland.
In reality, it becomes a nearly perpetual state of deadlock.
In theory, refugees are supposed to be shared responsibility among countries around the world, but
In reality, countries adjacent to conflict zones, due to geographical issues, are overwhelmingly hosting the majority of refugees worldwide.
The system is not functioning because the rules are flawed, not because
We should reconsider that because the rules are not being properly applied to adapt to the changing world.
Here, what is the actual mechanism of the current refugee system?
Let me explain a little.
However, I will explain from the perspective of refugees, not from a top-down view of the system.
First, imagine a Syrian woman.
Let's call her Amira.
She is a woman who symbolizes many people in that region.
Amira is a woman with children, like 25% of the world's refugees. The reason she cannot return home is because the city she lived in is in such a state. As you can see, Amira's city, Homs, was once a beautiful and historic city, but now it is buried in rubble.
There is no situation where they can return.
However, Amira also does not have the option of resettling in a third country, as it is like winning the lottery, only available to 1% of refugees worldwide.
Therefore, Amira and her family are forced to make almost impossible choices.
There are only three basic options available.
The first option is to enter a refugee camp with your family.
While assistance may be received there, Amira and her family's future is practically non-existent.
Refugee camps are desolate and barren lands - many of them are located in the desert.
At night in Jordan's Zaatari refugee camp, the sound of gunshots from the border with Syria can be heard.
There are constraints on economic activities.
The quality of education is also not good.
And around 80% of refugees housed in camps around the world will endure such conditions for a minimum of five years.
Life there is miserable. Perhaps that is why only 9% of Syrians actually choose this path.
Next, there is also the option of heading to the city, such as Amman and Beirut in neighboring countries.
This is the option chosen by 75% of Syrian refugees.
However, they also face significant challenges there.
Refugees typically do not have the right to work in these urban areas.
Assistance is not received much either.
In this case, Amira and her family will face a life of poverty in the city with almost nothing left after using up their savings.
The third option - the number of Syrians choosing this is increasing.
It is a phenomenon seen in Europe today, where people risk their lives on a very dangerous journey in search of a glimmer of hope for their families and aim for other countries.
The world is presenting refugees with such impossible choices, limiting options to three: camp accommodation, a life of poverty in the city, and a dangerous journey.
For refugees, this is the essence of the international refugee system.
But thinking that this is the only option is a misconception.
I believe there is room for reevaluation.
The reason why these options are limited is because in our minds, we believe that refugees have no other choice but this, but that is a mistake.
Politicians view the refugee issue as a "zero-sum" problem - in other words, they believe that any action taken for refugees will burden the citizens.
As a common premise, we tend to think of refugees as burdensome or as a societal burden.
On the contrary, there are ways in which refugees can contribute to society.
What I want to say is that there are ways for everyone to benefit while expanding the choices available to refugees - the receiving country, the community, our society, and the refugees themselves.
I believe that the way we think about refugees can be fundamentally changed through the four methods I am about to discuss.
One common point among all four is the utilization of opportunities created by globalization, fluidity, and the market to change our perspective on the refugee issue.
The first idea is to create an environment for refugees. It starts from a very basic understanding that refugees are just like everyone else, but are simply placed in abnormal situations.
I started conducting research on refugee economic activities in Uganda with colleagues from Oxford University.
I did not choose Uganda because it is a leading host country in the world.
It is because they have adopted a very excellent policy.
Unlike other host countries around the world, Uganda provided economic opportunities for refugees.
They were given the right to work and freedom of movement to refugees.
This has resulted in remarkable achievements for both refugees and refugee settlement areas.
In the capital city of Kampala, 21% of refugees own businesses and employ workers, with 40% of those employed being nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees were creating employment and hiring nationals of the host country.
Even within refugee camps, we have seen remarkable examples of vibrant individual businesses.
For example, in a refugee settlement called Nakivale, Congolese refugees are involved in a business of buying and selling digital music.
A business launched by a Rwandan refugee involved providing computer games for young people using recycled game consoles and televisions.
Despite the harsh environment, innovative initiatives are being carried out. This photo is of a Congolese man named Demukei.
When he arrived at the settlement, he was almost illiterate, but he aspired to be a filmmaker.
He has established a community radio station with friends and colleagues, and now he is engaged in video production by borrowing a video camera.
We have successfully co-produced two documentary films with my team on a limited budget.
We should decide our response to refugees by referring to such examples.
Rather than viewing refugees as inevitably reliant on humanitarian aid, we need to provide opportunities for them to thrive as human beings.
Of course, clothing, bedding, a place to sleep, food, and other essentials are all important in emergency situations, but we need to look beyond that.
Opportunities such as communication, electricity, education, the right to work, and access to capital and banks.
We must provide the opportunity for refugees to benefit from the global economy, as it is something that should be common for all of us.
The second idea is related to economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all refugee-hosting countries around the world adopt policies like Uganda's.
Most countries do not welcome refugees as part of their economy in the way Uganda does.
However, there are viable practical solutions available.
Last April, I went to Jordan with my colleague, development economist Paul Collier. During our stay, we brainstormed, discussed with the international community and the Jordanian government, and explored ways aligned with Jordan's national development strategy.
We came up with a way to provide jobs for Syrians, exploring the possibility of creating employment for refugees in economic zones, along with the employment of Jordanian nationals in the host country.
Just 15 minutes away from the Zaatari refugee camp, where 83,000 refugees reside, there is an economic zone called the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area.
The Jordanian government has invested over one million dollars in connecting this area to the power supply network and road network, but there are two missing components: labor force and domestic investment.
What if refugees could work here? Not confined to camps, able to support their families, acquire skills through vocational training, and then return to Syria?
We believed this would be beneficial for Jordan because the development strategy of Jordan as a middle-income country requires the development of domestic manufacturing industries.
It is beneficial not only for refugees but also contributes to the reconstruction of Syria after the conflict. They will eventually become the best human resources to rebuild Syria - based on the recognition that the protection and training of refugees are necessary.
When this proposal was published in the political magazine "Foreign Affairs"
Caught the attention of King Abdullah
Two weeks ago, at a Syria support conference held in London, an announcement was made that a pilot project will be implemented this summer.
(Applause) The third idea I would like to propose is a matching system between countries and refugees, which leads to happy outcomes like in this photo. Here, Syrian refugees are taking a selfie with Chancellor Angela Merkel.
It's not often that we ask refugees about their hopes and where they want to go, but it is possible for everyone to benefit while listening to their voices.
The concept of matching theory developed by economist Alvin Roth is to determine the final combination based on the preferences of the parties involved.
Colleagues Will Jones and Alex Taitelboim have explored how to apply this concept to refugees, asking refugees to list their desired destinations in order of preference and, at the same time, asking host countries to prioritize refugees based on job skills, language, and other conditions of the desired refugee type, and then matching the two.
Now, of course, when considering the conditions of the acceptance framework, elements such as diversity and vulnerability should be taken into account, but this can also be considered as a method to increase the matching rate.
An example of the successful application of the concept of matching is seen in university admission quotas for students and kidney donors with patients, as well as algorithms used in dating websites.
How about incorporating this for expanding the options available to refugees?
It can also be used on a domestic scale. One of the major challenges we face is convincing local communities to accept refugees.
Currently, for example, in my country of the UK, there is often the absurd practice of sending engineers to rural areas and farmers to cities.
Therefore, by conducting market matching, it is possible to align the preferences of both parties and hear the needs and requests from both the residents of the host community and the refugees.
And the fourth idea is humanitarian visas.
Most of the tragedies and chaos happening in Europe are completely avoidable.
The fundamental contradiction in Europe's refugee regulations is causing this. What this means is that in order to seek asylum in Europe, one must arrive without prior preparation on the infamous dangerous journey. But why is such a journey necessary?
In this day and age when budget airlines and consular services are well-established, such journeys should not be necessary at all, yet last year, over 3,000 people died due to this. This occurred at the borders of Europe and within European countries.
Simply put, the solution to avoidable refugee tragedies in Europe lies in allowing refugees to travel to Europe normally and become asylum seekers. The method to achieve this is through something called humanitarian visas, which can be obtained at embassies or consulates in neighboring countries. Then, refugees can simply pay for their own travel expenses and travel to Europe by ferry or plane.
It costs 1,000 euros to cross from Turkey to the islands of Greece using smugglers.
A budget airline ticket from Bodrum to Frankfurt costs 200 euros.
There are significant benefits to opening up these options for refugees.
Many lives will be saved, and the refugee smuggling industry itself will be affected, leading to a decrease in chaos at the forefront of Europe, such as the islands of Greece.
What is obstructing such means is not rational measures, but policies.
This idea has actually been implemented.
Brazil took the lead in adopting this approach, with over 2,000 Syrians obtaining humanitarian visas to enter Brazil and gaining refugee status upon arrival.
All Syrians who have utilized this system have obtained refugee status and received official refugee recognition.
There are historical precedents as well.
Between 1922 and 1942, using Nansen passports as international identification documents, 450,000 Assyrians, Turks, and Chechens moved within Europe and applied for refugee status in other European countries.
The Nansen International Office for Refugees has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, recognizing the effectiveness of this pragmatic strategy.
All four ideas mentioned now are ways to increase the options for the hypothetical refugee Amira mentioned at the beginning.
This is a method to broaden the options available to refugees, eliminating the need to limit them to the three unrealistic choices mentioned earlier, while benefiting others as well.
In conclusion, we urgently need a new vision that understands refugees as not burdensome while expanding their options.
The notion that refugees are inevitably burdensome is incorrect.
While it is a humanitarian obligation, refugees are individuals with skills, talents, and motivation. Given the opportunity, they have the ability to contribute to society.
In the future, there will be no end to people migrating around the world.
What is happening in Europe will continue for many years to come.
Refugees continue to move and wander in search of a place to stay. To address this situation, we should explore methods that utilize opportunities created by globalization, market liquidity, and other factors, rather than relying on old theories of humanitarian aid or charitable thinking.
I want to appeal to everyone, including all politicians, to wake up and face this issue head-on.
Thank you.
