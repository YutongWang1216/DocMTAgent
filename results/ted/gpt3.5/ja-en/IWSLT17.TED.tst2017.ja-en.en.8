In 1985, when I moved to Harare, Zimbabwe, social justice was at the core of the country's healthcare policy.
After a long war of independence, a new regime emerged and immediately declared socialist policies, making healthcare services and primary education essentially free.
They significantly increased the number of local medical facilities, achieving the remarkable result that approximately 80% of the population can reach medical facilities within a two-hour walk.
In 1980, when Zimbabwe gained independence, the vaccination rate for children in the country was 25%.
By 1990, just 10 years later, it had reached 80%.
I was truly proud to be involved in this major reform.
The excitement and unity of the people were visible.
I felt like I was part of not only Africa's independence movement but also the cutting-edge public health movement around the world, standing shoulder to shoulder with highly capable local scientists, doctors, and activists.
However, there was a terrible problem.
In the year I arrived, 1985, Zimbabwe's first case of AIDS was reported.
In the early 1980s, while working as a resident at Harlem Hospital, I had seen several AIDS patients, but I had absolutely no idea what was looming over Africa.
In the early stages of my stay, the HIV infection rate was around 2%.
That had skyrocketed, with one in four adults being infected, which was the situation 17 years after I left Harare.
By the mid-1990s, I had disclosed to hundreds of people in their prime working years that they were HIV-positive.
I experienced the deaths of colleagues and friends, and also witnessed the deaths of students and patients.
In response to this, I established a clinic with my colleagues.
I demonstrated how to use a condom.
I started sex education in schools and workplaces.
I conducted case studies and provided prevention methods to partners of infected individuals.
I worked hard and at that time, I thought I was doing my best.
I thought I was providing excellent treatment, but looking back, it was quite inadequate.
However, I was not engaged in activities seeking structural reforms.
Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan candidly admitted that his own mistakes led Rwanda to genocide.
He stated that he was sent there. In the year when the genocide occurred in 1994, he was the UN Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations.
At the commemorative ceremony for the 10th anniversary of the genocide, looking back on that time, I realized, "I was convinced that I was doing my best at the time, but when the genocide occurred, I realized that there were more things I could have done and should have done. I realized that there were things I needed to do to sound the alarm and to garner cooperation."
The AIDS pandemic caught the medical community off guard, and according to the World Health Organization's estimates, it is said that 39 million people have died from AIDS to date. I am not the only one who regrets not acting sooner.
However, during my stay in Zimbabwe, I did not position myself to advocate for change or take a political stance.
I had come as a clinician and an epidemiological researcher to utilize my specialized skills.
In my heart, I believed that my role was to take care of patients, conduct research, and deepen understanding of the infection patterns among residents. I hoped that by doing so, I could stop the spread of this virus.
I was aware that the risk of AIDS onset and death is higher among socially vulnerable individuals.
In the sugar cane plantation, similar to a feudal estate from the medieval times rather than any modern corporate organization, 60% of pregnant women were HIV positive.
I explained that just because someone is infected, it does not mean they are promiscuous; rather, it is a product of a male-dominated culture, forced seasonal labor, and the legacy of colonialism.
The white population did not suffer much damage.
As healthcare professionals, we were painfully powerless, only able to plead for individuals to change their behavior, use condoms, and reduce the number of sexual partners.
The infection rate continued to rise. Although treatment drugs were developed in the West - which are still the most effective AIDS treatment today, they were out of reach for any public sector in Africa.
I remained silent, not speaking out against the unequal access to life-saving drugs, nor against the political and economic systems underlying the AIDS epidemic - systems that allowed such a large-scale infection to occur.
I justified my silence by telling myself, "I am not a resident of this country, and if I sound the alarm, I could be expelled from the country. I may lose my job, not be able to see patients, and be unable to conduct the necessary research that is needed."
So I remained silent, without expressing any opinions on the government's policy on AIDS at that time.
I did not fully assert my concerns.
Many doctors and healthcare workers probably think that I was not at fault.
It is a promise between doctors and patients - the Hippocratic Oath and its variations establish the sanctity of the relationship between physicians and patients.
I did everything I could, giving my best to each and every one of my patients.
However, I realized that such a major epidemic reflected the distortions in society. It was not just based on biological causes, but rather stemmed from the customs of excluding, ostracizing, and discriminating against the vulnerable. It was discrimination based on race, gender, sexuality, social class, and more.
AIDS fits into this category.
The recent Ebola outbreak was similar.
Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer, who have been involved in AIDS prevention activities in Haiti, refer to this as "structural violence." The reason for calling it "structural" is that inequality is embedded in the political and economic structures of our society, often invisible to those with privilege and power. Calling it "violence" signifies that the consequences of this phenomenon - premature death, suffering, and disease - are violent.
If you want to be of help to patients even a little, you must not overlook the recognition of such social inequalities.
Calling attention is the first step to making public health function, as it gathers collaborators, paves the way together, and brings about real change.
So, recently, I have not remained silent either.
I speak out on many things, even when it may make the listener uncomfortable or when I feel awkward speaking out myself.
In many cases, issues such as racial disparities and institutionalized racism, which should no longer exist in this country, are especially unacceptable in the healthcare field and public health - that is the point.
It is because of its existence that people are losing their lives without living out their full lifespan as a consequence.
Therefore, we must sound the alarm - the ongoing institutional and interpersonal violence in American healthcare, which is racial discrimination - the violence inflicted on people of color has left a painful legacy in America, exacerbated by 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow laws, and 60 years of incomplete equality. Sounding the alarm against such violence is at the core of my mission as the Commissioner of Health for New York City.
In New York City, the premature mortality rate for individuals under 65 is 50% higher for Black men compared to White men.
In 2012, the maternal mortality rate of Black women was more than 10 times higher than that of White women.
While the infant survival rate has improved dramatically, Black infants still have nearly three times the risk of dying before the age of one compared to White infants.
Not only New York, but also...
Similar statistics can be found anywhere in America.
According to a recent analysis by The New York Times, it seems that there is a shortage of 1.5 million Black men across the United States.
According to the article, it is reported that today, more than one in six Black men aged 25 to 54 are missing from daily life, either due to imprisonment or premature death.
There is a severe injustice where only young Black men are subjected to unjust violence every day, which is the violence targeted by the protests known as #BlackLivesMatter.
However, what should be remembered is that while the incidence rates vary, the occurrence and outcomes of common diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and AIDS continue to happen. These are diseases that lead to a slow and quiet death. Due to premature deaths caused by these diseases, Black individuals are further losing their lives.
When the #BlackLivesMatter movement began, I felt frustration and anger because even in the medical field, the use of the term "racial discrimination" has been avoided in research and work.
Every time I use this word, I wonder if you all also have something to think about.
While medical students dressed as corpses to protest, most of the medical community stood by and did nothing. Despite the ongoing discrimination, which continues to affect the appearance of diseases and mortality rates, my concern is that
In the current trend towards personalized and precision medicine, the pursuit of individualized treatment based on biological and genetic research sometimes leads to inadvertently losing sight of the bigger picture and the daily environment - where people live, grow, work, and love. It is this daily environment that has the most impact on people's health and is harming the health of too many individuals.
As healthcare professionals, we witness severe inequalities in our daily work, whether in clinics or in research. Homeless individuals may not follow a doctor's advice due to more pressing priorities. Transgender youth contemplating suicide is a result of an overly harsh society. Single mothers bear the responsibility for their children's health.
The role of a physician as a healthcare professional is not just to treat patients, but also to call attention and become an advocate for change.
Doctors, regardless of their legitimacy, carry considerable weight in their statements due to their social status, and it should not be wasted.
I regret not speaking up in Zimbabwe and have made a vow to myself. As the Commissioner of Health for New York City, I will make full use of the opportunities available to me, raise awareness, and call for collaboration to improve healthcare disparities.
I will also confront racial discrimination. Please lend a hand as well. When you stand up against gender discrimination, I will also support you. I will support you in addressing any form of inequality.
Now is the time for us to stand up and collectively speak out against structural inequalities.
You don't need to know all the answers to call for change.
It only requires courage.
The health of our patients and all of us is at stake.
