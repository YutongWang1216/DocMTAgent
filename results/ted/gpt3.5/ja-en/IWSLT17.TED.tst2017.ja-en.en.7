I have long admired the sea since I was a child.
It is a wonderful place filled with color and life, a habitat for strange creatures like aliens.
I imagined the large sharks dominating the food chain and envisioned graceful sea turtles swimming across the coral reefs.
Having switched from being a marine biologist to a photographer, I have dedicated most of my work to searching for the enchanted places that I dreamed of when I was young.
As you can see, I have been exploring underwater since I was quite young.
But the first time I truly dove underwater was when I was around 10 years old.
I still vividly remember swimming vigorously and trying to touch an old cannon on the shallow coral.
And finally, when I grasped it and looked up, I was immediately surrounded by colorful fish. That was the day I fell in love with the sea.
Having lived on Earth for 40 years as a conservationist and photographer, Thomas Peschak, I have been fortunate to have the valuable opportunity to explore the magnificent beauty of the sea for National Geographic and the Save Our Seas Foundation.
I have photographed everything, from incredibly large sharks to cute things that fit in the palm of my hand.
I witnessed a very foul-smelling humpback whale feeding just 30cm away in the cold waters off the Great Bear Rainforest in Canada.
I have also witnessed the mating of green sea turtles in the Mozambique Channel.
The ocean and all people on Earth have influenced each other.
And the untouched sea that I dreamed of as a child is becoming increasingly difficult to find.
They are being increasingly cornered and threatened.
We, humanity, have continued to be the primary predators on Earth, but I have gradually witnessed and captured the expanding impact firsthand.
I have long thought that by shocking people with impactful photos, I could get them to take an interest.
There are benefits to this initiative, but I have returned to the basics.
I thought that the best way to bring about change is to appeal to love.
I may be a kind of matchmaker. As a photographer, I have been fortunate to have the valuable opportunity to reveal the hidden animals and entire ecosystems beneath the ocean's surface.
If you don't know it exists, you cannot cherish it or defend it.
Revealing hidden forms is the power of conservation photography.
I have visited hundreds of marine areas, but there are several that have particularly left a deep impression on me.
The first time I experienced such excitement was ten years ago, off the rugged, undeveloped coast of South Africa.
Every year in June and July, a massive school of sardines migrates northward in an event known as the Sardine Run.
There is a valid reason for this.
It is because hungry and swift predators are secretly chasing after them at an incredible speed.
Generally, dolphins hunt in groups, separating some sardines from the school to create a bait ball, a spherical group.
Chasing the fish to the surface of the sea, they feast on this living and moving delicacy.
There is a shark right behind.
Many people believe that dolphins and sharks are natural enemies, but during the Sardine Run, they actually coexist.
Dolphins help sharks efficiently catch their prey.
Without dolphins, the bait ball would be more dispersed, and sharks would get stuck in what is known as a "sardine donut," filling their mouths with water and gaining nothing.
Now, I have also experienced thrilling moments with sharks during the Sardine Run, and I understand that they do not see me as prey.
However, during this rough feast, they also bump into other fish and get hit by fins like the rest.
When moving east from the coast of Africa and crossing the vast Indian Ocean, you will reach the Maldives, which are made of coral.
During the intense southwest monsoon season, from all over the archipelago, the giant manta rays come to a very small spot in the Ba Atoll called Hanifaru. Usually smaller than a person's eye, a large amount of crustaceans are the main food source for the giant manta rays.
When there is a patch of plankton, the giant manta ray feeds alone and repeatedly somersaults backwards, resembling a puppy chasing its own tail.
However, when plankton gathers in one place, the rays line up in a row and create a long chain for feeding. Even if the rays near the front miss some plankton, the following rays will surely swallow it.
As the amount of plankton increases, the rays swim closer to each other, a unique behavior known as Cyclone Feeding.
The rays, in a solid formation, spiral and form multiple layers of columns, creating a vortex to gather and suck in plankton, then carrying it into their cave-like mouths.
Diving surrounded by a group of hundreds of rays is truly an unforgettable experience.
When I first photographed Hanifaru, it was not under protection and was threatened by development.
By working with NGOs like Manta Trust, my photos eventually helped Hanifaru become a marine protected area.
The fishermen from neighboring islands used to catch rays to make traditional drums out of their skins.
Currently, they are the most dedicated in conservation efforts, and thanks to the rays, the Maldives now earn an additional $8 million in revenue annually.
I always wanted to go back in time to eras where maps were mostly blank or marked with "Here be dragons."
Of all the places I have visited, the atoll on the western side of the Indian Ocean was the closest to the seas of such eras.
Diving into such seas far away from shipping lanes and fishing fleets, the vivid memories of the past ocean become strikingly apparent.
Most people have probably never heard of the small coral reef in the Mozambique Channel called Bassas da India.
The coral reef acts as a barrier, and the lagoon inside serves as a breeding ground for Galapagos sharks.
This shark is not very timid, even during the daytime.
I had a hunch that when night fell, they would become bolder and come out more.
Have you ever encountered so many sharks at one coral outcrop before?
Capturing and sharing these moments reminds me of the reason why I chose this path.
This year, I have already worked for National Geographic in the Baja California Peninsula.
About halfway along the Pacific side of the peninsula, there is the San Ignacio Lagoon, which is an important breeding ground for gray whales.
This coastline was a place where mass killings continued for 100 years, with over 20,000 gray whales being killed and only a few hundred surviving.
Currently, the descendants of those whales gently push their own children to the surface of the sea to play and even interact with us.
This species has truly achieved a remarkable revival.
Now, on the opposite side of the peninsula, there is a quiet fishing town called Cabo Pulmo.
It was on the brink of collapse due to decades of overfishing.
In 1995, local fishermen appealed to designate the sea as a marine protected area.
What happened next can only be described as a miracle.
By 2005, only 10 years after the protection began, the number of fish had achieved an unprecedented recovery.
But please see with your own eyes, let's go together.
Take a deep breath, dive deep, and let's swim into the largest and most densely packed school of fish I have ever encountered.
Everyone has the ability to create hope.
Through my photos, I want to convey that it is not too late to protect our oceans.
I particularly want to focus on the resilience of nature when faced with a population of 7.3 billion people.
My wish is to continue taking photos that serve as examples of coexisting with the ocean, as in the future, it will be much harder to capture such images unless we search diligently.
I can only hope that it becomes a regular occurrence.
In order to survive and move forward in my profession, I must be an irrepressible optimist.
I always work under the assumption that around the next corner, beyond that coral, within that lagoon, or just a bit further ahead, there may be a wonderful photograph that prompts change.
