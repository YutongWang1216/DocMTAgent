I majored in political science at university, so I had to write a lot of reports.
The workload for writing reports is likely distributed in this way for the average student.
With this, - at first it may be slow, but if you make sufficient progress in the first week, even if the workload increases in the latter half, an orderly state is maintained.
I also think I would like to do it that way.
As planned
I intend to start right away, but when it comes time to actually work on the report, this is how it ends up for me.
It always ends up like this.
I then had to write a 90-page thesis, which should be written over the course of a year.
I knew that my usual approach wouldn't work.
The scale is too large.
So I made a plan and decided to do it in this way.
It's a one-year plan.
It starts off lightly, rises slightly in the middle, and then sprints towards the end, giving a feeling like climbing a gentle staircase.
Climbing up this staircase
It's not a difficult thing, is it?
However, something strange happened.
The first few months
I came and went, but I couldn't do anything.
Therefore, the plan will be changed like this.
Since then - the middle period has also passed without being able to write, resulting in this state.
Another 2 months became 1 month, and that further turned into 2 weeks.
One morning, I woke up to find that there were only 3 days left until the deadline. I hadn't written a single word yet and there was no room for choices. I had to write a 90-page paper in 72 hours, so I pulled two consecutive all-nighters. The human body is not meant to do such things, but I ran through the campus at full speed, feeling time slow down as I submitted it at the moment of the deadline.
I thought everything had ended with that.
A week later, I received a phone call from the university.
"Are you Mr. Tim Urban?"
"Yes."
"I have something to discuss regarding the submitted thesis."
"Ah."
What I was told was, "I have never seen such a wonderful thesis before."
Such a thing did not happen.
It was a truly terrible paper.
I just wanted everyone to think, even for a moment, "Isn't this person a genius?"
It is a truly terrible paper.
I am currently a writer.
I write a blog called "Wait But Why."
About two years ago, I decided to write about "procrastination."
My behavior always puzzled those around me, so what is happening inside the head of a procrastinator and why are we like that?
I wanted to explain to those who are not procrastinators in the world. I thought there must be differences in the brains of procrastinators and non-procrastinators.
To confirm this, I decided to find a place that would take an MRI of my brain and the brain of a person who is certain not to procrastinate, and compare them.
I am bringing the results here today.
I hope you will pay attention and see if you can notice the differences.
While it may be difficult to understand for non-experts in brain science, please take a look anyway.
This is the brain of a person who is not a procrastinator.
[Rational decision maker], on the other hand
In my brainâ€”
[The monkey who wants an immediate reward] This is the difference between the two.
In both brains, there is a "rational decision maker", but in the case of the procrastinator's brain, there is also "the monkey who wants an immediate reward".
How does that relate to procrastination?
Everything is going smoothly until this point.
"Maybe I should do some work." "No way." The rational decision maker makes a rational decision to do something productive, but the monkey doesn't like that. So, it takes over and says, "Yes, let's read the Wikipedia article about the Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding incident. I just remembered that happened."
And then - I have to go check the refrigerator to see if anything has changed since 10 minutes ago.
After that, the YouTube spiral awaits, starting from a video of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and continuing all the way to an interview with Justin Bieber's mom in the distant future.
So, I'm really busy for a while, sorry, but I'm done for today.
There's no room for adding more work, is there?
What is happening?
The monkey is not the one you want to take the helm.
I am living only in the present moment.
Without memories of the past or knowledge of the future, the only things that matter are simply two: easy and enjoyable things.
In the world of animals, there is no problem with that.
If it's a dog, spending time doing only easy and enjoyable things would be a very successful way of living.
For monkeys, humans are just another species of animals.
It may have been fine to live a primitive life where you eat well, sleep well, and simply produce the next generation, but...
I am not living a primitive life now.
We live in an advanced civilized society, but monkeys do not understand what that is.
There is another "rational decision maker" in the brain, which gives us abilities that other animals do not have.
We imagine the future.
I can see the big picture
Long-term plans can be made.
The rational decision maker takes everything into consideration.
Now, I will try to make myself do what I need to do.
It is also rational to do easy and enjoyable things, such as during dinner, when sleeping, or during leisure time.
There are overlapping aspects between the two.
There are also times when opinions align.
However, there are cases where it is rational to do something difficult and not very enjoyable from a broader perspective.
Conflicts arise in such situations.
In the case of procrastinators, this conflict tends to always end up with the same result, leading to spending a lot of time in the orange-colored areas. It is doing easy and enjoyable things that are not rational to do.
I call this area the "dark playground."
The dark playground is a place that all procrastinators are familiar with.
It is a place where you end up playing when you should not be playing.
The enjoyment in the dark playground is not actually enjoyable; it is filled with familiar procrastination sensations such as guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-loathing associated with pleasure that should not be indulged in.
The problem is how procrastinators can transition from the situation where the monkey is steering to the blue area, where comfort is lacking but truly important things happen.
In fact, procrastinators have a guardian angel who always watches over them, even in the worst times, known as the "Panic Monster."
The "Panic Monster" usually sleeps, but when a deadline is approaching, or a terrifying outcome such as losing face or facing a professional crisis is imminent, it suddenly wakes up.
What is important is that it is the only thing that the monkey fears.
Recently, I had the opportunity to be taken care of by them. Six months ago, the TED people contacted me and invited me to do a TED talk.
Of course, I answered, "I will do it."
It has been a long-time dream to be able to say, "I have done a TED talk in the past."
"I have done a TED talk before." In the midst of this excitement, the rational decision maker is focused on something else.
"Do you understand what you've taken on?"
Do you understand what will happen one day in the future?
"We need to sit down and get started right away!"
The monkey responds, "I totally agree, but for now, let's open Google Earth, zoom in to 60m above ground level at the southern tip of India, scroll for two and a half hours, and once we reach the top, we should have a good grasp of India's image, don't you think?"
And so, on that day, I kept doing that.
As 6 months turned into 4, then 2, and finally 1, TED released the list of speakers.
When I opened that page, my own face was staring back at me.
So, who woke up?
The Panic Monster went into a frenzy, and the entire system immediately fell into chaos.
Remember that the monkey fears the Panic Monster, so it escapes up the tree.
With this, finally, the rational decision maker can take the helm, and I was able to start preparing for the lecture.
Thanks to the Panic Monster, even the most outrageous behavior of a procrastinator can be explained. It is like a miracle when, unable to write a single line of the report for two weeks, they suddenly awaken to a strong work ethic and end up writing eight pages overnight.
This is the overall situation with three characters, the procrastinator system.
It may not be beautiful, but it ultimately works.
This is the content that I decided to write on my blog two years ago.
When I wrote it, I was surprised by the reaction on the blog.
Literally, thousands of emails were received from all over the world, from a wide variety of people.
Nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and a great number of graduate students.
Everyone was writing the same thing, "I also have the same issue."
However, the lightness of the blog post and the weight of the emails received were contrasting.
It was written with a strong frustration towards the impact procrastination is having on their lives, wondering what kind of experiences they are going through because of the monkey.
Looking at that, I thought, "The procrastinator system works, but what's going on?"
Why are they in such a gloomy state?
What we understand is that there are also two types of procrastination.
In the examples I shared, there were deadlines.
When there is a deadline, the impact of procrastination is limited to a short period, and the Panic Monster appears.
However, there is another type of procrastination where there are no deadlines.
For entrepreneurial work such as individual entrepreneurs or artists, there are no deadlines at first, so nothing happens until you go out, do something, get on track, and start running.
There are also many important things outside of work that do not have deadlines, such as visiting family, exercising to maintain health, building relationships with others, or resolving problematic relationships.
If the only mechanism for procrastinators to tackle such difficult tasks is the Panic Monster, there is a problem because the Panic Monster does not appear in situations without deadlines.
Without something to awaken them, the influence of procrastination is not limited, leading to a continuous cycle of procrastination indefinitely.
Such long-term procrastination of this kind is often overlooked compared to the comical and short-term deadline-driven procrastination, and may not be discussed as much. Typically, one quietly suffers from it.
Long-term and significant unhappiness or regret
I thought that could be the reason why those people wrote emails, and the reason they are in such a terrible situation.
It doesn't mean that you are stuck in a can with a project.
Long-term procrastination makes you feel like a bystander in your own life.
Their frustration is not about not being able to achieve their dreams, but about not even being able to start chasing their dreams.
While reading such emails, I had a realization that there is no such thing as a person who is not a procrastinator.
Everyone is a procrastinator.
Even if you're not as chaotic as me, you might be able to maintain a healthy relationship with deadlines. However, please be aware that the most insidious issue with the monkey is when there are no deadlines.
Finally, there is one more thing I would like to show you.
It's called the "Life Calendar."
Each box represents a week in a 90-year life span.
There aren't that many left, and besides, we have already used quite a lot.
I think we should all take a close look at this calendar.
Everyone should be procrastinating something, so what is it that I am truly procrastinating?
It is necessary to be aware of the monkey who wants an immediate reward.
This is a job for all of us.
Considering that there aren't that many boxes left, this task should be started today.
Well, even if it's not right away today
If possible
Before it's too late.
Thank you very much.
