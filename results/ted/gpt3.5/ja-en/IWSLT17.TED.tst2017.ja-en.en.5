Food crisis
It has been in the news regularly.
What does that mean?
In the world, there are places where food is in short supply or in excess.
On the other hand, GMOs are saving the world.
There may also be issues with GMOs.
Excessive agricultural runoff contaminates the sea, causing the influx of toxins and reducing nutrient levels.
This kind of thing continues endlessly.
I am very disappointed with the current discussions on the environment.
How can we use our knowledge to find a solution?
Let's take a look at the food issue of apples.
You all probably ate at least one apple last week.
How long do you think it has been since that apple was picked?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months - the average time for apples to be displayed in American grocery stores
There doesn't seem to be much difference in Europe and other countries around the world.
After picking the apples, they are stored in the refrigerator, where a preserving gas is sealed in. There are records of workers entering this storage room to retrieve apples and dying. This is because the air that delays the decay of apples is toxic to humans.
Why did no one know about this?
Why didn't I know about it?
90% of the antioxidant components in apples are lost by the time they are eaten.
This is just a lump of sugar.
Why are we so lacking in information? What are the ways to improve this?
It is because the platform is lacking.
Speaking of platforms, computers were used for some really dangerous things online when I was young.
I did it on this platform.
However, I was also able to meet people and express myself.
How can you express yourself using food?
If there is a platform, you can freely ask "What if..."
My question was this: What if the climate were equal for everyone?
This is a map of the world's climate.
Places with high productivity are shown in green, while low productivity areas are shown in red.
Colors shift and change. The agricultural center that was once in California has now moved to Mexico.
China is growing better food on Brazilian land. We are subject to the climate.
What if each country had a climate suitable for production?
How will it change people's lives?
Will it change the quality of life and nutrition?
For the previous generation, the issue was obtaining more food at a lower cost.
Welcome to the world of global farming.
Humanity has constructed a massive analog farm.
The lines depicted here represent food transportation connected by vehicles such as cars, airplanes, and trains.
It is miraculous that the food supporting a population of 7 billion people is produced by a small percentage of the population.
What if...
What if we could build a digital farm?
These are digital farms spreading around the world.
What if we could take this apple out, digitize it in some way, propagate it as particles in the air, and reconstruct it in another location?
What if...
I was inspired by reading the text written here to start this research.
First, there is no young labor, water, land, or future in Japanese agriculture. Seeing this, I headed straight to Minamisoma, just north of Fukushima, which had been affected by the disaster at that time.
Due to the contaminated land, children moved to Sendai and Tokyo. Japan already relies on imports for 70% of its food.
The food issue is not limited to Japan.
In America, only 2% of the population is involved in agriculture.
No matter the country, with only 2%, the things that can be done are limited.
Looking at other countries, 50% of the population in Africa is under 18 years old.
80% of them do not want to become farmers.
Farming is hard work, so...
The lives of farmers engaged in small-scale agriculture are miserable.
They flow into urban areas.
In India, farmers are not even receiving supplies of water or electricity, and the number of farmers who committed suicide this year was the highest in the past 10 years.
It's a really unpleasant story.
Where will the farmers go?
Urban area.
Young people do not stay in their hometowns, everyone flows into urban areas.
How can we build a platform that will stimulate young people?
Introducing the new model of tractor!
This is the combine harvester I have created.
Many years ago, I went to daily goods stores and DIY shops and started crafting.
I started making strange things, trying to make plants dance. When I connected the plants to the computer, they all withered. It was a huge number.
Finally, I was able to make it so they wouldn't wither.
In my life, I built one of the most intimate relationships, which is starting to understand the language of plants.
When you wish to grow bigger
They said, "Go for it!"
There is only an old electrical laboratory here that no one wants to enter.
"What do you think you can do?"
Together with my colleagues, we built a farm at the MIT Media Lab. This place has been known not as a biology lab, but as a research institute for digital life.
In this approximately 6 square meter space, we produced enough food for 300 people every month. It may not be a large quantity, but...
Many intriguing technologies have been implemented there, but...
What is the most intriguing thing among them?
Beautiful white roots, dark green vegetables, and monthly harvests
Is this a new type of cafeteria?
A new retail experience?
A new grocery store?
One thing can be said for certain, this is the first case of harvesting something from the roots at the Media Lab.
The bag contains salad, but there are no issues whatsoever.
However, what will happen if experts in image processing, data scientists, and researchers in robotics, while harvesting something from the roots, think, "If I use my knowledge, I can do this. Let's try it"?
Before taking the plants outside, we first try to keep them in the lab. Why? Because we don't want to discard what we have grown. They are valuable.
My palate is different - first, I will taste it myself. I do not want to feed it to others until I confirm that it is a decent food product.
So, I eat lettuce every day because the pH of lettuce can be determined within a margin of error of 0.1.
"It's pH 6.1, so I can't eat it today." It's like this.
The lettuce of that day was incredibly sweet.
Plants are exposed to stress and undergo chemical reactions internally to protect themselves, which makes them very sweet. "I don't want to die."
The cries of such plants make a flavor that I like very sweet.
A scientific engineer who shifted to plant physiology...
I thought about making this experiment replicable by others.
I am very curious about what will be created, so I thought about creating a lab that can be delivered anywhere.
First, I tried making it.
My lab is located on the front side of the Media Lab, with approximately 30 sensors installed per plant.
If you are familiar with genomics and genetic engineering, this is what is known as a so-called phenotype.
It originates from the word "phenomenon."
For example, saying "I prefer strawberries from Mexico" means that you actually prefer strawberries that have grown in a climate conducive to your taste.
So, if we can create that climate through programming - using combinations like carbon dioxide and oxygen levels as recipes - we can program the flavor, nutrients, size, shape, color, and texture of plants.
Data is required for this, so we have installed many sensors to understand the situation. When you think about indoor gardening plants and look at this, you will feel very sad. "Why are you dying? Talk to me."
Farmers develop the amazing ability to predict plant growth from their late 60s to early 70s.
When plants are starting to wither, they understand reasons like nitrogen deficiency, calcium deficiency, or the need for humidity.
This amazing ability is not inherited.
This is data stored by a farmer on the cloud.
Track the changes in the data over time.
We will correlate these data with individual plants.
These are representations of laboratory broccoli on a certain day using IP addresses.
It is broccoli that can be assigned an IP address.
(Applause) If you still feel that there is not enough strangeness, click here to see the profiles of the plants.
This is downloadable data regarding the growth of the plant we just discussed. It may exceed your imagination, not only in terms of when it can be eaten, but also
The timing when the necessary nutrients are obtained
We predict the timing to achieve the preferred taste.
Are you watering too much?
Are you not taking in too much sunlight?
Warnings are also issued.
He talks to me, he is intellectual, we share a common language.
(Applause) I sometimes think of myself as the first user of the plant world's Facebook.
The previous one was the profile of a plant, and that plant begins to make friends.
Consuming less nitrogen, more phosphorus, and less potassium than other plants
It should be a good match. At the moment, I can only speculate and am also learning about the complexity of plant relationships.
Plants may not recognize us as friends, but there is a possibility. It all depends on our actions.
This is my current lab.
There is a bit more order than before. I have experience in setting up data centers in various hospitals, so I have some knowledge in creating managed environments.
Furthermore, I am attempting all sorts of experiments in this environment.
This method, hydroponics, was developed by NASA to reduce the amount of water carried into space for the meals space station.
Here, we provide plants with exactly what they need - water, minerals, and oxygen.
Root growth is simple, and by providing what is necessary, plants grow beautifully like this.
Plants seem to have two hearts, just like the human body.
With two hearts, they grow four to five times faster.
It's a perfect world.
Humanity has advanced technology over the years and obtained seeds that can grow in harsh environments. Technological innovation continues, but now we have created a new method. It's a perfect world.
We have cultivated various types of plants.
This type of tomato has not been commercially produced for 150 years.
Did you know that humanity has a rare and ancient seed bank?
It's about seed storage facilities.
It's wonderful.
Some seeds are preserved with live reproductive material, and there are seeds that no one has ever tasted.
I am the only one who has eaten this tomato in the lab.
The problem is that this is a tomato for sauce, and I don't know how to cook it. I tried eating the sauce tomatoes, but they are not tasty.
Using protein, we tried to cultivate various things.
Humans might be able to do it too, but in reality, they are not doing it.
Now, what I have come to understand is that the equipment is large and very costly.
I thought about spreading it all over the world, but the equipment ended up costing about 10 million yen.
It's not easy to find someone who can easily come up with 10 million yen, so I decided to make something smaller.
This project was actually carried out by one of my students, Camille, a undergraduate student studying mechanical engineering.
Camille, my colleagues and I conducted repeated experiments throughout the summer, aiming to create something that is more affordable, functions better, and can be made by anyone.
Next, I brought this to middle and high schools.
If you want to be underestimated by others, try teaching something to children.
I went to the school and said, "Set the humidity to 65%."
A 7th grade student asks, "What is humidity?"
I answered, "It's about the water in the air."
He responds, "There's no water in the air, you fool."
I replied, "You don't have to believe me.
You don't have to believe.
Try setting it to 100%.
He set it to 100% - what do you think will happen?
The moisture condenses into mist and eventually water droplets fall.
He said, "Oh, humidity refers to rain, right?"
"Why didn't you say that?"
We created an input screen that was like a game.
It is a 3D display that can be accessed from anywhere in the world, whether on a smartphone or tablet.
You can operate various devices and sensors on the bot.
You can also choose recipes created by children from around the world.
When you select a recipe and start, seedlings will be planted.
Changes can be made during growth.
"Why do plants need CO2? Isn't it harmful? It can kill people, right?"
You may also hear such words.
When the CO2 concentration is increased, plants die.
When the CO2 concentration is reduced, plants become very healthy.
When the plants are harvested, a new digital recipe is completed.
It is a process of designing, developing, and exploring repeatedly.
You can download the new data and digital recipes related to the plants they have developed, and the question is - are the changes effective or the opposite?
Consider these as the core components of the development process.
We will learn a lot.
This is what we call a food computer, during three weeks at school.
It will grow this much in three weeks.
What is even more important is that this child, for the first time, thought, "Can I become a farmer too?" or perhaps even thought, "I want to become a farmer."
So we made all the data open.
Everything is online. Let's try assembling a food computer at home.
It might be a little difficult, but―
This is a newly started initiative, but everything is in place.
It is very important to be easily accessible.
We will make it more familiar.
They are farmers, electricians, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, plant scientists, economists, and urban planners.
We will perform our own expertise on one platform.
This lab has become cramped.
This is the new facility that I have just started using.
Warehouses like this can be found anywhere.
That is the reason I chose.
I am trying to make something like this inside the warehouse.
This already exists.
Please take a look.
This also already exists.
They are each cultivating green vegetables and Ebola vaccines.
One of the reasons these plants won in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Grand Challenge was their advanced research on Ebola, which is fantastic.
This plant produces proteins resistant to Ebola.
From pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements to lettuce.
While it is completely different from lettuce, this is the field that I am researching.
It is completely different in every aspect.
We are still in the early chaos state― it's like our "black box"― "Buy mine."
"No, I own very valuable intellectual property rights."
His is no good, buy mine.
In reality, it has only just begun, and society is in the process of changing.
People are increasingly seeking more affordable food while also seeking higher quality, environmentally friendly food.
The fact that McDonald's has disclosed the contents of chicken nuggets, which have always been considered the most suspicious food at any time, indicates that they are conducting marketing in line with changes in society.
Now let's take a look at the modern world.
Individual food computers, food servers, and food data centers - operated in an open phenome.
Unlike open genomics, ours is more like a wiki with a little added climate recipe. You can start and grow by selecting from the drop-down menu.
How does this initiative appear on a global scale?
Do you remember when the world was connected by lines?
First, set up the oscillator.
We will start disseminating information about food instead of sending food itself.
Not just my fantasy, but already spreading in such places.
Food computers, food servers, and food data centers are being created, and through information sharing, people will be connected.
The future of food supply does not involve fighting the inherent flaws.
We know what the flaws are.
The future of food supply involves connecting the next billion farmers through a network, enabling the raising of issues and providing solutions through platform provision. "What if..."
Thank you very much.
