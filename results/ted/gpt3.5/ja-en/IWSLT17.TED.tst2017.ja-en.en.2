My hometown is Seattle, the most free, tolerant, and progressive place in all of America.
I was raised in a wonderful Seattle family.
My mother is an artist and my father is a university professor. I am very grateful for the environment in which I was raised, as I have always been able to freely determine my own way of life without any reservations.
In reality, I did not follow the path that my parents had envisioned.
I dropped out of college at the age of 19 - whether it was a dropout or withdrawal, it doesn't really matter.
And I began to tour around as a professional French horn player, something I had always dreamed of.
While engaging in chamber music performances, I traveled across America and Europe, and for several years, I collaborated with the outstanding jazz guitarist Charlie Bird.
And by the end of my twenties, I became a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a wonderful life it is.
My parents never complained.
They have always supported me.
It was not their ideal, but you know.
It is said that he told neighbors and friends, "My son is in the middle of a gap year - about 10 years."
But - there was only one awkward conversation about my way of life, so let's talk about it.
I was 27 years old and was visiting home from Barcelona during the Christmas break, cooking together with my mother in the kitchen, just the two of us.
My mother became silent, too silentâ€”
I thought something was strange, so
When I asked, "Mom, what are you thinking?"
My mother said, "We are very worried about you."
"What do you mean?" I wondered what she could be talking about now.
"Please answer me honestly - you didn't vote for the Republican Party, did you?"
Well, the truth is, I was just a French horn player who wasn't really interested in politics.
My parents, who noticed something and realized it, were a little bewildered.
I had become a fervent supporter of capitalism. Let me explain how that happened.
It all stems from something that I have always been interested in for a long time, which may come as a surprise - "poverty."
I remember the first time I saw real poverty during my childhood in Seattle.
My family was lower middle class, but of course, it wasn't true poverty.
It was a distant thing.
The first time I saw poverty and the face of poverty was in the early 1970s when I was 6 or 7 years old.
It was just a common, mundane experience that everyone has probably experienced as well.
It is a photo that was published in National Geographic, showing a child around my age in East Africa with flies on their face and a swollen belly.
It was clear that there was no longer any way to save them, and there was nothing I could do.
Some people may remember that photo, not necessarily the exact same one, but a similar one.
It is a photo that made the poverty that continues to afflict the world known to Western countries.
That image burned into my mind as I grew up, attended school, dropped out, returned to school, started a family, and yet I could never forget it.
I wondered what happened to that child.
I wonder what happened to people like that child all over the world.
So I began to investigate. Although I wasn't in college at the time, I was searching for answers. What happened to the people living in the extreme poverty of the world?
Did it worsen or improve? What on earth happened?
And when I found the answer, my life changed. I will share that with all of you.
Now, most Americans believe that poverty has worsened. They think that compared to when they were children - the time of that photo - it has worsened.
If you were to ask Americans whether global poverty has worsened or improved, 70% would answer that hunger has worsened since the early 1970s.
Now, let me tell you the truth.
This is the enlightenment that changed my perspective on the world.
Between 1970 and today, the percentage of people living in hunger - those living on less than $1 a day - in the world's population has decreased by 80%, adjusting for inflation.
The world's worst poverty has decreased by 80% compared to when I was a child.
I didn't know such a thing.
Everyone, this is a miracle.
This is something to be happy about.
As a poverty alleviation measure, it is the greatest achievement in human history, and it happened in our generation.
(Applause) When I learned about this, I had a question: What made this achievement possible?
If you don't understand why it was achieved, you cannot reproduce it.
To replicate this and further lift 2 billion people out of poverty - that is the main point, you see - from my childhood to now, our 2 billion brothers and sisters, the "least of these" as mentioned in the Bible, have escaped poverty.
I want to know how to save an additional 2 billion people.
So I began to search for answers.
Politics had nothing to do with the answer. It didn't matter to me.
I still have no interest.
I wanted the best answer from mainstream economists, regardless of right, left, or centrist views.
Let me tell you the answer.
There are five key success factors.
We have lifted our 2 billion brothers and sisters worldwide out of poverty up to today.
The first key factor is globalization.
The second key factor is free trade.
The third key factor is property rights.
The fourth key factor is the rule of law.
The fifth key factor is entrepreneurship.
Since the 1970s, the world has been able to transition to a system of free enterprise, making it possible.
However, I am not that simple either.
I understand that free enterprise is not perfect, and I also understand that there are other things necessary to build a better world besides free enterprise.
But it's amazing.
This is a problem that goes beyond politics.
What I have learned and realized
The significance of capitalism extends beyond the accumulation of wealth.
The best aspect of capitalism is the ambition. Many people will talk about ambition on this stage, meaning the ambition born from desires is deeply connected to the free enterprise system.
We must spread this ambition further.
Now, let's talk about the second enlightenment here, which is related to the first enlightenment and brings progress not only worldwide but also to the city we are in now.
Among all the words I have heard so far, the idea about poverty relief that I just talked about is the most well-summarized: "There is no system in human history that has created wealth as effectively as the free market."
We have lifted billions of people out of poverty, after all.
Whose words are these?
It sounds like names such as Milton Friedman and Ronald Reagan.
That's not correct.
It is President Barack Obama.
Why can you say that in the first place?
Because I was told directly.
You won't believe it.
What came out of my mouth was "Banzai!"
In addition, I also thought, "What a wonderful opportunity."
Do you know what I was thinking?
In May 2015, during an event on this theme, at Georgetown University.
I thought this is the solution to the biggest problem America is facing. What do you think it is?
Regardless of liberal or conservative views, the idea that the free market solves poverty is to reach out to those who need us the most.
You should all know that crises are happening in America and all around the world because of political polarization, even without me saying it.
We have now reached a critical situation on the brink.
This is an unpleasant situation, this won't do.
Last year, a paper was published in the "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America," which is the most prestigious scientific journal published in the West.
The theme of the 2014 paper was "asymmetry of political motives."
This is, in psychological terms, to determine that one's own ideology is born from love, while the worldview of the enemy is born from hatred.
It is common in conflicts around the world.
For example, this is a phenomenon seen between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the authors of this paper discovered is that in today's America, both the Republican and Democratic parties have fallen into a mindset of "asymmetry of political motives" shared by the majority of people.
Today, the majority of politically passionate people in America believe that they themselves are motivated by love, while the opposing side is motivated by hatred.
Just think about it, okay?
Most people's thoughts are like this: "My ideology is based on very basic tolerance. I want to help people, but others are villains trying to trap me."
As long as this kind of asymmetry exists, society cannot move forward.
It's impossible.
So what is the solution?
First, let's be honest. It's natural to have differences.
It's not that simple, so don't underestimate the differences.
There are many excellent studies on this topic.
Veteran TED speaker and friend Jonathan Haidt
I am a professor of psychology at New York University.
I am researching the differences in ideologies, values, and moral perspectives of various people.
According to him, for example, conservatives and liberals place a significant emphasis on different things.
For example, according to Haidt, among liberals, there are 59% more people who care about poverty issues than those who prioritize economic freedom.
Among conservatives, there are 28% more people who prioritize economic freedom than those who care about poverty issues.
It doesn't seem like this gap will narrow, does it?
"Never able to get along? That's a mistake."
This is diversity, and this is where our strength lies.
Do you remember what saved the poor?
The obsession with poverty issues led to the spread of the means of free market around the world.
In other words, we need each other. If we want to help people and lift the next 2 billion out of poverty, we must work together.
There is no other way.
Now
How can this be achieved?
It's difficult, isn't it?
We need innovative thinking.
There are many on this platform.
Social entrepreneurship - that's right, absolutely right. It's amazing, isn't it?
We need sustainable, ethical, moral, and responsible foreign investmentâ€”
Exactly right! But what is truly necessary?
It is a new world with flexible ideologies.
We need more surprise.
Right?
Have you ever felt that your ideology has become too rigid?
Doesn't it feel kind of clichÃ©?
Have you ever thought that you're only listening to people who share the same opinions as you?
Why is this dangerous?
Because when discussing the economy in this country, on the right side, there are conservatives who only talk about taxes, regulations, and big government.
On the left side, there are liberals who always talk about income inequality when discussing the economy.
Both are important, to me and to you.
Today, when it comes to the discussion of rescuing people suffering from hunger and in need of help from poverty, this becomes an obstacle.
We should cooperate under the best way to alleviate poverty by utilizing the highest level of tools available to us freely. This requires conservatives to recognize the attachment of liberals to their poverty issues, and for liberals to recognize the attachment of conservatives to their free market, in order for mutual cooperation to become possible.
This diversity, if accepted, will become one of America's strengths in the future.
So, how can we together achieve this?
We need a list of activities, not just for everyone, but for myself as well.
Item 1 - Please remember that simply tolerating people with different opinions is not enough.
That is not enough.
We must remember that we need people who do not agree with us, because there are still people waiting to benefit from the tools provided by our diversity.
Now, what should I do? How should I convey it?
Where should we start? Here.
We are all in this room, and we are blessed.
I am blessed with people who listen to me.
I am also blessed with success and leadership.
They may listen even if you talk about unexpected ideologies.
Progress may start from there.
That's the first one, now onto the second.
I have an ideal persona that I want you to become, and that I also want to become. Specifically, it is someone who can blur the boundaries, someone who is not easily categorized and falls in between.
Conservatives who always speak about poverty, conservatives who speak of the moral duty to fight for the poor.
Liberals who always speak about the benefits of the free market when responsibly utilized to solve our issues.
By doing so, two things can be achieved.
First, we can start addressing the salvation of the next 2 billion people and continue to work on the necessary solutions as we have seen in the past.
Second, we can transform the terrifyingly sacred ideological battle we are experiencing in this country into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect. We can turn it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
By doing so, perhaps, just perhaps, we will realize that the significant differences we think exist are not ultimately that big.
Thank you very much.
