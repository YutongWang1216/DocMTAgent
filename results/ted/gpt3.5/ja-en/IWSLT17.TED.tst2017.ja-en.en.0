This is a discussion about how we acquire knowledge.
The main character of the story is this woman, Natalia Liptinskaya.
He is a paleontologist who specializes in excavating ancient remains.
Natalia Liptinskaya: I had people calling me "Doctor Bones"
Latif Nasser: What I found particularly interesting was that the excavation site is in the remote tundra region of Canada, far north in the Arctic Circle.
One summer day in 2006, she was at an excavation site called Files Reef Bed, with a latitude of only 10 degrees to the magnetic North Pole.
Natalia: You might think it's boring, but all I do is walk around all day carrying a backpack with a GPS and a notebook, picking up things that look like fossils.
Latif: At one point, she noticed something.
Natalia: It was an old, palm-sized reddish-brown object.
It was lying on the ground.
Latif: At first, I thought it was just a piece of wood. This is because at Files Reef Bed, fragments of ancient plants are often found.
However, when they returned to the camp that night ―
Natalia: When I took out the magnifying glass and looked at it more closely, I realized that there were no growth rings.
It may be due to the preservation condition, but the more you look at it —
It was bones.
Latif: She visited this spot more than four years and collected a total of 30 fragments of the same bones, most of which are very small.
Natalia: The number is not large, it fits in a small plastic bag.
Latif: She tried to put the fragments together like a puzzle, but
It was truly a difficult task.
Natalia: It was shattered into pieces, so I tried to use sand and putty, but it didn't work well.
So in the end, I used a 3D scanner.
Latif: Amazing! Natalia: Right?
Latif: It's much easier to work on the screen.
Natalia: I was a little moved when everything came together.
Latif: How confident were you that the assembly was correct?
If you tried assembling it differently, is there a possibility it could turn into something else? Like, it was actually a parrot?
Natalia: No, there is no mistake.
Latif: What she discovered were metatarsal bones, which are leg bones, and they belonged to an artiodactyl, which refers to animals like cows and sheep.
However, these bones did not belong to animals like cows or sheep.
It was too big.
Natalia: It was an extra-large size, a very large animal.
Latif: What kind of animal was it?
Feeling stuck, she showed one of the bone fragments to her colleague from Colorado, and that's when she had a breakthrough.
Natalia: When we made an incision on the edge of the bone with a saw, it had a distinctive smell.
Latif: It smelled like burnt meat.
In the eerie autopsy room, the smell Natalia detected when she dissected the skull was the same as collagen.
Collagen plays a role in maintaining the structure of bones.
Over time, they typically decompose.
In this case, the Arctic Circle's climate acted as a natural refrigerator, preserving the remains.
One to two years later, when Natalia attended a conference in Bristol, her scholarly colleague Mike Buckley was demonstrating a new processing method called "collagen analysis."
Animals each have slightly different structures of collagen, so if the characteristics of the collagen in unknown bones can be identified, they can be compared to those of known animals, and possibly identified.
So, she sent one bone fragment by courier.
Natalia: Because it was something important, I wanted to track it.
Latif: He processed the bone fragments and compared them to 37 modern mammal species.
I found a matching animal.
The owner of the 3.5 million-year-old bones excavated by Natalia in the high latitude Arctic Circle is none other than
It was a camel.
Natalia thought, "Huh?" If it's true, it's amazing.
Latif: I examined many bone fragments, but the results were all the same.
However, judging from the size of the discovered bones, this camel was actually 30% larger than modern ones.
The height was approximately 2.7 meters, and the weight was about 1 ton.
That's right.
What Natalia discovered was a "giant Arctic camel."
When you hear the word camel, what comes to mind is the Bactrian camel that inhabits East and Central Asia.
The image of a postcard in your mind is probably of the Bactrian camel here. When it comes to desert creatures, this is it. Living in hot deserts like the Middle East and the Sahara, they store water in their large humps for long desert journeys and stride across sand dunes with their wide feet.
Why on earth did such an animal reach the Arctic Circle in northern Canada?
In fact, there is something that scientists have known before Natalia's discovery. Actually, the original home of camels is America.
It was born here.
It has been about 45 million years since camels appeared, and during nearly 40 million years of that time, they were distributed only in North America, with approximately 20 species, probably even more.
Latif: Did you notice the difference when you lined them all up?
Natalia: Yes, the sizes of the bodies vary.
There were also species with very long necks, similar to a giraffe's neck.
Latif: There were also ones with faces like crocodiles.
Natalia: The early primitive camels were very small, about the size of a rabbit.
Latif: Huh? A camel the size of a rabbit?
Natalia: It's an early species.
You wouldn't understand even if you looked, would you?
Latif: I'd like to try raising a rabbit camel.
Natalia: Yes, it will definitely be amazing.
Latif: Subsequently, 3 to 7 million years ago, camel herds descended to South America and became llamas and alpacas. Another species crossed the Bering Land Bridge and went to Asia and Africa.
At the end of the last Ice Age, camels in North America became extinct.
Up to this point, it is already known. However, the fact that it was discovered so far north does not completely explain it.
For example, in terms of temperature, it is completely opposite to the Sahara Desert.
Indeed, the temperature 3.5 million years ago was on average 22 degrees higher than it is today.
Therefore, it is possible that there were coniferous forests spread out, similar to the current Yukon River basin and Siberia.
However, even so, winter lasted for six months, and the pond would have frozen.
There are also blizzards.
There may have been periods when the darkness of night lasted for 24 hours.
So what exactly
How did this superstar of the Sahara Desert manage to survive in the climate of the Arctic Circle?
Natalia and her fellow scholars believe they have found the answer.
And it is a splendid answer.
What if the characteristics of camels that we have believed to adapt to places like the Sahara Desert actually evolved to survive the winter?
What if the wide feet were not for walking on sand, but rather for walking on snow like snowshoes?
What if the humps on their backs - I was surprised to learn this, but they are actually filled with fat, not water - helped them survive the six-month-long winter with limited food?
What if, after crossing the land bridge, they evolved winter-adapted features that proved useful in the hot desert environment?
For example, humps might be useful even in hot climates because if all the body fat is stored in one place like a backpack, the fat can act as insulation, eliminating the need to cover the entire body.
Then it will be easier to release heat.
This incredible idea may actually serve as evidence that what was thought to be a typical example of adaptation to the desert environment could in fact be evidence of having once lived in the high-latitude Arctic Circle.
This is not the first time I have told this story.
Others have used this story to discuss the wonders of evolutionary biology and as a clue to unraveling future climate change.
But the reason I like this story is different.
For me, this is a story about myself, our worldview, and how it changes.
I have received education as a historian.
What has become clear is that the majority of scientists are also historians.
They also try to understand the past.
We will discuss the history of the universe, planets, and life on Earth.
And as a historian, we begin by considering the development of the story.
Natalia: We create stories and are dedicated to them. For example, the story of the desert camel.
This is a very well-crafted story. Camels have adapted perfectly.
Since they have been in the desert for a long time.
Latif: But someday, small pieces of evidence may be found.
By understanding small details, you may end up reconstructing everything you believed in.
In this case as well, yes, it was a fossil fragment discovered by a scientist that led science to a completely new hypothesis beyond conventional wisdom as to why this animal, which seems like it could appear in a Dr. Seuss book, has such a form.
My perception of camels has completely changed.
I changed my perspective from viewing camels as extremely specialized animals that can only adapt to specific desert environments, to realizing that they happen to be in the Sahara Desert, but in reality, they are animals that can thrive anywhere in the world.
(Applause) This is Azuli.
Hello Azuli, good morning.
Here, please eat.
Azuli usually performs at the Radio City Music Hall, but
This is no joke.
Now, Azuli is living proof that the story of our world is dynamic.
We must reconstruct the story and reimagine it.
Right? Azuli.
Beyond a single bone lies a new perspective on the world.
Thank you very much.
