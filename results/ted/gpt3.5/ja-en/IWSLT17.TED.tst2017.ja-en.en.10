Hello.
My name is Matthew Williams, and I am a champion.
I have won medals in three sports competitions at the national level in Canada. In basketball, I have participated in world-level games and had the honor of representing Canada in the world championships.
(Applause) I practice basketball and speed skating five days a week, supported by top-class coaches and a mental performance consultant to help me perform at my best in competitions.
By the way, all of this is about the Special Olympics.
Does hearing that change the way you see me or my accomplishments?
The world does not necessarily see people like me as champions.
Until recently, people like me were alienated and did not appear in public.
Since the beginning of the Special Olympics in 1968, things have changed significantly, but in many cases, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the wider world.
Everyone does not think it is wrong to use discriminatory language in front of me.
They use the word "retarded" in a derogatory manner.
They do not consider how much my friends and I are hurt by that.
Please do not think of me as an object of pity here.
The reason I am here is because there are still serious issues in society's perception of people with intellectual disabilities, or rather, the problem lies in the fact that in too many cases, nothing is being seen.
Did you know that there was a world championship this year?
I was one of the 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities who gathered in LA to compete, with participants from 165 countries.
Over 62,000 spectators watched the opening ceremony, which was broadcast live by the sports television networks TSN and ESPN.
You didn't know about such a tournament, did you?
What do you think when you see someone like me?
This is a challenge to everyone. Will you be able to see us as equals?
The Special Olympics also change the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities, as well as the values of all spectators.
For those who are unfamiliar, the Special Olympics is targeted towards athletes with intellectual disabilities.
The Paralympics are completely different from the Olympics.
High-level sports competitions held throughout the year for individuals with intellectual disabilities will change the lives and values of those involved.
With this, my life and the lives of many other people have changed.
And society's perception of people with intellectual disabilities has also changed.
I was born with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities.
I played hockey from a young age until I was 12 years old.
As I grew older, it became increasingly difficult to keep up with everyone, which was frustrating and infuriating.
I was completely away from sports for a while, didn't have many friends, and felt sad and left behind.
In ancient times, people with intellectual disabilities were hidden from society.
No one ever thought that I could participate in sports, let alone be a valuable member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, studied the impact of regular exercise on the motor abilities of children with intellectual disabilities.
Through rigorous scientific research methods, Dr. Hayden and other researchers concluded that "the low motor abilities of children with intellectual disabilities are simply due to a lack of opportunities to participate in physical activities."
For individuals with intellectual disabilities, participation in exercise programs and sports competitions is beneficial.
Few people believed, but pioneers like Dr. Hayden and the founder of the Special Olympics, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, did not give up. And the athletes have proven over 4.5 million times that they were right.
(Applause) Before participating in the Special Olympics, I was anxious. I was young, shy, lacked confidence, and had few friends.
But when I tried it, everyone encouraged and supported me, and there, I could be myself without worrying about other people's eyes.
Now I am a player in basketball and speed skating, having participated in state and national competitions. This year, I achieved the opportunity to compete in the summer World Championships held in LA. I advanced to the world championships for the first time as a member of the Canadian team.
(Applause) I am one of over 4.5 million athletes in the world. I have heard many similar stories.
By being athletes in the Special Olympics, we regain our pride and dignity.
The Special Olympics also meet the important health needs of athletes.
According to research, the average life expectancy of men with intellectual disabilities is 13 years shorter than that of non-disabled individuals, while for women, it is 20 years shorter.
However, by moving your body and participating in sports competitions at the Special Olympics, you can maintain your health.
Furthermore, the coaching staff will provide guidance on nutrition and health.
At the Special Olympics, free health check-ups are provided for athletes who have difficulty communicating with doctors or have limited access to medical care.
At the 2015 Summer World Championships, my team Canada competed against the basketball team from Nigeria.
On the day before the game, the Nigerian team underwent a health check-up at the venue, with seven out of ten members receiving free hearing aids. Thanks to this, they were able to hear clearly for the first time in their lives.
(Applause) The athletes underwent remarkable transformations.
I was able to enjoy the game more vividly and play with confidence because I could communicate with the coach in person.
Emotions were also running high because they could hear the sound of the ball, as well as the whistle and the cheers of the fans in the stands. These sounds, which are natural to everyone, became audible.
Special Olympics athletes not only during competition but
Life outside the competition venue will also change.
According to the results of a survey conducted this year, nearly half of American adults reportedly do not know anyone with an intellectual disability. These individuals, amounting to 44% of Americans, are said to have very low levels of acceptance towards individuals with disabilities and hold significantly negative views.
Furthermore, the prevalence of the use of discriminatory language is evidence that individuals with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to a significant number of people.
Everyone uses casual expressions and derogatory language.
The number of tweets using the term "retard" last year exceeded 9 million, but it is a word that deeply hurts me and my 4.5 million athlete friends around the world.
Everyone does not realize that it constitutes an insult, but that is a mistake.
My colleague, John Franklin Stevens, a Global Messenger, wrote an open letter addressed to a political commentator who uses derogatory language towards people. "Please come to the Special Olympics someday."
Please try to see if you can leave without being moved in your heart."
(Applause) At this year's 2015 Summer World Championships, people lined up for hours to come and watch the final day of the weightlifting competition.
Among the standing-room-only crowd, my teammate Jackie Barrett, also known as "The Moose of Newfoundland," lifted 297kg in the deadlift and 277kg in the squat - (applause) setting a new personal best record at the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the record holder for weightlifting on Newfoundland Island, not just in the Special Olympics, but among all weightlifters.
In LA, he became a big star, and ESPN tweeted his new record live. They were impressed by Jackie's performance.
Fifty years ago, almost no one thought that individuals with intellectual disabilities could do such things.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremony of the world championships and to cheer on the athletes gathered from 165 countries around the world.
We were not just hidden figures, but received cheers and praise.
The Special Olympics teaches athletes to have confidence and pride.
The people of the world are taught to respect and accept individuals with intellectual disabilities.
(Applause) I now have achievements and dreams in sports, blessed with a wonderful coach, and aiming to become a personal trainer with respect and dignity, healthier than before.
(Applause) I am no longer a hidden or bullied presence. I am here now, giving a TED talk.
(Applause) Thanks to the Special Olympics, the world has changed. But we still have a long way to go.
When you next encounter someone with an intellectual disability, I hope you will see their abilities.
If you see someone using discriminatory language, I hope you will educate them on how hurtful those words can be.
And I hope you will consider getting involved with the Special Olympics.
(Applause) Finally, I will say just one thing.
Nelson Mandela said, "Sports have the power to change the world."
The Special Olympics is truly changing the world. With 4.5 million athletes being reborn, they have a place to gain confidence, make friends, not be judged with prejudice, experience the feeling of being a champion, and actually become champions.
Thank you very much.
