At that time, I was waiting in fear for the last moment of my life in a Texas church filled with souls and bodies.
In a venue exactly like this, I sat shallowly on a broken wooden chair covered with a red rag, with an organ to the left, a choir behind, and baptismal font prepared further back.
There has been no change at all.
The overflowing tension, the earnest desire for salvation, sweaty palms, and the seemingly uninterested individuals sitting at the back.
On the night of December 31, 1999, the night of the Second Coming of Christ, is when I believed the world would end.
That year, I turned exactly 12 years old, which is the age officially recognized as being an adult in the scriptures.
However, even though the world is ending, isn't it unfair? I felt like complaining, but it's too late now. I was forced to reconsider my future.
I changed my heart and visited the church as much as possible.
I earnestly offered prayers to the point of forgetting the passage of time, desperately hoping that God would not hasten His coming due to my lack of faith.
To be extra cautious, I diligently read books that were popular at the time, such as "Please save me."
At one point, I found in the text the phrase "the time of destiny," warning that if one's faith is lacking, further tragedy awaits.
Anyway, the challenge imposed on me is to control all desires, overcome demons and inertia, and triumph over my own lack of faith.
Believe that you can do it, even at the difficult age of 12.
The time is finally approaching.
11:50 PM
With 10 minutes left, the pastor gathered us in front of the altar to await the moment when the clock's hands would point to the time of destiny, with deep prayers.
People from all denominations gather together.
The choir remained in their seats, while the deacons and their wives - so to speak, the bourgeois church members - took their positions at the front row of the altar.
As you know, even for the Second Coming of Christ in America, VIP seats are prepared.
(Applause) Directly behind those VIPs are the elderly individuals who worked in the cotton fields under the blazing sun of East Texas. I think of their backs in their youthful days as they continued to work. Their sun-kissed, unwrinkled skin is like the earth itself. They are people whose expectations have been repeatedly betrayed, holding onto dreams of walking a different path in life. That is who they are.
They are indeed the main characters for me.
They have dedicated their entire lives to this moment, finding purpose in a talk show that starts every day at 4 o'clock, just as the medieval ancestors eagerly awaited the arrival of the last day.
Just like my grandmother, she also heads towards the altar. I quietly followed her back, convinced that my grandmother will definitely go to heaven.
During the prayer, I was thinking that if I held her hand, maybe we could go to heaven together.
I held her hand, closed my eyes, listened intently, and prayed.
The pastor's voice was rough.
The prayer in response became a cry and resounded throughout the church.
The melody of the keyboard increased in momentum.
The heat accompanying it envelops the church.
I grip my grandmother's hand once again so as not to be left behind.
Faced with the terror of destiny, I escaped into the darkness behind my closed eyelids.
And that voice pours down, "Amen."
It's over.
The hands of the clock
The time of destiny has already passed.
The savior did not appear, and I gazed at them, closing my eyes too deeply and for too long to even notice the new possibilities, trying not to realize their disappointment as their eyes swam.
I felt a pain in my chest at the sight of them.
They had been deceived. They were victims of deception, and I was one of them.
I have been praying continuously, making efforts to not succumb to temptation.
I am someone who experienced the baptism of that trial twice, not just once, but twice, and I believed.
Until that moment, for sure.
When I got home and turned on the TV, Peter Jennings was celebrating the dawn of the new century, and that news was being broadcasted worldwide.
At that moment, a strange thought crosses my mind: Does God come down multiple times, taking into account time zones?
This inspiration was too absurd and cruel.
However, even so, I did not stop believing.
And I embrace a new faith - a belief that there is not just one answer.
My answer was wrong. The problem itself was wrong. It is a belief in facing that absurdity.
A new sunlight shines into the frozen, motionless winter mountain called "faith," and the snowmelt water of possibility has begun to flow towards unseen scenery.
I still look back on the night when the savior did not come, even now, in an instant, the moment when what I believed in crumbled, even if it was not a lie, the moment I realized it was not the truth.
Among the many people who celebrated the moment of the year 2000 in a completely different way, there may be those who ended up here after following a similar course to what I experienced. Starting from the dawn of the new century, my mother left, my father lost contact, and even God rejected me from that day.
I reached out my hand to grasp something I could believe in, this time for sure.
At the age of 18, I entered Yale University. It was a perfect opportunity to break away from all the dark past of shattered dreams and lost hopes that I witnessed in Oak Cliff, Texas at the time.
But one day during winter break, while lying face down on the floor at home, with both hands tightly bound behind my back, a robber had a gun pointed at my head. It was then that I finally realized that even education wouldn't save me.
In 2008, I reached out for the next salvation. It was Lehman Brothers.
With a bright future ahead, I quickly make a call home, knowing that we won't struggle financially anymore.
However, even at the heart of that financial system, it collapsed with a loud noise right in front of me, leaving me abandoned even in business.
I will not give up and reach out for the next hope as a youth staff in Washington. The voices coming from Illinois are loudly proclaiming, "The time has come" and "Change will come to America."
However, the Congress failed, the nation rather tore apart hope, and "change" became a grim joke. Even with the political comeback, nothing happened. We were not saved.
I was named the American Dream, and I certainly pledged loyalty at that altar, kneeling to the god of capitalism for success, wealth, and power.
Nevertheless, at the moment when the date changes, I keep my eyes open, wondering if God really did not exist.
That night, I decided to face it once again, not out of bravery, but because I had no choice left but to either die or believe in it, just those two options.
And I proceeded to the next sacred place, Harvard Business School. I did not settle for the appealing offer of salvation at that time because I knew better.
Effort is still not enough.
It was on a night not long after the harsh winter of Cambridge had begun, in a corner of the party that wasn't very lively, that a topic arose among three friends. It was a common topic due to youth that anyone young has experienced at least once: "Shall we go on a journey?"
There was no decision on where to go or how to go.
However, I was obsessed with Jack Kerouac's novel, "On the Road," so we set off to find out what was happening in this country.
Of course, there were many opposing voices, and above all, those voices were very reasonable, but nevertheless, I took a step forward.
In the summer of 2013, an 8000-mile journey around America began. Passing through the grasslands of Montana, the ruins of Detroit, and the swamps of New Orleans, doing business to support the lives of the people they met along the way, their daily lives unfolded.
To me, who was trained at the highest school of capitalism, it was rather innovative.
This idea grew and transformed into an NPO organization called "MBAs Across America," which is what put me on the TED stage, all thanks to that wave.
How greedy our generation is for purpose and meaning.
We noticed the signs of that wave, creating employment and leading change in unnoticed places. Those numerous entrepreneurs need just a little more support.
We finally realized, and to be honest, another important point is that I also made efforts to create a wave.
Each crumbling wound of this country can be healed and comforted, and each social enterprise can help it stand up again. There was indeed a time when many people believed in such a thought, hoping that more and more individuals would think the same.
However, this missionary journey led me to a new gospel, and that is exactly the reason why I stand here today.
It was about a year ago, during one evening, I was at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. It was a gathering of Harvard Business School alumni.
Under the life-size replica of a whale suspended from the ceiling, they sat with the rising stars of the era, praising each other's achievements as alumni and spirit of social contribution.
The network of people gathered there, and their assets, created a proud space overflowing with easily over $500 billion.
When we look at the results we have achieved, each one is beautiful.
But it didn't end there. Two days later, I had business in the Harlem district. I sat in a corner of a farm built on what used to be an empty lot, listening to stories of children who come to the farm every day from a man named Tony.
It is a story of children living below the poverty line.
Even when they sleep, they hold onto their belongings in order to prevent them from being stolen at the homeless shelter.
Children come seeking a meal once a day to Tony's program named "Harlem Grown."
After 20 years as a taxi driver, Tony began to dismantle his pension and started that program.
He does not receive a salary because he was struggling with funding as the activities expanded.
"He said he was determined to cling to any straw."
And I have decided to become that straw.
On the way home, a dull sound echoed in the depths of my chest, and tears just flowed.
I was so ignorant. Under one roof, a replica of a whale floated as people who move 500 billion dollars gathered. Two days later, under the sky a mere 50 blocks north, a man was running around unpaid to prepare meals for children.
I did not shed tears for inequality, nor out of pity for hunger or homeless children, nor out of anger towards the wealth held by the 1%, nor out of sympathy for the poverty of the 99%.
I was simply shaken, faced with the fact that I, a person from a country with kidney disease, am the one on the dialysis machine.
I realized that my story exists for those who must continue walking even if they do not have shoes. To deliver effective assistance to overlooked areas such as Harlem, Appalachia, and the disaster areas of New Orleans, my organization and my voice were needed. It was for all the voiceless voices that have been considered uneducated and innocent.
That revelation completely embarrassed me and reminded me of the absurdity that was repeated over and over again, deceived and betrayed by the new century announced by Peter Jennings.
I was deceived.
But this time, I myself was the false savior. That night, on that altar where I believed the world would end, I took a long detour. I thought that suffering was the atonement to God, that God's word was everything, and that the scriptures were the truth.
After believing in that world, I am now standing at the starting point again after a long journey.
The era we live in now is not an age of disbelief. On the contrary, we believe just as much as in the past.
Some people may believe in the words of Brené Brown. It could be Tony Robbins.
"The New Yorker" and "Harvard Business Review"
There are surely people who believe in them. Above all, right now, at the church called TED, aren't we offering prayers? We want to believe. Believing is necessary.
We ourselves are wishing for a leader who can solve all challenges.
I believe that suffering is the necessary evil in the capitalist god, and I am convinced that the scripture of technological advancement is absolute.
However, when one is too afraid of the foundation of their beliefs being shaken, and neglects to doubt each element of that foundation, the human sacrifices that arise from it are overlooked.
If there is something inevitable that is hindering you, it is time to stop and reconsider.
Creativity, innovation, and the gospel that sings responsibility to society, the environment, and the economy are not within my domain.
In fact, I'm not trying to spread any doctrinal gospel here.
The existence of the gospel of doubt is why I am here.
This gospel is not telling you to stop believing, it simply seeks a new attitude. It is the mindset that there is not just one answer.
Accepting the mistakes made so far, acknowledging that the question itself is wrong, leaving room to recognize that absurdity.
This gospel of doubt suggests the possibility that everything is wrong in this place, in this space where we are.
"Why" is the gospel itself.
Where is the need for people to suffer in vain, to the point of abandoning the power given to us to question?
From this belief in questioning, I made a decision regarding my own activities. "MBAs Across America" was turned into a non-profit organization.
We reduced the organization's staff, stopped new hires, and made our business model publicly available and shareable so that those in need could freely access it.
The questioning of "why" requested of me was to abandon the role of savior imposed on me by people. Faced with the truth that miracles do not happen, and that waiting once again for the Second Coming of Christ is too short for our lives.
This gospel of doubt, even in times of despair when it seems there is no way out, should encourage you, give you hope, and light the way ahead. Even in times of pain and suffering, do not drown in blind faith and thoughtless acceptance - instead, listen to that inner voice that dares to question, as it becomes a faint but invaluable light that illuminates the darkness. Whether it be a whisper or not.
Let it be a scream, simply put it into words, "There must be another way."
Thank you.
