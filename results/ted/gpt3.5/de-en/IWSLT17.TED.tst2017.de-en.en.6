Some time ago, I tried an experiment.
For a year, I would say "Yes!" to everything I was afraid of.
Regardless of whether it made me nervous, put me in uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say "Yes."
Did I want to speak in public?
No, but yes!
Did I want to be live on television?
No, but yes!
Did I want to start acting?
No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.
And a crazy thing happened: Doing exactly what I was afraid of eliminated my fear.
My fear of public speaking, my social anxiety -- poof, gone.
The power of a word is impressive.
"Saying yes" has changed my life.
"Saying yes" changed me.
But there was a particular yes that deeply changed my life, in an unexpected way. It all started with a question from my youngest.
I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett, and Emerson. And Emerson, the youngest, inexplicably calls everyone "darling",
as if she were a waitress from the South.
"Darling, I need milk for my sippy cup."
She once asked me if I could play with her, as I was just about to leave. And I said, "Yes."
This yes was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family. From then on, I vowed to always play with them whenever they ask me to. No matter what I am doing, or where I am going, I always say yes - every single time.
Almost. I am not perfect, but I try very hard.
It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.
But it also has a surprising side effect: It was only recently that I fully understood that saying "Yes" to playing with my children saved my career.
I have a real dream job.
I am an author. I imagine things, bring them to life.
Dream job.
No.
I am a titan.
Dream job.
I create television. I produce television.
I make television, on a large scale.
This TV season, I am responsible for broadcasting 70 hours of programming to the world.
Four television programs, 70 hours of television. Three to four shows are in production simultaneously.
Each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.
The budget for an episode of a television show can range between three and six million dollars.
Let's say five.
A new episode every nine days times four shows, so every nine days $20 million worth of television, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production simultaneously, times four, 16 episodes at the same time: 24 episodes: Grey's, 21 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: How To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: The Catch, 70 hours of television,
350 million dollars for one season.
In America, my TV series air consecutively on Thursday evenings.
My series air worldwide in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.
My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are shows that I have created myself, not just produced, so on top of that. I need to find time, truly quiet, creative time, to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.
Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows in production at the same time, 350 million dollars, campfires burning around the world.
Do you know who still does that?
No one, that's why I am a titan.
Dream job.
I don't want to impress you with that.
I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" is mentioned.
I say this to you so that all of you, who work so hard, whether you are leading a company, a country, or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously when I talk about work, so that you understand that I am not just typing away on the computer and fantasizing, and it is true when I say: I understand that a dream job is not about dreaming.
It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.
I work a lot, hard, and I love it.
When I am immersed in work, there is no other feeling.
My work always creates a country out of nothing.
It's like I'm deploying troops, like I'm painting on a canvas.
It's like hitting a high note, running a marathon.
You feel like Beyonc√©.
And all of this at the same time.
I love to work.
She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and exhilarating, funny and disturbing, clinical and maternal, cruel and rational. And the best part about it is the buzzing.
There is such a change in me when work is going well.
A buzzing starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could drive on it forever.
Many people assume that when I explain the buzzing to them, I am talking about writing, that writing brings me joy.
Don't get me wrong, she does.
But the buzzing - when I started with television production, when I began to work and work and create, to build, to create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this buzzing, this energy. The buzzing!
The buzzing is more than writing.
The buzzing is action and activity. The buzzing is a drug.
The buzzing is music. The buzzing is light and air.
The buzzing is God's voice in my ear.
And when you have such a buzzing, you cannot help but strive for greatness.
The feeling of not being able to do anything else but strive for greatness, no matter the cost.
That's what you call the buzzing.
Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.
Perhaps it's called genius.
Perhaps it's called ego.
Perhaps it's the fear of failure.
I don't know.
I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the buzzing.
I just want to tell you, I am a titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.
To make one thing clear: The more successful I become, the more shows, the more episodes, the more boundaries overcome, the more work there is, the more things at the same time, the more people watching me, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.
The more I work to be successful, the more work must work on me.
And what did I say about work?
I love work, don't I?
The country I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high note, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing.
I like this buzzing. I love the buzzing.
I need the buzzing. I am the buzzing.
Am I just this buzzing?
And then the buzzing stopped.
Overworked, overstrained, exaggerated, burned out.
The buzzing stopped.
Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single work titan.
Harper tells people, "My mom won't be there, but you can write to my nanny."
And Emerson says, "Sweetheart, I want to go to Shonda-Land."
They are the children of a titan.
They are baby titans.
They were 12, 3, and 1 when the buzzing stopped.
The humming of the engine fell silent.
I no longer loved my work. The engine was off.
The buzzing did not return.
My buzzing was broken.
I did the same things as always: the same titan work, 15-hour days, working weekends, no regrets, not delegating anything, a titan doesn't sleep, doesn't give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever it takes.
But there was no buzzing.
There was silence within me.
Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.
Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect titan.
I was a model titan,
Everything was grey, I simply wasn't having fun anymore.
And that was my life.
Everything I did.
I was the buzzing, and the buzzing was me.
So what does one do when what they do, the work they love, suddenly fades away?
I know, some may think: "Go ahead and cry, stupid author titan."
But you know, you do it, one does, one works, one loves what they do, being a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, being Bill Gates, one simply loves another and that gives you the buzzing, when you know the buzzing, and know how the buzzing feels, when you have known the buzzing before, when the buzzing stops, who are you then?
What are you?
What am I?
Am I still a titan?
When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in the silence?
And then my "Southern waitress" asks me a question.
I'm on my way out, running late, and she says, "Mom, do you want to play?"
And I already want to say no, when two things become clear to me:
First, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me "sweetheart."
She doesn't call anyone "sweetheart" anymore.
When did that happen?
I miss it when I am a titan and mourn my buzzing, and here everything changes before my own eyes.
And so she says, "Mom, do you want to play?"
And I say, "Yes."
There is nothing special about that.
We play and her sisters join in, we laugh a lot, and I read very dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."
Nothing extraordinary.
But it is outstanding because in the loneliness and absence of the buzzing, my pain and panic, I can do nothing but be careful.
I am focused.
I am quiet.
The country I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high note - they no longer exist.
All that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, tender voices, crayons, and the song about letting go, or whatever the girl in "Frozen" lets go of.
Everywhere is peace and simplicity.
The air in this place is so thin that I can hardly breathe.
I can hardly believe that I am breathing.
Playing is the opposite of working.
And I am happy.
Something inside me is coming undone.
A mental door opens and a surge of energy comes in.
And not immediately, but it happens, it happens.
I feel it.
The buzzing is slowly coming back.
Not at full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.
Not the buzzing, but a buzzing.
And now I feel like I know a magical secret.
But let's stick to the matter at hand.
It's love. That's all.
No magic. No secret. Just love.
It is something that we have forgotten.
The buzzing, the work buzzing, the titan buzzing, that is just the substitute.
When I ask you who you are, when I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the help of shows and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I have forgotten what the real buzzing is.
The buzzing is not a force, and it is not specific to work.
It depends on the joy.
The real buzzing depends on love.
The buzzing is the current that comes from the joy of living.
The real buzzing is self-confidence and peace.
The real buzzing ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectations, and the pressure.
The real buzzing is simple and original.
The real buzzing is God's voice in my ear, but maybe God whispered the wrong words to me, because which God told me that I am a Titan?
It's simply love.
We all need a bit more love, much more love.
As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.
I make this a firm rule so that I can absolve myself of any guilt as a workaholic.
It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the buzzing again.
I wish it were that simple. I'm not good at playing, I don't like it.
Playing is not even remotely as natural to me as working.
The truth hurts,
but I don't like playing.
I always work because I love it.
I prefer being at the workplace rather than at home.
This admission is painful, because what kind of person prefers working over being at home?
Well, I.
Let's be honest, I call myself a "Titan" --
I must have issues.
That I am too relaxed is none of them.
We race around in the garden, back and forth, here and there.
We have little dance parties,
we sing and play ball.
We pop soap bubbles.
In the process, I mostly feel stiff, absent, and confused.
I always reach for my phone.
But it's okay.
My children show me how to live, and the buzzing of the universe fills me.
I play and play until I ask myself: Why did we ever stop playing?
You can do it too! Say yes whenever your child wants to play with you.
You might consider me naive, a daydreamer.
You are probably right, but you can do it too!
You have time!
And do you know why? You are not Rihanna or a Muppet Show character.
Your child finds you less interesting than you think.
It's only 15 minutes.
My little ones only want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they realize they want to do something else.
They are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, I am replaced by a ladybug or cookie.
And if my teenage daughter talks to me for a whole 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year.
It's only 15 minutes, nothing more is needed.
Everyone can muster 15 minutes in a row, even on a bad mood day!
15 minutes in a row!
No phone, no laundry, no distractions.
The day is short: dinner, getting the children ready for bed.
But 15 minutes are possible!
My children are my oasis of well-being, my world. It doesn't have to be the children. It's about feeling the buzzing, having a place for your peace of mind.
It's not about playing with your own children. It's about joy,
about "playing" in general.
Give yourself the 15 minutes!
Find out what is good for you.
Find it out and keep it.
I am not perfect at it. I fail and I succeed. Meeting friends, reading books, enjoying the day --
"Do you want to play?" stands shortly for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show, when I became a Titan in training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more.
15 minutes in a row, why not treat yourself to the full 15 minutes?
What could be wrong with that? Nothing!
The buzzing returned in my free time. The buzzing seems to return when I am not working.
Working doesn't function without playing.
It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens, energy flows in, and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unfamiliar melody, it fills me and my soul. It inspires me to new ideas. The buzzing has found its way back. I embrace it fully and love my work again.
I like the buzzing, but I don't love it.
I don't need it.
I am not the buzzing, the buzzing is not me ... not anymore.
Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.
This is now my buzzing.
The buzzing of life.
The buzzing of love.
The buzzing of work is part of me, but just a part. And for that, I am so grateful.
I don't care that I'm a Titan. I have never seen a Titan playing musical chairs.
I said yes to less work and more play.
And yet, I have everything under control. My brain is still functional. My campfires are still burning.
The more I play, the happier me and my children are.
The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.
The more I play, the clearer my mind is.
The more I play, the better I work.
The more I play, the more I hear the buzzing. The land I create, the marathon I run, the troops, the canvases, the high pitch, the buzzing, the buzzing, the other, the right buzzing: The buzzing of life.
The more I feel this buzzing, the more this unusual, vibrating, naked, and new sense of life spreads within me. Less Titan - more me!
The more I feel this buzzing exactly, the more I know who I am.
I am an author. I imagine things, I bring them to life.
That's part of the job, that means living your dream.
That is the dream of this job,
because a dream job should be a bit dreamy.
I said "Yes" to less work and more play.
Titans don't stand a chance here.
"Do you want to play?"
Thank you very much.
