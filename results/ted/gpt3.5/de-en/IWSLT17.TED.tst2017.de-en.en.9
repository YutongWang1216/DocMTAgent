Most people have never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.
Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.
This goes back to the decision Roy made three years ago.
Roy Price is a senior executive at Amazon Studios,
the TV production company of Amazon.
He is 47 years old, slim, has a spiky haircut and describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos".
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce.
Of course, this is a very fiercely competitive industry.
There are already so many TV series that Roy cannot just choose any one.
He has to find shows that are very, very good.
In other words, he has to find shows that are located all the way to the right on this curve.
This curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the website IMDB. The rating ranges from 1 to 10 and the height indicates how many shows received that rating.
If your show is rated nine or higher, it is a winner.
Then you have a successful show.
These are shows like "Breaking Bad", "Game of Thrones", "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where after watching one season, your brain asks: "Where can I find more of these episodes?"
This type of show.
On the left side, here at this end, are shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- that should give you enough of an idea of what's going on at this end of the curve.
Roy Price doesn't worry about ending up on the left side of the curve, because I believe you need a special kind of intelligence to outdo "Toddlers and Tiaras."
He is more concerned about the average bulge, the average television - the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't excite.
So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.
The pressure is present, and of course, it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something like this, so Roy Price does not want to take any risks.
He wants to create successes.
He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.
He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where everyone can watch them for free.
And when Amazon gives things away for free, one would definitely take advantage, right?
Millions of viewers watch these episodes.
However, they do not know that they are being watched while watching these shows.
They are being watched by Roy and his team, who record everything.
They capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or watch again.
They collect millions of data in order to decide which show they should produce with this data.
In fact, they collect the data, process it, and the result is the answer, which is: "Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican US senators."
They made this show.
Does anyone know the name of this show?
Yes, "Alpha House", but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good.
It's just an average show - in the truest sense of the word - as the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 - so slightly above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team were aiming for.
Around the same time, at another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. His name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the programming manager at Netflix. Just like Roy, he is always on the lookout to find that one super show, and he also uses data for it, but he does it slightly differently.
Instead of organizing a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on Netflix viewers, such as the ratings they give to shows, their viewing habits, which shows they like, etc.
They then use this data to find out these small details about the viewers: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.
When they had all the pieces together, they took a risk and decided not to make a sitcom about four senators, but instead to make a drama series about one senator.
Do you know this show?
Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.
"House of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. So right where they wanted to be.
Of course, the question now is: What has happened here?
There are two very competitive, data-savvy companies.
They connect all these data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.
What is the reason for this?
Because the logic somehow states that this should work with everything.
When you collect millions of data for a decision you make, you should be able to make a good decision.
There are 200 years of statistics as a back-up.
It is optimized by very powerful computers.
The least one can expect is good television, right?
If data analysis doesn't work like this, then this is somewhat alarming because we live in a time where we increasingly rely on statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.
Does anyone here know the company Multi-Health Systems?
No one. Okay, that's actually good.
Multi-Health Systems is a software company, and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. If you come into contact with it, you will be in prison.
If someone here in the USA is in prison and requests release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company will be used to determine whether a release occurs or not.
Just like with Amazon and Netflix. But instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.
Mediocre television, 22 minutes, that can really be bad, but even more years in prison are worse.
Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the abundance of data,
not always produce the best results. This is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.
Even the most data-savvy companies can be wrong sometimes.
Yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes.
In 2009, Google announced that they can predict outbreaks of the severe type of flu through data analysis of Google searches.
It worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation. The success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature".
It worked perfectly, year after year after year, until it suddenly stopped working.
and no one could say why.
It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the retraction of the publication in the magazine "Nature".
Even the most data-savvy companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.
Despite all these mistakes, data is increasingly flowing into decisions of life - in the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine.
So we should rather ensure that data is helpful.
I also encounter many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics - an area where some very smart people use unimaginable amounts of data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy.
or the development of a medication. Over the years, I have recognized some patterns regarding the difference between successful decisions based on data and unsuccessful decisions. This pattern should be disseminated.
If you ever need to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:
First, you break down this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyze the components; second, you put the individual parts back together to make a decision.
Sometimes you may have to do this multiple times, but it always comes down to two things: breaking apart and putting back together.
And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.
Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help in breaking down a problem and understanding its parts.
They are not suitable for putting the parts back together and then coming to a decision.
There is another tool for that, and we all possess it: our brain.
If there is something that the brain is good at, it is putting parts and pieces back together, even when the information is incomplete, in order to then make a good decision - especially when it is the brain of an expert.
Therefore, I believe Netflix was so successful because they used data and intelligence where they belong in the process.
They use data to better understand their audience, something they wouldn't have been able to do otherwise. But the decision of how to take all these parts, put them back together, and create a show like "House of Cards" was not in the data.
Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.
Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.
They used data to guide all their decisions, first when competing for TV ideas, then when selecting "Alpha House" as a show.
It was a safe decision because they could always say, "The data tells us so."
It did not lead to the desired outcome.
Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.
No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and to not forget that, this device is quite useful.
Many of you will ...
Before there were data, this was the device for decisions.
Many are familiar with it.
It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." It's amazing. For decisions using a yes or no question, all you have to do is shake the ball to get an answer. "Most likely" -- right here in this moment.
I will fight it out later with a technical demo.
I have made some decisions in my life so far, where I should have listened to the ball in hindsight.
But, as you naturally know, when you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, like data analysis, to make better decisions.
But this does not change the basic structure.
So the ball may become smarter and smarter and smarter. Ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.
And I find this to be a very encouraging message, that despite the large amount of data, it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do, and to take risks.
Because in the end, it's not the data, but the risks, that will lead you to the right end of the curve.
Thank you very much.
