1.3 billion years ago, in a very distant galaxy, two black holes were orbiting each other faster and faster, converting the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.
For this brief moment, they shone brighter than all the stars combined in all galaxies of the entire known universe.
It was a very big bang.
But they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we are talking about black holes.
The entire energy was released into the spacetime structure itself, and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.
Let us first order the events chronologically.
1.3 billion years ago, multicellular life had just emerged on Earth.
Since then, Earth has produced quite a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans, and - God help us - even the Internet.
About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous individuals - Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech - decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves generated by colliding black holes.
Most people thought they were crazy.
But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so the US National Science Foundation funded their idea.
After decades of development, construction, design, and an immense amount of hard work, they built the detector LIGO: the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.
Over time, the precision of LIGO could be significantly increased, greatly improving its detection capabilities.
Therefore, it is now called Advanced LIGO.
At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was launched for a final test run to address some minor, persistent issues.
On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the detector was put into operation, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes rushed through the Earth.
They went through you and me.
and also through the detector.
Scott Hughes: Only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:
the birth of my daughter
and saying goodbye to my terminally ill father.
Basically, these were the fruits of my life's work.
All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: This is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, a theoretical physicist at MIT. For 23 years, he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their measurable signals through observatories like LIGO. But what are gravitational waves?
A gravitational wave is a ripple in the fabric of space and time.
As the wave passes by, space and all its contents are stretched in one direction and compressed in the other.
To illustrate, instructors in courses on relativity theory often perform a truly silly dance.
"Stretch and compress, stretch and compress."
The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even laughable.
For example, on September 14, each of us was stretched and compressed when the waves hit. The stretching of an average person was 10 to the power of -21.
That means 20 zeros after the decimal point, followed by a 1. That's why the LIGO employees were declared crazy.
With a five-kilometer long laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured to less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. That is grotesque.
At the end of his classic text on gravitation
Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGO, described the hunt for the waves as follows: "The technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous."
But physicists are inventive, and with the support of the public, all obstacles will surely be overcome.
Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.
Back to LIGO. Scott likes to claim that LIGO is more of an ear than an eye.
I would like to explain what that means.
Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your phone.
That's quite handy. Because in this way, you can create an image or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from multiple points around you.
With sounds, it's different.
Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.
That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible, to create an image of things that mean a lot to you:
such as the face of your child.
Instead, we listen for specific characteristics such as pitch and tone, rhythm and volume, to infer the story behind them.
"Alice is speaking right now."
"And Bob interrupts her."
"Silly Bob."
The same applies to gravitational waves.
We cannot create simple images of objects in space with them.
But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.
At least for LIGO, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.
So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.
Listening to gravity can reveal a lot to us about the collision of two black holes, something my colleague Scott has been studying for a long time.
SH: Two non-rotating black holes simply chirp: wupp!
If the two bodies rotate very quickly, you can hear the same chirping with an additional change in pitch. It sounds like this: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!
It is a kind of vocabulary of movement, imprinted in the waveform.
AA: On September 14, 2015 - a date that at least I will never forget - LIGO heard the following: [Surrendering noise] Someone who knows what to listen for recognizes this as the sound of - SH: ... two black holes, each with 30 times the mass of the sun, spinning about as fast as the beaters in your mixer.
AA: Let's briefly consider what that means.
Two black holes, the densest bodies in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, orbit each other a hundred times per second before they collide.
Imagine these forces.
Fantastic.
And we know this because we have heard it.
This is the lasting significance of LIGO.
LIGO paves an entirely new path for exploring the universe, as has never been possible before.
In this way, we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.
Many things in space we cannot see -- either practically or fundamentally.
For example, a supernova. I would like to know why massive stars explode in supernovae.
They are very useful. We have learned a lot about the universe from them.
The exciting physical processes, however, occur in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon, and silicon.
We will never see through them, as they are opaque.
Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. The Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them, as the Big Bang is obscured by its own afterglow.
With the help of gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.
And perhaps most importantly, I am optimistic that there are things in the universe that we have never seen before, that we may never see, and of which we have no concept. Things that we can only discover by listening.
In fact, LIGO found things right from the start that we had not expected.
My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says on this topic: ME: The type of stars that produce black holes, as observed by LIGO, are the dinosaurs of the universe.
They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. The black holes are, so to speak, the dinosaur bones for our archaeological work.
LIGO allows us a completely different perspective on the events in space, on the formation of stars, and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos.
AA: The challenge now is to be as brave as possible.
Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.
We need ideas for new observatories - a completely new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.
For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?
Now is the time for big dreams.
Dream with us.
Thank you.
