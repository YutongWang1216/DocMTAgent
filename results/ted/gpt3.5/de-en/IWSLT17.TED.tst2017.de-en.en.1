On April 3, 2016, the largest data leak in history was released. The "Panama Papers" reveal that the wealthy and powerful have hidden enormous sums of money in tax havens. What does this mean? We asked Robert Palmer from Global Witness for an explanation. This week, we were hit with news of a leak of 11 million documents from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.
The publication of these documents gives a small glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.
We get an impression of how clients, banks, and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say, "Okay, we need an anonymous company. Can you set that up?"
We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, how it operates.
This has already led to some very direct consequences.
The Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned.
There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailbox companies in tax havens.
It is claimed that a trail of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, through a close childhood friend, a famous cellist.
Now there will be a lot of wealthy people and others out there who are nervously waiting for the next publication, and for the next revealed documents.
Now that sounds like the plot of a spy thriller or a John Grisham novel.
It seems far away from you, me, ordinary people.
Why should that concern us?
But the truth is: If the wealthy and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services like healthcare, education, and roads.
And this concerns all of us.
For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.
Around the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by a few to hide and obscure their wealth - something we have been discussing and exposing for ten years.
I think many people find this whole world very confusing, and it is difficult to understand how these tax havens operate.
I always imagine it like a Matryoshka doll.
So you have a company within another company, within another company, making it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these structures.
It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society, to truly understand what is going on.
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA.
Probably because there have been no prominent Americans involved in these revelations, this scandal.
Now it's not the case that there are no wealthy Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens.
However, due to the principle on which these tax havens operate, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American clients.
If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming, or Nevada, we would see many more cases and examples with connections to the USA.
In fact, it is the case that in some US states, you need less information, less information to provide, to establish a company than to get a library card.
This type of lack of transparency in the USA has allowed employees of school districts to exploit schoolchildren.
It has allowed scammers to exploit particularly vulnerable investors.
It is this type of behavior that concerns all of us.
Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out what all of this looks like in practice.
How does that actually work?
So we sent an undercover investigator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.
Our investigator posed as an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money into the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.
We were truly shocked that all but one lawyer made suggestions to our investigator on how he could transfer his money.
These were all preliminary discussions. None of these lawyers accepted us as clients, and of course, no money was handed over to anyone. But it shows the problem with this system.
It is also important not to consider this as isolated cases.
It's not about a single lawyer who made suggestions to our undercover investigator.
It's not about a single top politician involved in a scandal.
It's about how the system operates, through which corruption, tax evasion, poverty, and instability are established.
And to address this, we need to change the rules of the game.
We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.
This may all sound very gloomy, as if we couldn't do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the wealthy and powerful.
But as a born optimist, I do see that some things have started to change.
In the past few years, we have seen initiatives towards more transparency regarding the owners of companies.
The topic gained political attention from British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.
Since then, the EU has been capturing in central registers at the national level who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them.
One of the uncomfortable facts is that the USA is lagging behind in this regard.
Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both chambers of parliament, but it is not making the progress we would like to see.
We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, are used as a means to promote more transparency in the USA and globally.
For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.
We need ordinary people who get angry when they see how others can hide their true identity behind shell companies.
We need business leaders to stand up and say, "Lack of transparency is not good for business."
We need political leaders who recognize the problem and are committed to ending this type of lack of transparency through laws.
Together, we can finally end the lack of transparency that currently enables this type of tax evasion, corruption, and money laundering.
