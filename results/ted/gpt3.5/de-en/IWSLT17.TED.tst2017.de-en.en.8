Democracy.
We in the West make a big mistake in taking them for granted.
We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it really is, but as inventory of our society.
We tend to see them as an unchangeable given.
We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.
That's not true.
Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his major imitators in Beijing have undoubtedly proven that it is indeed possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while the politics remain completely undemocratic.
In fact, democracy is fading away here, in Europe.
At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece - the newly elected Greek government - as Finance Minister in the Eurogroup, it was made unmistakably clear to me that the democratic process of our country - our elections - should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece.
At that moment, I thought that there could probably be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it changed anything.
At this point, I would like to present to you an economic model for a true democracy.
I ask you to join me in believing again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup are mistaken in thinking that we can save democracy, but that we need a true and robust democracy.
Because without democracy, our societies become meaner, our future darker, and our great new technologies wasted.
Regarding waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.
I call it the "Twin Summit Paradox".
You are familiar with a summit. You know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe, and the whole world.
We all recognize the mountain of debt,
but only a few recognize its twin.
A mountain of unused cash, owned by wealthy savers and corporations who are too afraid to invest it where it would be productive and could generate income to pay off the mountain of debt and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, such as "green" energy.
I will give you two numbers for that.
In the past 3 months, a total of 3.4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the USA, England, and the Eurozone in all the wealth-producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, rails, equipment, and so on and so forth.
3.4 trillion US dollars may sound like a lot of money, until you compare it to the 5.1 trillion US dollars that were sitting idle in the same countries and our financial institutions at the same time, doing absolutely nothing except inflating the stock markets and driving up real estate prices.
Debts and unproductive capital form the twin summits that are not balanced by the usual market mechanisms.
The result is stagnant wages, with more than a quarter of 25-54 year olds in the USA, Japan, and Europe unemployed, leading to low overall economic demand that, like a vicious cycle, reinforces investor pessimism. Fearing low demand, investors themselves exacerbate it by not investing. Just like Oedipus' father, who, fearing the prophecy of the oracle that his son would kill him when he grows up,
unintentionally brings about the circumstances that lead to Oedipus killing him.
This is my struggle with capitalism --
his extremely wasteful nature. All that unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially finance all the technologies, "green" technologies, which are crucial for saving the Earth.
So is democracy the solution?
I believe so. But before we continue: What do we understand by democracy?
Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor, as the majority, control the government.
The Athenian democracy naturally excluded too many people --
Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.
However, it would be a mistake to diminish the importance of Athenian democracy due to these exclusions.
The crucial aspect of Athenian democracy was and is that it included the working poor, not only granting them the right to free speech, but more importantly and significantly, it granted them the right to political participation with equal voting weight on matters of state affairs.
Although Athenian democracy did not last long --
like a candle that burns very brightly, it is also quickly extinguished.
However, our modern liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,
but in the Magna Carta, in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.
While Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and empowered the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately served as a charter for rulers.
Because liberal democracy only emerged when a complete separation of politics and economics became possible and the democratic process was limited to politics, while the economy - that is, the world of corporations - became a democracy-free zone.
In our current democracies, since the point at which this separation of politics and economics began, there has been an relentless struggle between the two, with the economy gradually infiltrating and disempowering politics.
Wondering why politicians are not like they used to be anymore?
It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.
It is because nowadays one can be in government and still not have power, because power has shifted from politics to the economy and the domains are separated.
I mentioned my struggle with capitalism.
When you think about it, it's somewhat like a pack of predators that has so sustainably decimated the animals it feeds on that it ultimately starves as a result.
Similarly, it is with the economy, which has cannibalized politics to such an extent that it harms itself through the self-inflicted economic crisis. The power of corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, inequality is rising, overall economic demand is falling, and corporate executives are too afraid to invest their companies' cash.
The more successful capitalism drives the "Demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks will rise, and the greater the waste of human labor and the wealth of humanity.
If this is true, it is clear that we need to reunite politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "Demos" retains control, as in ancient Athens, except for the exclusion of slaves, women, and foreigners.
By the way, this is not a new idea.
The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it didn't turn out particularly well.
The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position like in ancient Athens through a miracle, without creating new forms of brutality and waste.
But there is a solution: Abolish the working poor!
Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.
The problem is that as long as the economy and politics are separate spheres, automation will make the twin summits higher, waste more sublime, and social conflicts deeper, as it will happen -- very soon, I believe -- in countries like China.
So we must reshape the economy and reunite the spheres of economy and politics, ensuring that we democratize the reunited sphere, or else we will end up in a pathological surveillance hyper-autocracy that makes the movie "Matrix" appear like a documentary.
So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements it has brought forth --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism will be replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "Matrix", or by something resembling society in "Star Trek", where machines serve humans and humans invest their energy in exploring the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian "Agora", indulging in long conversations about the meaning of life.
I believe we are allowed to be optimistic.
So what would it take, what could it look like, to have this "Star Trek"-like utopia instead of the "Matrix"-like dystopia?
In practical implementation, I would like to briefly give you some examples.
In the realm of companies: Please imagine a capital market where you earn money while working, and where your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to another, and the company - no matter where you are currently employed - is owned by those who are currently working in the company.
Then all incomes come from capital and profits, and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated.
No more distinction between those who own the companies but do not work in them, and employees who work there but do not own the company. No more tug-of-war between capital and labor, no major gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no towering twin peaks.
In the realm of global political economy: Please imagine briefly that our national currencies had a freely floating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging economies], in the interest of all humanity.
Furthermore, imagine that all world trade is conducted in this currency - let's call it "the Cosmos", in units of "Cosmos" - and each government pays into a common fund the amount corresponding to the trade deficit or surplus of the respective country.
Also imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment resources are scarce.
This is not a new idea.
It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.
The problem was that at that time, they did not have the technical means to implement it.
Today we have it, especially against the backdrop of a reunited politics and economy.
The world I am describing to you is simultaneously libertarian, as it favors privileged individuals, and Marxist, as it will bury the separation of capital and labor in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian.
But above all else, it is a world in which we can envision a true democracy.
Will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a "Matrix"-like dystopia?
The answer depends on how we collectively decide politically.
It is in our hands, and we better do it democratically.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Yanis ...
You describe yourself in your biography as a libertarian Marxist.
How relevant is Marx's analysis today?
Yanis Varoufakis: If anything of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.
The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is ... If we do not do this, technological development will lead to a massive decline in overall economic demand, which Larry Summers refers to as "secular stagnation."
By transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also those countries with little interest in liberal democracy.
If this analysis is correct, then Marx is indeed relevant.
just like Hayek, that's why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, that's why I am completely confused.
BG: Actually, and now we probably are.
YV: If you're not confused, you're not thinking enough.
BG: That's a very Greek, kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: Actually, it was Einstein who said that. BG: In your speech, you mentioned Singapore and China, and yesterday at the speaker's dinner, you clearly stated your views on China from the perspective of the West.
Would you like to repeat it here?
YV: There is a great deal of hypocrisy.
In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.
As I mentioned in my speech, we have confined democracy to politics, while the area where most things happen - the realm of the economy - is a completely democracy-free zone.
In a certain sense, if I may say so provocatively, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.
Because - remember - we tend to associate liberalism with democracy - that is a mistake, historically speaking.
Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly skeptical regarding the democratic development.
What can be observed in China now closely resembles the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.
Accusing China now of doing what the West did in the 19th century itself reeks strongly of hypocrisy.
BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.
YV: I had a feeling that was coming.
BG: Yes...
How do you look back on the first half of the year six months later?
YV: Very exciting, from a personal perspective, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a fresh start with the Eurozone,
not only Greece, but the Eurozone,
namely to bid farewell to our self-satisfaction, and the constant denial that a massive fault line ran through, and continues to run through, the Eurozone, which massively threatens the development of the entire European Union.
We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal - which, by the way, was the first proposal that revealed this denial -
to do it right. Unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the Eurogroup, have continued to choose denial.
But you know what's coming.
That is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to keep an economic system that is not viable alive through political will and authoritarianism, one may be able to delay it for a while, but when the change finally comes, it happens abruptly and destructively.
BG: What change do you foresee?
YV: There is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.
BG: Have you made any mistakes during your time as Finance Minister?
YV: Every day.
BG: For example? YV: Anyone who looks back -- Seriously...
If there is a Finance Minister, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims that he has made no mistakes, then that is a dangerous person.
Of course, I have made mistakes.
The biggest mistake was signing the request to extend the debt program at the end of February.
I believed that there was a sincere interest on the part of the creditors to find a common solution.
But that was not the case.
They simply wanted to bring down our government because they did not want to deal with the disruptions caused by the Eurozone.
They did not want to admit that they had been implementing a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.
We lost a third of our nominal GDP.
It's worse than during the "Great Depression".
None of the Troika of lenders who imposed this policy on us admitted: "That was a colossal mistake."
BG: Despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the conversations, you still seem quite pro-European.
YV: Absolutely.
My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.
My biggest fear is that the Eurozone will not survive.
Because if it does not survive, the unleashed centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.
This will not only have catastrophic consequences for Europe, but for the entire global economy.
We are probably the strongest economy in the world.
If we allow ourselves to go down the path of a postmodern 1930s, as it seems to me, it will be just as detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.
BG: We very much hope that you are wrong on this point.
Yanis, thank you very much for being at TED.
YV: Thank you.
