I am a neurosurgeon.
Like most of my colleagues, I deal with human tragedies every day.
I know how your life can change from one second to the next, after a severe stroke or a car accident.
For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other organs, has a very limited ability to heal itself.
After a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.
That is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.
What is a functional neurosurgeon?
A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical measures.
Surely you have heard of one of the most well-known ones, the "deep brain stimulation". In this procedure, an electrode is implanted deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function improves.
It is truly an amazing technology. It has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's who suffered from severe tremors and intense pain.
However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro healing.
The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.
In my opinion, we are approaching this dream.
I want to show you that we are very close.
With some help, the brain can help itself.
The story began 15 years ago.
At that time, I was the chief senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.
I often treated patients with traumatic brain injury.
You have to imagine that in traumatic brain injuries, the brain swells and the intracranial pressure increases.
To save a life, one must reduce intracranial pressure.
For this, sometimes one must remove a portion of swollen brain tissue.
Instead of discarding the swollen brain tissue, we decided with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, to analyze the brain tissue.
What do I mean by that?
We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.
This is not an easy task.
Growing cells from a piece of tissue is comparable to very young children being taken away from their families.
One must find the right nutrition, temperature, humidity, and environments to allow them to thrive.
That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.
After many attempts, Jean-François succeeded.
He saw that under his microscope.
That was a big surprise for us.
Why?
It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. With large green cells surrounded by small, immature cells.
You may remember from biology class that stem cells are immature cells that can transform into any cell type in the organism.
The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. They are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.
It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room.
We made another fascinating observation: Normal stem cells are very active - they divide very rapidly.
They never die, they are immortal.
But these cells behaved differently.
They divided slowly and even died after a few weeks.
So we saw a new, strange population of cells that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.
It took us a long time to understand where they came from.
They originate from these cells.
These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.
We all have them in our brain.
They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.
They play a very important role in our development.
In the fetal stage, they are responsible for the folding of the brain.
But why do they remain with us?
We don't know.
We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries.
However, that is not so certain.
One thing, however, is clear - we obtained our stem cells from these cells.
We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.
We had to prove that.
So we decided to develop an experiment.
We wanted to extract a piece of brain tissue from the non-verbal area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.
and then color-code them to be able to track them in the brain.
In the final step, we reimplanted them at the extraction site of the same individual.
We call this autologous transplantation - autotransplantation.
One of our initial questions was: What happens when we reimplant these cells into normal brain tissue? And what will happen when we reimplant the same cells into damaged brain tissue?
Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.
In the first scenario, we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they completely disappeared, as if they had been removed again, they go back home. The space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.
In the second scenario, we added an injury and reimplanted exactly the same cells, and now the cells remained - they grew into mature neurons.
Here you can see what we were able to observe under the microscope.
These are the cells that were reimplanted.
The evidence they show are these small dots. These are the cells that we stained in vitro, in culture.
Of course, we could not stop here.
Do these cells also help a monkey recover from a brain injury?
So we trained monkeys on a manual dexterity task.
They had to take food pellets from a tray.
They did that very well.
Once they had reached a stable level of manual dexterity, we injured the hand motor area in the motor cortex.
As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.
Just like it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent, just like after a stroke.
The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover using plastic brain mechanisms. They recover to a certain extent, just like the monkeys.
Once we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.
On the left side, you can see the monkey who spontaneously recovered.
He can achieve about 40% to 50% of his original performance from before the injury.
He is not as precise and not as fast.
Now, see as we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the reimplantation.
I can tell you, those were very exciting results for us as well.
Since that time, we have discovered a lot more about these cells.
We can freeze them and use them later.
We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.
But our dream is still to implant them in humans.
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain provides us with the means to heal itself.
Thank you very much.
Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, are thinking: "I know someone who could use that."
I definitely will.
Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies in humans.
Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are the authorities. Based on these great results, one must fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies.
BG: That is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.
JB: Yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience, and an almost professional team.
BG: Look into the future - you have completed the research and tried to obtain permission to start the clinical studies. If you look further into the future, how many years will it take for someone to come to the hospital and this therapy to be available.
JB: That is hard to say.
First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.
Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?
Then one must conduct this study with a small group of patients.
It already takes a long time to select the patients, perform the treatments, and evaluate whether it is useful to undergo this type of treatment.
After that, one must apply it to a multicenter study.
One must first truly prove that it is useful before offering this treatment to everyone.
BG: And that it is safe, of course. JB: Of course.
BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and for telling us about it.
BG: Thank you very much.
