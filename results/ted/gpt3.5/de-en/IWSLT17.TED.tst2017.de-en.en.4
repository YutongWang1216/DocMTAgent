What started as a platform for hobbyists is on the verge of becoming a billion-dollar business.
Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film, and journalism: These are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. This is made possible in research institutions worldwide.
Before drone delivery entered our societal consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft built a six-meter high tower made of 1,500 bricks live in front of an audience at the FRAC Centre in France. A few years ago, they started flying with ropes.
By linking together, aircraft achieve high speed and acceleration in a tight space.
They can also autonomously build load-bearing structures.
They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence, and generally respond to the laws of nature.
Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.
Our goal is to push the boundaries of what is possible in autonomous flight.
For a system to function autonomously, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are in space.
In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to locate objects. This then allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.
For today's demos, we are using a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a spin-off of our laboratory.
There are no external cameras.
Each flying machine has internal sensors to determine its position in space, onboard calculations determine what the machine should do.
There are external commands at the highest level, such as "take off" and "land".
This is a so-called tail starter,
an aircraft that tries to kill two birds with one stone.
Like other fixed-wing aircraft, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.
Unlike most fixed-wing aircraft, it can hover, giving it great advantages during takeoff and landing, making it very versatile.
However, there is always a downside.
One limitation of tail rotors is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as gusts of wind.
We are developing new controls and algorithms to improve this.
The idea behind this is that the aircraft can regain the optimal position regardless of its orientation and performance can be improved through practice.
Okay.
During our research, we often pose fundamental abstract questions that delve into the heart of the matter.
One such question would be, for example: What is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?
There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.
Helicopters are known to have about a thousand moving parts that come together to harm you.
Decades ago, trained pilots could fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a tail rotor.
Recently, we discovered that flying with just one works.
This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-controlled aircraft. It was recently invented.
It has only one moving part, a propeller,
no flaps, hinges, and ailerons, no additional actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.
Although it is mechanically simple, a lot happens inside so that it can fly stably and move anywhere in space.
However, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail starter. To get it to fly, I have to throw it just right.
The likelihood of throwing it just right when everyone is watching is low, so I will show you a video that was filmed last night.
If the Monospinner is an exercise in simplicity, this machine here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellers, is an exercise in abundance.
What to do with all this abundance?
You can see that it is extremely symmetrical.
Therefore, he is ambivalent in his orientation.
This gives it the extraordinary ability,
to move in space in all directions, regardless of the direction it is facing or even how it is rotating.
Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive flows from the eight propellers.
Some things can be represented in models, the rest is learned directly while flying.
Let's take a look at this.
If aircraft are to become part of our everyday lives, they must become extremely safe and reliable.
This machine here consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.
This one rotates clockwise
and the other counterclockwise.
When assembled, they behave like a high-performance quadcopter.
However, if something goes wrong - a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery - the machine can still fly, albeit in a limited capacity.
We will now demonstrate this by making one half of it unable to fly.
The final demonstration explores synthetic swarms.
The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.
We took off-the-shelf micro quadcopters - each weighing less than a slice of bread - and equipped them with localization technology and algorithms.
Each unit knows where it is in space and is self-controlled. Therefore, there is no upper limit.
Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to come up with new revolutionary ideas.
The particularly secure machine over there wants to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.
Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.
For guys like us, the reward lies in the development and act of creation.
It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, intelligent beings to shape it in such a spectacular way.
The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.
Thank you very much.
