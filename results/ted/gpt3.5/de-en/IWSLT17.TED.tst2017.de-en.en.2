This is the story of how I almost got kidnapped and ended up in the trunk of a red Mazda.
One day after I had completed my design studies, I held a backyard sale.
A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my things.
He bought one of my artworks.
He was alone in the city and was currently on a road trip through the entire country. After that, he would join the Peace Corps.
I invited him for a beer. He enthusiastically told me how he wanted to change the world.
It got late. I became tired.
While we were paying the bill, I made the mistake of asking him: "Where are you staying tonight?"
He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know yet."
And I thought, "Oh, man!
What do I do now?
Who doesn't know the situation?
Do I have to offer a place to sleep now?
But I just met him! He says he's going to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans to do that. I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazda!
That's a small trunk!
Then I heard myself say, "I have an air mattress. You can sleep in my living room."
A voice in my head said, "Uh, excuse me?"
At night, I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling and thinking, "Oh man! What have I gotten myself into?
A total stranger is sleeping in my living room.
What if he's crazy?
I got so scared that I got out of bed, tiptoed to the door, and locked my bedroom door.
But he wasn't crazy.
We are still in touch.
The artwork he bought from me is now hanging in his classroom. He is now a teacher.
That was my first experience as a host. It completely changed my perspective.
Maybe the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends just waiting to be discovered?
Hosting people on my air mattress became normal for me. When I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with me.
Let's make a time jump, two years later...
I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate is moving out, and the rent is being increased.
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. All hotels were fully booked.
I believe creativity can turn fear into fun.
I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I've been thinking about how we could make some extra money. Our apartment will become a designer bed and breakfast. Young designers can stay with us, with Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and breakfast every morning.
Ha!"
We created a website and thus founded "Luftmatratze und Frühstück" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].
Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on the air mattress on the wooden floor for 20 dollars at our place.
They thought it was great, and so did we.
I'm sure our cheese and ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.
We toured the city with them. When we said goodbye to our last guest and the door closed behind them, Brian and I stared at each other.
Had we just discovered that we could simultaneously make new friends and pay our rent?
Things started rolling.
My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.
We wanted to find out if we could turn it into a business concept.
So we presented ourselves to the investors: "We want to create a website where people can publicly post pictures of their private spaces, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms you close the doors to when guests come over.
Through the internet, they can then invite complete strangers to stay with them.
That will be the next big thing!
We waited for the rocket to ignite.
But it didn't.
No one in their right mind would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in other people's homes.
Why?
Because as children, we all learned that strangers are dangerous.
When you have a problem, you focus on the things you are good at. We could design.
At the art academy, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel - it's the overall experience.
We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.
Can design achieve something like this?
Is it possible to create trust through design?
I would like to give you a taste of the level of trust we were aiming for.
It is a 30-second experiment. It will force you out of your comfort zone.
Thumbs up if you're ready.
Take your phone in your hand.
Now I would like you to unlock your phone.
Pass your unlocked phone to your left seat neighbor.
This slight hint of panic you are feeling now is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.
Because the only thing more personal than your phone is your home.
Visitors can not only read your text messages, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.
How does it feel to hold a stranger's unlocked phone in your hands?
Most feel the responsibility.
Most guests also feel this way when they stay somewhere else.
Our company can only exist for this reason.
Just wondering, who actually has Al Gore's phone now?
Could you please announce on Twitter that he is running for the office of President?
You can now return the phones.
You have now experienced the kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.
What if we had changed a small detail in this experiment?
What if your neighbor had first introduced himself by name; if he had told you where he comes from, what his dog or children are called?
Imagine having 150 reviews, all saying: "He is really good at holding unlocked phones!"
How would you feel if you had to hand over your phone?
Because a well-thought-out feedback system significantly strengthens trust.
In the beginning, we made some mistakes.
It was difficult for people to leave negative reviews.
Ultimately, we decided to wait until both the host and the guest had submitted their reviews before posting them online.
Last week we discovered something new.
We conducted a study with Stanford. We examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are in terms of age and place of residence.
Unsurprisingly, we trust the people most who are most similar to us.
The more differences we find, the less we trust.
This is a natural social bias.
It gets exciting when you add a person's reputation - in our case through reviews.
If you have less than three reviews, nothing changes.
But if you have more than ten, everything changes.
A good reputation stands out from commonalities.
So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.
Furthermore, we learned that trust depends on how much one reveals about themselves.
Here you can see the reactions to the first message from a guest.
If you don't share enough, such as just saying "Hi!", you are less likely to get a response.
If you share too much, such as "I have issues with my mother" -- -- the request is also less likely to be accepted.
So there is an optimal level of openness, for example, "Great artworks in your apartment! I'm on vacation with my family."
How can one achieve this level of openness with design?
We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. We also provide tips on what topics to write about.
Our entire company is built on the hope that the right design can help us overcome our prejudices towards strangers.
What we had not expected was the large number of people who were more than willing to set aside these prejudices.
Here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer.
Three things can be recognized.
First: incredibly lucky.
Secondly: the tireless work of our team.
Third: a need that had not been met before.
Business is going very well for us right now.
Of course, there are also times when not everything goes smoothly.
There were guests who held unauthorized parties or vandalized apartments.
Hosts have left guests standing in the rain.
At the beginning of the project, I worked in customer service. All calls came directly to my mobile phone.
I was at the forefront when trust was broken.
There is nothing worse than these calls. It already hurts just thinking about it.
The disappointment one hears in the voices of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue improving.
Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million arranged overnight stays ever had a problem.
For people rightly trusted each other.
When trust works, wonderful things can happen.
One of our guests was on vacation in Uruguay. There he suffered a heart attack.
His host drove him to the hospital.
He even donated blood for the necessary operation!
Here is his assessment:
"Perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.
The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.
Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save a life, even though they don't really know you.
They drive you to the hospital in their own car if you're dying, and wait while you get a bypass.
Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books over.
They even let you stay longer without charging for the extra nights.
"I can only recommend it!"
Of course, not every stay goes like this.
But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one aims to achieve with the sharing economy.
When I first stumbled upon this term, I wondered:
How does the idea of sharing fit together with money transactions?
This is about an economic trade.
But simply calling it the "rental industry" now does not do the concept justice.
The sharing economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.
People expose a part of themselves, and that changes everything.
When traveling nowadays, it is comparable to fast food. It is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.
However, what if traveling were a rich buffet of local impressions?
What if, at every place you visit, a group of locals were waiting to thoroughly immerse you and show you neighborhoods on a pub crawl that you've never heard of before;
or if one could learn cooking from a five-star chef?
Nowadays, apartments are designed based on the principle of privacy.
What if we designed apartments from the ground up for sharing?
How would that look?
What if cities were to embrace the idea of sharing in common?
I imagine cities that enable us to have society and relationships, instead of loneliness and isolation.
In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already been initiated. Many parking spaces owned by the government,
were now offered to residents. Students who were looking for a place to stay,
were offered to people whose children had moved out. Incubator programs were launched,
to be able to finance new start-ups in the sharing economy. Through our platform alone, tonight 785,000 people in 191 countries will be staying with a stranger or hosting themselves.
So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as we were taught.
We didn't reinvent the wheel.
Hospitality existed before as well.
There were similar websites before us.
So why did ours work?
Apart from luck and timing, we realized that with the components of trust, one can find the right design.
Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.
I find that astonishing,
absolutely overwhelming.
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me.
Of course, we know that design cannot solve every problem.
But if it could help us, if it had such a great impact, I wonder what we can use design for in the future.
Thank you.
