This is James Risen.
You may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.
Long before anyone had ever heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he spectacularly revealed that the NSA illegally tapped phones of Americans.
But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.
In it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed over blueprints for a nuclear bomb to Iran.
If that sounds crazy, read it.
It is an incredible story.
But do you know who didn't like this chapter at all?
The US government.
For almost 10 years, the government investigated Risen and asked him to reveal his alleged sources.
In this process, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblowers and spying on journalists.
According to the First Amendment, the media have the right to publish secret information.
But it is impossible to exercise this right if the media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave individuals who disclose it.
So when the government came knocking on Risen's door, he did something that many courageous reporters before him had done: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.
So from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.
But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.
Suddenly, although they had claimed for years that it was essential for their case, the government's demands on Risen were dropped.
The reason: In the era of electronic surveillance, reporters and sources can hide less and less.
Instead of failing and getting Risen to testify, his digital footprints could do it for him.
And so the investigators, without his consent, secretly obtained his phone records,
just like his email data, financial and bank information, his credit report, and even travel records with a list of his flights.
Amidst this information, they found evidence that they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's alleged source.
Unfortunately, this is just one of many cases.
President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers when he took office. But instead, the Justice Department has convicted more than all US governments before him combined.
Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially since the government classifies too much of their work as secret.
Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.
So we are jeopardizing press work, which should be protected by the First Amendment, because the government has more and more ways to spy on everyone.
But just as technology allows the government to circumvent reporters' rights, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.
And they can do that from the moment they make contact, instead of afterwards, in the witness stand.
Today, there is communication software that did not exist when Risen wrote his book, and it is much more secure than regular emails or phone calls.
One such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source submission system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the internet celebrity, the late Aaron Swartz, and has been further developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work.
Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, like the one here at the Washington Post.
There you can upload documents or send information, just like with any ordinary contact form.
These are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access to.
So the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and much of the information it would request would not be available in the first place.
However, SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.
Unfortunately, governments around the world are constantly developing new espionage technologies that endanger us all.
It is up to us to ensure that not only technology experts like Edward Snowden have a way to expose wrongdoing. It is equally important that we protect the next whistleblower,
who is aware of shortcomings in the care of soldiers and wants to report on overcrowded hospitals. Or the next environmental employee who sounds the alarm about the contaminated water in Flint. Or a Wall Street insider who warns us about the next financial crisis.
After all, these technologies were not only created for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect the constitutional rights of all of us.
Thank you.
