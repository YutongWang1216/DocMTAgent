What do you think when you look at me?
A believer? An expert?
Maybe even a sister.
Or oppressed, subjected to brainwashing, a terrorist?
Or simply a delay at the security check at the airport.
That is actually true.
I do not blame you for your negative impressions.
This is how the media portrays people who look like me.
A study found that 80% of the coverage on Islam and Muslims is negative.
Studies show: Americans think that most of them do not know any Muslims.
Presumably, people do not talk to their Uber drivers.
For those who have never met a Muslim before: It's great to meet you.
I will tell you who I am.
I am a mother, a coffee lover - double espresso, with extra cream.
I am introverted,
a wannabe fitness fanatic,
and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.
But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born this way.
I have made the decision.
When I was 17 years old, I made the decision to come out.
No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim woman. I decided to wear the hijab, my head covering.
My feminist friends were horrified: "Why are you oppressing yourself?"
The funny thing was: Back then, it was actually a feminist declaration of independence for me, against the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old to conform to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.
I did not just passively adopt the faith of my parents.
I struggled with the Quran.
I read it, thought, questioned, doubted, and ultimately believed.
My relationship with God was not love at first sight.
She was trust and slow devotion, deepening with each reading of the Quran.
The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.
I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.
Have you ever had the feeling that someone perceives you, fully understands you, and yet somehow loves you?
That's what it feels like.
Later I got married and started my career as an engineer, like all good Egyptians.
Later, after my marriage, I had a child and essentially lived the "Egyptian-American Dream".
Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.
Many of you probably remember exactly where you were.
I sat in my kitchen, had finished breakfast, looked at the screen, and saw the word "Breaking News."
There was smoke, planes flying into buildings, people jumping out of the buildings.
What was that?
An accident?
A technical malfunction?
My shock quickly turned into outrage.
Why would one do such a thing?
I changed the TV channel and heard: "... Muslim terrorists ...," "... in the name of Islam ...," "... of Middle Eastern descent ...," "... jihad ...," "... bombed Mecca!"
Oh my God.
Not only has my country been attacked, but in an instant, the actions of others transformed me from a citizen into a suspect.
On the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start postgraduate studies.
I remember how, as we drove in silence, I huddled as deeply as I could into my seat, and for the first time, I feared being recognized as a Muslim.
That night, we moved into our apartment in a new city, where it felt like a completely different world.
And then I heard, saw, and read the warnings from national Islamic organizations, stating: "Be vigilant," "Be cautious," "Stay in well-lit areas," "Do not gather."
I stayed indoors the whole week.
Then it became Friday in that week - the day when Muslims gather for prayer.
And again the warnings sounded: "Do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a target."
I watched the extensive coverage.
The feelings were understandably raw, and I also heard about attacks on Muslims or people who were mistaken for Muslims being dragged outside and beaten.
There were indeed arson attacks on mosques.
I thought: We should stay at home.
But something didn't feel right.
Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.
I received the anger of people towards the terrorists.
Imagine! I was also angry.
It is not easy to constantly have to explain oneself.
I have nothing against questions, I love questions.
It's the accusations that are harsh.
These days, we can actually hear people say: "There is a problem in this country - it's called Muslims."
"When will we get rid of them?"
Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.
They speak of my community as a tumor in the body of the USA.
The only question is: Are we malignant or benign?
They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole, and a benign tumor is simply kept under observation.
The alternatives are meaningless because the question is asked incorrectly.
Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.
Thank you!
Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.
Will closing mosques make America safer?
It may free up a few parking spaces, but it will not stop the terror.
Regularly attending a mosque leads people of other faiths to be more tolerant and show greater civic engagement.
And as a police chief in the Washington, DC area recently told me: People are actually not radicalized in mosques.
They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.
In the radicalization process, it has been observed that it starts online. First, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremist group can brainwash them, leading the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who detests their behavior and ideology is a traitor or has fallen away from faith.
If we want to prevent radicalization, we must encourage people to go to the mosque.
Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.
Finally, a group like ISIS justifies its brutality with the Quran.
As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like ISIS.
But we would conform to their worldview if we were to recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.
Thank you!
ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has to do with Christianity.
Both groups claim that their ideology is based on their "Holy Book".
But when one takes a closer look at them, they are not driven by what they read in their "Holy Book."
It is their brutality that makes them read these things into the scripture.
A prominent Imam recently told me an amazing story:
A girl came to him because she intended to join ISIS.
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.
He said the problem was exactly the opposite. Every clergyman she had spoken to silenced her and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only get her into trouble.
Inspired by nothing and lacking something that would give her anger meaning, she became a prime target for exploitation by extremists who promised her a solution.
This Imam reestablished the connection to God and their community.
Instead of blaming her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for real change in the world.
What she learned in the mosque prevented her from joining ISIS.
That was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.
But how does it affect ordinary Americans?
How does it affect everyone else?
How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy, our freedom of thought?
A study - actually several neuroscientific studies - show: When we are afraid, at least three things happen.
We are more likely to accept an authoritarian government system, conformity, and prejudices.
A study shows: When test subjects are presented with news reports that negatively portray Muslims, they are more likely to support military attacks on Muslim countries and the curtailment of the rights of American Muslims.
This is not just an academic problem.
If you look at when the sentiment against Muslims spiked - between 2001 and 2013 - this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.
It happened in the lead-up to the Iraq War and during two election cycles.
So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terrorism, as I had expected.
It can indeed be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has rational and well-informed citizens.
The treatment of Muslims is an early warning sign.
We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.
Assigning collective guilt is not just about having to explain oneself.
Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both were attending school.
Deah was an athlete.
He was at the dental school, talented, promising ...
His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.
She visited him there and he showed her his resume. She was amazed and said:
"When did my little brother become such a skilled young man?"
Just a few weeks after Suzanne visited her brother and his wife, their neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, as well as Yusor's sister Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon. He did it in their apartment, like an execution, after posting comments against Muslims on his Facebook page.
He shot Deah eight times.
Fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also deadly.
So back to the beginning.
What happened after 9/11?
Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?
We discussed it, and for us, it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely practice our religion.
We decided on the mosque.
Silently, with our son in the child seat, we drove at high speed to the mosque.
I took him out, took off my shoes, walked into the prayer hall, and what I saw made me stop.
The hall was completely filled.
Then the imam made an announcement, thanked everyone, and welcomed our guests, as half of those gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers, and non-believers who had come not to attack us, but to support us.
At that moment, I collapsed.
These people were there because they had chosen courage and compassion over panic and prejudice.
What will you choose?
What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?
Will you play it safe?
Or will you join those who believe: We are better than them.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much!
Helen Walters: So Dalia, you seem to have struck a nerve.
But I wonder, what do you say to those who may claim that you are giving a TEDTalk, a deep thinker, working in a prestigious think tank, therefore an exception and not the rule.
What would you say to those people?
Dalia Mogahed: I would say, do not be mistaken. I am completely normal.
I am not an exception.
My story is not unusual.
I am as ordinary as allowed.
When looking at Muslims around the world, and I did that with the largest study ever conducted on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.
They want prosperity for their family, they want work, and they want to live in peace.
So in no way am I an exception.
When people appear to be an exception to the rule, often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.
HW: Thank you very much. Dalia Mogahed.
