        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, originally from Seattle, Washington, was initially pushed by their parents to pursue a career as a professional French horn player, leading them to drop out of college at 19 and perform in the United States and Europe with their parents' support. A conversation on Christmas Day at 27 revealed their parents' concerns about their well-being. Meanwhile, witnessing poverty as a child sparked another individual's interest in studying poverty and its effects, leading to questions about the progression of the situation over time. The author was surprised to learn that global poverty has decreased by 80% since the 1970s, inspiring them to seek out reasons behind this progress to help the remaining 2 billion people in poverty. They are determined to find solutions from mainstream economists, regardless of their political affiliations.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, originally from Seattle, Washington, was initially pushed by their parents to pursue a career as a professional French horn player, leading them to drop out of college at 19 and perform in the United States and Europe with their parents' support. A conversation on Christmas Day at 27 revealed their parents' concerns about their well-being. Witnessing poverty as a child sparked another individual's interest in studying poverty and its effects, leading to questions about the progression of the situation over time. The author was surprised to learn that global poverty has decreased by 80% since the 1970s, inspiring them to seek out reasons behind this progress to help the remaining 2 billion people in poverty. They are determined to find solutions from mainstream economists, regardless of their political affiliations. The paragraph also discusses how 2 billion people have escaped poverty due to reasons such as globalization, free trade, property rights, the rule of law, and entrepreneurial spirit brought about by the global free market economic system. While acknowledging that the free market economy is not perfect, the author emphasizes its importance in building a better world and highlights the role of capitalism in fulfilling aspirations and dreams. The author also mentions a realization about promoting the development of the world and their country. The viewpoint on lifting people out of poverty is encapsulated in the quote \"The free market has created the most wealth in history\" by someone else.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, originally from Seattle, Washington, was initially pushed by their parents to pursue a career as a professional French horn player, leading them to drop out of college at 19 and perform in the United States and Europe with their parents' support. A conversation on Christmas Day at 27 revealed their parents' concerns about their well-being. Witnessing poverty as a child sparked another individual's interest in studying poverty and its effects, leading to questions about the progression of the situation over time. The author was surprised to learn that global poverty has decreased by 80% since the 1970s, inspiring them to seek out reasons behind this progress to help the remaining 2 billion people in poverty. They are determined to find solutions from mainstream economists, regardless of their political affiliations. The paragraph also discusses how 2 billion people have escaped poverty due to reasons such as globalization, free trade, property rights, the rule of law, and entrepreneurial spirit brought about by the global free market economic system. While acknowledging that the free market economy is not perfect, the author emphasizes its importance in building a better world and highlights the role of capitalism in fulfilling aspirations and dreams. The author also mentions a realization about promoting the development of the world and their country. The viewpoint on lifting people out of poverty is encapsulated in the quote \"The free market has created the most wealth in history\" by someone else. The paragraph also discusses the importance of coming together to discuss ideas and solutions to the current crisis facing politically divided countries, including the United States. The author recalls a moment when President Obama told them about the need for unity and cooperation. The paragraph also mentions a scientific article on asymmetric political motives, which describes how individuals often perceive their own beliefs as based on love and the beliefs of others as based on hatred, leading to conflicts such as the one between Palestinians and Israelis.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, originally from Seattle, Washington, was pushed by their parents to pursue a career as a professional French horn player, leading them to drop out of college at 19 and perform in the United States and Europe with their parents' support. A conversation on Christmas Day at 27 revealed their parents' concerns about their well-being. Witnessing poverty as a child sparked another individual's interest in studying poverty and its effects, leading to questions about the progression of the situation over time. The author was surprised to learn that global poverty has decreased by 80% since the 1970s, inspiring them to seek out reasons behind this progress to help the remaining 2 billion people in poverty. They are determined to find solutions from mainstream economists, regardless of their political affiliations. The paragraph also discusses how 2 billion people have escaped poverty due to reasons such as globalization, free trade, property rights, the rule of law, and entrepreneurial spirit brought about by the global free market economic system. While acknowledging that the free market economy is not perfect, the author emphasizes its importance in building a better world and highlights the role of capitalism in fulfilling aspirations and dreams. The author also mentions a realization about promoting the development of the world and their country. The viewpoint on lifting people out of poverty is encapsulated in the quote \"The free market has created the most wealth in history\" by someone else. The paragraph also discusses the significant divide between Republicans and Democrats in the United States, with many believing they are motivated by love while others are driven by hatred. The solution to this problem is acknowledging and accepting these divisions rather than trying to eliminate them. Research by psychologist Jonathan Haidt shows that conservatives and liberals have very different priorities, with liberals focusing more on poverty and conservatives on economic freedom. Despite these differences, the author argues that our strength as a society lies in embracing and working with these differences. The paragraph also mentions a scientific article on asymmetric political motives, which describes how individuals often perceive their own beliefs as based on love and the beliefs of others as based on hatred, leading to conflicts such as the one between Palestinians and Israelis.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, originally from Seattle, Washington, was pushed by their parents to pursue a career as a professional French horn player, leading them to drop out of college at 19 and perform in the United States and Europe with their parents' support. A conversation on Christmas Day at 27 revealed their parents' concerns about their well-being. Witnessing poverty as a child sparked another individual's interest in studying poverty and its effects, leading to questions about the progression of the situation over time. The author was surprised to learn that global poverty has decreased by 80% since the 1970s, inspiring them to seek out reasons behind this progress to help the remaining 2 billion people in poverty. They are determined to find solutions from mainstream economists, regardless of their political affiliations. The paragraph also discusses how 2 billion people have escaped poverty due to reasons such as globalization, free trade, property rights, the rule of law, and entrepreneurial spirit brought about by the global free market economic system. While acknowledging that the free market economy is not perfect, the author emphasizes its importance in building a better world and highlights the role of capitalism in fulfilling aspirations and dreams. The author also mentions a realization about promoting the development of the world and their country. The viewpoint on lifting people out of poverty is encapsulated in the quote \"The free market has created the most wealth in history\" by someone else. The paragraph also discusses the significant divide between Republicans and Democrats in the United States, with many believing they are motivated by love while others are driven by hatred. The solution to this problem is acknowledging and accepting these divisions rather than trying to eliminate them. Research by psychologist Jonathan Haidt shows that conservatives and liberals have very different priorities, with liberals focusing more on poverty and conservatives on economic freedom. Despite these differences, the author argues that our strength as a society lies in embracing and working with these differences. The paragraph also mentions a scientific article on asymmetric political motives, which describes how individuals often perceive their own beliefs as based on love and the beliefs of others as based on hatred, leading to conflicts such as the one between Palestinians and Israelis. The paragraph also discusses the importance of addressing poverty issues within the global free market economic order and the need for innovative thinking to help lift people out of poverty. It emphasizes the importance of investing overseas in a sustainable and ethical manner, as well as the need for flexible thinking and less predictability in order to generate new ideas. The paragraph also highlights the dangers of following predictable thoughts and only listening to those who agree with our opinions, and mentions the different perspectives of conservatives and liberals when it comes to discussing the economy.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, originally from Seattle, Washington, was pushed by their parents to pursue a career as a professional French horn player, leading them to drop out of college at 19 and perform in the United States and Europe with their parents' support. A conversation on Christmas Day at 27 revealed their parents' concerns about their well-being. Witnessing poverty as a child sparked another individual's interest in studying poverty and its effects, leading to questions about the progression of the situation over time. The author was surprised to learn that global poverty has decreased by 80% since the 1970s, inspiring them to seek out reasons behind this progress to help the remaining 2 billion people in poverty. They are determined to find solutions from mainstream economists, regardless of their political affiliations. The paragraph also discusses how 2 billion people have escaped poverty due to reasons such as globalization, free trade, property rights, the rule of law, and entrepreneurial spirit brought about by the global free market economic system. While acknowledging that the free market economy is not perfect, the author emphasizes its importance in building a better world and highlights the role of capitalism in fulfilling aspirations and dreams. The author also mentions a realization about promoting the development of the world and their country. The viewpoint on lifting people out of poverty is encapsulated in the quote \"The free market has created the most wealth in history\" by someone else. The paragraph also discusses the significant divide between Republicans and Democrats in the United States, with many believing they are motivated by love while others are driven by hatred. The solution to this problem is acknowledging and accepting these divisions rather than trying to eliminate them. Research by psychologist Jonathan Haidt shows that conservatives and liberals have very different priorities, with liberals focusing more on poverty and conservatives on economic freedom. Despite these differences, the author argues that our strength as a society lies in embracing and working with these differences. The paragraph also mentions a scientific article on asymmetric political motives, which describes how individuals often perceive their own beliefs as based on love and the beliefs of others as based on hatred, leading to conflicts such as the one between Palestinians and Israelis. The paragraph also discusses the importance of addressing poverty issues within the global free market economic order and the need for innovative thinking to help lift people out of poverty. It emphasizes the importance of investing overseas in a sustainable and ethical manner, as well as the need for flexible thinking and less predictability in order to generate new ideas. The paragraph also highlights the dangers of following predictable thoughts and only listening to those who agree with our opinions, and mentions the different perspectives of conservatives and liberals when it comes to discussing the economy. The paragraph emphasizes the importance of uniting to reduce poverty, stating that both conservatives and liberals need to work together and embrace each other's perspectives. The writer suggests that simply tolerating differing opinions is not enough, and that action must be taken to help those in need. The paragraph encourages individuals to blur ideological boundaries and focus on specific issues, such as poverty, in order to create a strong and successful future for all.",
