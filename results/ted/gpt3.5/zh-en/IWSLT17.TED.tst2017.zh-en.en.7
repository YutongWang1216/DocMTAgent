When I was young, I always fantasized about the ocean.
There, it is colorful and vibrant, home to many animals that look like aliens.
I have imagined the great sharks at the top of the food chain, and also fantasized about sea turtles gracefully dancing among the coral reefs.
As a photographer who switched from marine biology, most of my career has been spent searching for those places that appeared in my childhood fantasies.
As everyone can see, I started adventuring in the water from a very young age.
But the first time I truly dived into the water happened when I was 10 years old.
I can still clearly remember now, when I paddled hard to reach a rusty cannon lying on the coral reef.
Finally, I successfully reached the cannon. As I looked up, I found myself surrounded by a school of fish, various colors like a rainbow.
From that day on, I fell deeply in love with the ocean.
(Subtitles: Thomas Peschak) (Subtitles: Conservation Photographer) Over the past 40 years, I have been fortunate to explore the most wonderful marine landscapes on Earth, contributing to National Geographic magazine and the "Save Our Seas" Foundation.
My subjects range from giant sharks to tiny creatures that can swim in the palm of your hand.
In the cold sea off the Great Bear Rainforest in Canada, I once encountered a humpback whale feasting right next to me, the fishy smell in its mouth unforgettable.
In the Mozambique Channel, I witnessed the courtship ritual of the green sea turtle.
Each and every one of us will impact the ocean, and will also be influenced by the ocean.
The pristine ocean that I dreamt of in my childhood is becoming increasingly difficult to find.
Their range is shrinking day by day, and the threats they face are increasing.
We humans have always occupied the top of the food chain on Earth, and I have witnessed and documented these behaviors with my camera.
For a long time, I believed that only shocking photos could awaken my audience.
Of course, this perspective also has its benefits, as it allows me to return to the starting point.
I believe the best way to bring about change is to spread love.
I feel like a bridge between humans and animals. As a photographer, I have a rare opportunity to uncover the mysterious veil of animals and ecosystems hidden deep in the ocean.
If you don't even know something exists, how can you love and protect it?
And this, is precisely the strength of us conservation photographers.
I have visited hundreds of different marine areas, but only a few truly unforgettable scenes remain etched in my memory.
The first time I was struck by such a scene was almost ten years ago, on the rugged and steep coast of South Africa.
Every year in June and July, countless sardines migrate north, a phenomenon we call the "sardine run."
Believe me, these fish must do so.
Because there are hungry and agile predators chasing in groups behind.
For example, dolphins hunting in groups will separate some sardines from the school and herd them into a ball.
The dolphins will drive these sardines to a place closer to the sea surface and then rush into the school of fish to feast heartily, enjoying this mobile feast.
Following closely behind are the sharks.
Most people would think that sharks and dolphins are natural enemies, but in the "sardine run," they coexist.
In fact, with the help of dolphins, sharks enjoy their meals even more.
Without the dolphins' herding, it would be difficult for the sardines to form a ball, and the sharks often swim through the middle of the fish school, just like passing through a donut, sometimes ending up drinking a bellyful of water.
I have had several close encounters with shark groups in the "sardine run," and I understand that the sharks did not pay much attention to me.
But I kept getting bumped into, swept by tails, just like the other guests at this noisy feast.
We sailed east from the African coastline, across the vast Indian Ocean, to the Maldives - an archipelago composed of coral reefs.
During the continuous southwest monsoon season with storms, devil rays living in the island group waters will gather near a small island called Hanifaru in the Baa Atoll.
Groups of small shrimp and crabs, most smaller than our pupils, are the main food source for devil rays.
When these planktonic organisms are more scattered, devil rays typically hunt alone, constantly rolling backward in the water, resembling a puppy chasing its own tail.
And when planktonic organisms gather more and more, devil rays begin to link head to tail, forming a long queue for feeding, with the delicious bits missed by the leading devil ray being devoured clean by its companions behind.
As the plankton in the bay gather more and more, the formation of the devil rays also becomes more and more concentrated. This unique hunting method is called the "whirlwind feeding method."
The devil rays stack layer upon layer, forming a tight formation that rotates, creating a vortex that sucks in plankton, directly sending them into the huge mouths of the devil rays.
Diving among hundreds of devil rays, that scene is unforgettable to me for a lifetime.
When I first went to Hanifaru to take photos, it had not been protected yet, and the local ecosystem was threatened by development.
By collaborating with non-governmental organizations like the "Devil Ray Trust Fund," my photos ultimately helped Hanifaru become a marine protected area.
The fishermen on the nearby islands once hunted and killed many devil rays, using their skins to make traditional drums.
And now, they have become the most steadfast protectors of devil rays, bringing in over 8 million dollars in revenue for the Maldives each year.
I have always wanted to go back to the past, back to the time when most maps were still blank or marked with "Here be dragons."
So far, the most similar places I have visited are some remote atolls located in the western Indian Ocean.
Diving there, far away from fishing grounds and fishing boats, always fills me with sadness, as it reminds me of how the ocean used to be.
Few people have heard of India Reef, a small coral atoll located in the Mozambique Channel.
The outer reefs formed a protective barrier, while the central lagoon became a nursery for Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are never shy, even during the daytime.
I guess they will be more active at night, and there will be more of them.
I had never seen so many sharks in a coral lagoon before.
Recording and sharing these moments - constantly reminding me of the original intention of choosing this path.
Earlier this year, to fulfill a contract with National Geographic magazine, I came to the California Peninsula.
In the central part of the peninsula, on the side facing the Pacific Ocean, lies the San Ignacio Atoll Lagoon, which is an important breeding ground for gray whales.
In the past hundred years, this coastline has been a massive slaughterhouse, where over 20,000 gray whales were killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
And now, the descendants of these gray whales will push their calves to the surface of the sea, play and frolic, and even interact with us.
This species has surprisingly made a recovery.
On the other side of the peninsula is Punta Puelmo, a peaceful small fishing village.
Decades of overfishing once brought this village to the brink of bankruptcy.
In 1995, local fishermen convinced the government to designate this sea area as a marine protected area.
What happened next can only be described as a miracle.
In 2005, just after 10 years of protection, scientists discovered that the local fish population had experienced a record recovery.
Seeing is believing, come with me.
Take a deep breath and dive with me into the depths of the sea to see what the largest and most densely packed schools of fish I have encountered look like.
We all have the ability to create hope.
I want to convey a message through my photos - it's not too late to start saving the ocean now.
I especially want to focus on the natural world's ability to recover, even in the face of 7.3 billion people.
I hope that in the future, it will become increasingly difficult for me to capture such photos, and instead capture more photos reflecting the harmonious coexistence between humans and the ocean.
I really wish I could capture photos like this every day.
To make a name for yourself in our field, you must be an incorrigible optimist.
I always shoot with the assumption that the next great photo that can bring about change is right in front of me, perhaps just behind the next coral reef, in the next lagoon, or maybe in the one after that.
