Sometimes, as a European, I feel very ashamed.
Last year, over a million people arrived in Europe needing our help, and our response? To be honest, it was very sad.
There are too many contradictions here.
We mourn the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi, however, since then, over two hundred children have tragically drowned in the Mediterranean Sea.
We have international conventions recognizing that receiving refugees is a shared responsibility of all countries. However, we accept a small area like Lebanon to receive more Syrian refugees than the entire Europe combined.
We condemn the existence of human trafficking, yet we have made it the only viable way to seek asylum in Europe.
We are facing a shortage of labor, yet we are preventing those who can meet our economic and population development needs from entering Europe.
We claim that our liberal values are opposite to those upheld by the Islamic fundamentalists, yet we use a high-pressure policy to detain child asylum seekers, separating children from their families and forcibly confiscating refugees' property.
What are we doing?
How did the situation develop to such an extent? We are addressing a humanitarian crisis in an inhumane manner.
I don't believe it's because people don't care. At least, I don't want to believe that.
I believe this is because our politicians lack foresight and lack the ability to adapt to the challenges posed fifty years ago in order to address a constantly changing and globalizing world.
International refugee system. So what I want to do is take a step back and raise two very basic questions that we all must understand.
First, why isn't the existing system working?
Secondly, how do we solve this?
The modern refugee system was established after World War II by these people.
Its original intention was to ensure that when a country collapses or, worse, when the government is hostile to its people, these people have somewhere to seek refuge, where they can live safely and with dignity until they can return home.
This is exactly the situation we see today in Syria.
Through the international conference signed by 147 governments in 1951, the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and an international organization, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), committing to allow people from other countries to enter their territory to escape conflict and persecution.
But now, this system is collapsing.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In reality, our immigration policy is blocking this path to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek equal treatment or the right to choose to return to their homeland.
But in practice, they are trapped in a state of almost indefinite stagnation.
In theory, the refugee issue is a responsibility shared by all countries.
In reality, geographical location means that countries close to conflicts are overwhelmingly burdened with receiving the majority of refugees.
The provisions of the existing refugee system are not the cause of its collapse.
It is not that we have not adequately adapted to the changing world, but that is what we need to reconsider.
Therefore, I hope to explain to you how the current system is functioning.
How is the current refugee reception system operating now?
But this is not from a top-down macro perspective, but from the perspective of individual refugees.
So, imagine a Syrian woman.
Let's call her Amira for now.
Amira represents many refugees I have met in the region.
Amira, like about a quarter of the world's refugees, is a woman with children. She cannot go back home because her city, the now devastated city of Homs that you see, once a beautiful and historically rich city.
Therefore, Amira cannot go back.
Amira also has no hope of resettling in a third country because that is like winning the lottery, with less than one percent of refugees in the world having that possibility.
So Amira and her family are facing an almost impossible choice.
They have three basic options.
The first option is for Amira to take her family to a refugee camp.
In the refugee camp, she may receive assistance, but for Amira and her family, the prospects are very bleak.
The camp is located in a desolate and barren area, usually in the midst of a desert.
At the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, you can hear the sound of artillery shells crossing the Syrian border at night.
Economic activities there are restricted.
The quality of education is usually very low.
Moreover, around eighty percent of refugees worldwide in refugee camps have to stay there for at least five years.
This is a miserable place, which may also explain why only nine percent of Syrians choose this option in reality.
Or Amira could go to a city in a neighboring country, such as Amman or Beirut.
Seventy-five percent of Syrian refugees choose this option.
But even there, the difficulties are numerous.
Refugees in the city often do not have the right to work.
They often do not have access to channels for assistance.
So when Amira and her family have exhausted their basic savings, they are left with very little and are likely to face poverty.
There is a third option that more and more Syrians are choosing.
Amira can seek hope for her family by embarking on a potentially life-threatening journey to another country. This is the situation we see in Europe today.
On a global scale, we leave refugees with an almost impossible choice among these three options: refugee camps, urban poverty, and perilous journeys.
For refugees, this choice is the current global refugee system.
But I think this is a wrong choice.
I believe we can reevaluate this choice.
The reason we limit these options is because we believe these are the only options available to refugees, but in fact they are not.
Politicians have framed it as a zero-sum game - if refugees benefit, then citizens must incur losses.
We seem to agree on one assumption: that refugees are an inevitable burden and expense to society.
But this is not a fixed pattern; refugees can make contributions.
So what I want to prove is that we have ways to expand that option and still benefit everyone: including the host country and community, our society, and the refugees themselves.
I want to propose four approaches to transform our established ideas about refugees.
These four approaches share a common point: we have all utilized globalization, social mobility, and market opportunities to update our understanding of the refugee issue.
The first thing I want to consider is the concept of creating an environment, which stems from a fundamental understanding that refugees, like everyone else, are simply in a specific environment.
My colleagues at Oxford University and I have started a research project in Uganda, studying the economic lives of refugees.
We chose Uganda not because it is a typical representative of host countries.
It is precisely an exception.
Unlike most host countries in the world, what Uganda has done is to provide refugees with economic opportunities.
Give them the right to work, give them freedom of movement.
The result is astonishing, both for the refugees and the host countries.
In the Ugandan capital Kampala, we found that twenty-one percent of refugees start their own businesses and employ others, with forty percent of employees being nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees are creating employment for nationals of the host country.
Even in refugee camps, we found examples of vibrant and thriving entrepreneurial businesses.
For example, in a refugee camp called Nakivale, we found Congolese refugees running a business trading digital music.
We found businesses run by Rwandan refugees that allow young people to play computer games on recycled consoles and screens.
Breaking through extreme constraints, refugees are constantly innovating. Before you stands a Congolese man named Damon Kay.
When he arrived at the refugee camp, he had nothing but the desire to become a filmmaker.
So, together with friends and colleagues, he founded a community radio station. He rented a camera and is now making films.
He has already filmed two documentaries with our team, and for our team, and he started with scarce resources but now has a successful career.
It is precisely this kind of example that should guide our response to refugees.
Rather than assuming that refugees are inevitably dependent on humanitarian aid, we need to provide them with opportunities to achieve human prosperity.
Yes, clothing, blankets, shelter, and food are all very important during the emergency phase, but we must also have long-term considerations.
We need to provide access to the internet, electricity, the right to education and work, funding, and commercial channels.
All the pathways we take for granted to enter the global economy should and must be provided to refugees.
The second idea I want to discuss is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world have adopted Uganda's policies.
Most host countries' economies are not open to refugees, but we still have effective alternative choices.
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, development economist Paul Korya. We discussed an idea there with the international community and local government, which was to bring employment to Syrians while also promoting Jordan's national development strategy.
The idea is to establish an economic zone where we can integrate the employment of refugees with the employment of Jordanian nationals in the host country.
Just a 15-minute drive from Zaatari refugee camp, where 83,000 refugees are settled, is an existing economic zone called the King Hussein Development Zone.
The government has invested over one hundred million US dollars in connecting the power grid and roads, but two things are still lacking: labor force and foreign investment.
So, what if refugees could work there instead of being trapped in refugee camps, afford their livelihood before returning to Syria, and develop skills through vocational training?
We realized that doing so would benefit Jordan. Its national development strategy requires upgrading the manufacturing industry as a middle-income country.
Doing so benefits refugees and also contributes to the post-war reconstruction of Syria by recognizing the need to cultivate refugees as the best resource for ultimately rebuilding Syria.
We published this viewpoint in the journal "Foreign Affairs."
King Abdullah of Jordan also adopted this idea.
Two weeks ago, it was announced at the Syria conference in London that the pilot project will begin implementation this summer.
The third idea I want to present is the preference matching between the country and refugees. To achieve this satisfying outcome depicted in this selfie, the photo shows German Chancellor Merkel and a Syrian refugee.
We rarely ask refugees what they want or where they want to go, but I advocate for doing so while benefiting everyone.
Economist Alvin Roth created the concept of matching markets, where the preference order of both parties determines the final match.
My colleagues Will Jones and Eric Tateboin are researching how to apply this concept to address the refugee issue. They ask refugees to rank their preferred countries while allowing countries to rank the types of refugees they want to accept based on skills or language criteria, and then match the two rankings.
Of course, you need to establish quotas in terms of diversity and vulnerability, but this is a method that can increase the likelihood of matching.
This matching concept has been successfully applied to, for example, matching students and universities, matching kidney donors and patients, highlighting the importance of algorithm rules in dating websites.
So why not apply it to provide refugees with better choices?
This can also be applied at the national level, where the biggest issue we face is convincing local communities to accept refugees.
Currently, taking my country as an example, we often send engineers to remote areas and farmers to the city, which makes no sense at all.
So matching markets provide a potential way to match these preferences and reflect the needs and demands of both the people in the receiving country and the refugees.
My fourth idea is humanitarian visas.
The majority of tragedies and chaos we see in Europe can be completely avoided.
This stems from a fundamental contradiction in European asylum policy as follows: in order to seek asylum in Europe, you must arrive in Europe on your own, after a dangerous journey I described earlier. But why are these journeys necessary?
In an era where budget airlines and embassies exist?
These journeys are completely unnecessary, leading to over three thousand deaths last year at the borders and within Europe.
If refugees could directly go to Europe and seek asylum, we could avoid these deaths. This can indeed be achieved through humanitarian visas, which allow people to obtain visas at embassies or consulates in neighboring countries and then pay for themselves to travel to Europe by cruise or plane.
It costs about one thousand euros to bring a stowaway from Turkey to the Greek islands.
For just two hundred euros, you can fly from Bodrum, Turkey to Frankfurt, Germany on a budget airline.
If we allow them to do so, it will bring great results.
This will save lives, eradicate the illegal smuggling market, and eliminate the chaos we see on the edges of Europe, in regions like the Greek islands.
The reason why we are prevented from implementing this plan is political, not a rational solution.
And this is an idea that has already been applied.
Brazil was the first to adopt this policy, with over 2,000 Syrians obtaining humanitarian visas to enter Brazil and applying for refugee status upon arrival.
In that plan, every Syrian was granted refugee status and confirmed to be a genuine refugee.
There is also a historical precedent.
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports served as travel documents, allowing 450,000 Assyrians, Turks, and Chechens to travel across Europe and apply for refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
The Nansen International Refugee Office was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, recognizing this feasible strategy.
So the four ideas I presented to you are all ways in which we can increase the options for Amira.
Allowing refugees to have better options, beyond just the three basic and impossible options as I mentioned earlier, while still benefiting everyone.
Overall, we need a fresh perspective to increase the options for refugees, while also recognizing that they may not necessarily be a burden on society.
Refugees becoming an expense is not a fixed pattern.
Indeed, refugees are our humanitarian responsibility, but they are also individuals with skills, talents, and aspirations, capable of contributing to society - if we allow them to.
In a new world, migration will not disappear.
The scenes we see in Europe will continue to exist for many years.
People will continue to migrate, people will still leave their homes. We need to find a rational and realistic way to manage - not based on the old logic of humanitarian aid, not based on charity, but based on the opportunities brought by globalization, markets, and mobility.
I hope everyone realizes this, and I implore our government officials to rise to this challenge.
Thank you all.
