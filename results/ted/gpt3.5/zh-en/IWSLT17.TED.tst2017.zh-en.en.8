When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice issues were at the core of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
After the new government broke free from the long independence war, it immediately announced a socialist policy: making healthcare services and primary education basic free services.
The large-scale rural health service centers make it possible for 80% of the population to reach within a two-hour walk, which is truly remarkable progress.
In the year of Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, 25% of children received routine immunizations.
By 1990, just ten years later, this proportion had risen to 80%.
I am very honored to be able to participate in this transformation, in this revolution.
The excitement and comradery are both very genuine.
Working shoulder to shoulder with the outstanding people of Zimbabwe, scientists, doctors, and activists, I feel that I am not only participating in an African independence movement, but also a global public health movement for progress.
I have also faced some daunting difficulties.
In 1985, the year I arrived, Zimbabwe reported its first case of AIDS.
In the early 1980s, I cared for several AIDS patients when I was training at Harlem Hospital, but... we never imagined what we would encounter in Africa.
When I first arrived there, the infection rate was about 2%.
This proportion rapidly increased, and by the time I left Harare 17 years later, one in every four adults was infected.
By the mid-1990s, I had informed hundreds of vibrant young people that their AIDS virus tests were positive.
I witnessed colleagues and friends die, as well as my students and hospital patients.
Faced with this situation, my colleagues and I opened a clinic.
We demonstrated how to use condoms.
We conduct education and promotion at schools and workplaces.
We conduct research and provide advice on how to protect themselves for partners of AIDS-infected individuals.
We are working very hard on all of this. I believe I had already done my best at that time.
I provided the best treatment measures, at least under the conditions at that time.
But I did not make constructive changes.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan once openly admitted that it was his personal mistake that led to the genocide in Rwanda.
In 1994, he was the leader of the UN peacekeeping department.
At the tenth anniversary commemoration of the genocide, he recalled that at the time, he believed he had done everything he could, but it was only after the genocide that he realized there was much more he could and should do to sound the alarm and seek support.
The outbreak of AIDS caught the medical community off guard. The World Health Organization estimates that thirty-nine million people have died from this disease today. Many, like myself, feel regret and sorrow for not being able to stop it earlier.
But when I was living in Zimbabwe, I did not realize that I was an advocate or a politician.
I thought it was because of my medical knowledge that I went there, because of my clinical and infectious disease research.
I have always felt that my job is to take care of patients and to better understand the characteristics of the infected population through research. I hope to slow down the spread of the virus.
I realized that the proportion of marginalized groups in society infected with and dying from AIDS is surprisingly high.
In the sugar cane plantations, which resemble feudal estates more than modern enterprises, 60% of pregnant women tested positive for the AIDS virus.
My job is to show people that being infected is not a moral decline, but is related to patriarchy, forced labor, and colonialism.
Most white people are safe and sound.
As medical experts, our methods are unfortunately powerless: we beg people to change their personal behaviors, use condoms, and reduce the number of partners.
The infection rate continues to climb. As our most effective weapon against the virus, treatment is unaffordable for the entire public sector in Africa when it has already become feasible in the West.
I did not boldly state that the unequal access to life-saving drugs or the potential issues within the economic and political systems are the driving forces behind the high infection rates among such a large population.
I made excuses for my silence, reminding myself that I am just a visitor in this country. Ringing the alarm bell may lead to being expelled, making it impossible for me to do my job, take care of my patients, and conduct urgently needed research.
So I did not boldly speak out against the government's early AIDS policies.
I did not express my concerns loudly enough.
Many doctors and healthcare workers may feel that I did nothing wrong.
Our commitment to patients, like the Hippocratic Oath and its various versions, is a sacred and inviolable doctor-patient relationship.
I do everything in my power for each of my patients.
But I know that the infectious diseases that arise with the division in our society reflect not only biological phenomena, but more importantly, the phenomena of marginalization, intolerance, racial discrimination, gender discrimination, and class discrimination.
Regarding AIDS like this
Regarding the recent Ebola outbreak like this.
Medical anthropologists, such as Paul Farmer, working on AIDS in Haiti, refer to it as structural violence: structural because inequality is rooted in the political and economic organization of our society, often ignored by the privileged and ruling classes; violence because its effects, such as premature death, suffering, and disease, are violent.
We do very little for patients if we do not realize these social injustices.
Ringing the alarm bell is the first step in guiding public health in the right direction, this is the way we seek support, to break through together, to create a way for real change.
So now, I have not remained silent.
I speak boldly about many things, even if it makes the listener uncomfortable, even if it makes me uncomfortable.
Many of these are about racial segregation and organized racism, things that should not happen in this country, things that should not exist in medical practice or public health.
But they do exist, and we pay the price of shortened lives for it.
This is the reason why the impact of racism on healthcare in the United States continues to sound the alarm. The ongoing, organized violence against people of color is closely related to our tragic history of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of racial discrimination, and 60 years of imperfect equality. It is for this reason that as the Commissioner of Health in New York City, this is the focus of my work.
In New York City, the premature mortality rate, defined as death before the age of 65, is 50% higher for Black people compared to White people.
In 2012, black women faced more than 10 times the risk of pregnancy-related deaths compared to white women.
Despite the significant progress we have made in reducing infant mortality rates, the mortality rate of Black infants in the first year after birth is still nearly three times that of White infants.
New York City is not an exception.
These statistical data are similar across the entire United States.
A recent analysis by The New York Times reported that there are approximately 15 million missing black men nationwide.
The author points out that among every six black men aged 25 to 54, at least one disappears from daily life due to incarceration or premature death.
Young black people face disproportionate acts of violence in their daily lives, which is very unfair and is present in recent protests where the slogan "Black Lives Matter" has been prominently raised.
But we need to remember that in the current situation and outcomes of ordinary healthcare, as well as the persistent and disproportionately high disease rates of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, those diseases that slowly and quietly devour life, are causing more Black lives to prematurely vanish.
As the "Black Lives Matter" movement unfolds, I feel frustrated and angry. Medical groups are hesitant even in their research and work, and even in the use of the term "racism."
Every time I mention it, you probably already have a sense of it.
Medical students, dressed in white coats, protested against biological weapons with their lives, but medical groups largely stand by in the face of persistent racial discrimination and its significant impact on disease conditions and mortality rates.
I am very concerned that the trend towards personalized and targeted drugs, searching for biological and genetic targets to better design therapies, may inadvertently lead us to lose sight of the bigger picture. This is exactly the scenario of daily life, where an individual's life, growth, work, and place of love significantly impact the health of the community. For many of us, poor health is a reality.
In our daily lives, as healthcare workers, whether in clinics or conducting research, we are witnesses to great injustices: the homeless, unable to follow medical advice because they must prioritize more pressing matters; young transgender individuals planning suicide because our society is too harsh; single mothers feeling compelled to take responsibility for their children's poor health.
As healthcare workers, our role is not only to treat our patients but also to sound the alarm and advocate for change.
Regardless of whether it is reasonable or not, our social position makes our voice more credible, and we should not waste it.
I regret not being candid in Zimbabwe. I have made a commitment to myself that as the Commissioner of Health in New York City, I will use every opportunity to sound the alarm and seek support for healthcare equality.
I will speak out against racial discrimination, and I hope you can join me, and I will also join you when you speak out against gender discrimination or any form of inequality.
It's time for us to rise up and boldly speak out against structural inequalities together.
We do not need to have all the answers to advocate for change.
We just need courage.
The health of our patients, our own health, all depend on this.
