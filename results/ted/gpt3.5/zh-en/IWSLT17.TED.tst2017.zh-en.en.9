Okay, I would like everyone to raise their hands if they have ever unfriended someone on Facebook because they made inappropriate comments about politics, religion, children's rights, or food, etc.
How many of you have at least one person you don't want to see because you just don't want to talk to them?
You see, in the past, if we wanted to have a polite conversation, all we had to do was follow Henry Higgins' advice in "My Fair Lady": just talk about the weather and your health.
But in recent years, with the climate change and the rise of anti-vaccine movements, this trick doesn't work as well.
Therefore, in this world we live in, every conversation has the potential to escalate into an argument, politicians cannot communicate with each other, and even trivial matters can spark passionate support or opposition from the crowd, which is just not normal.
The Pew Research Center conducted a survey of ten thousand American adults and found that our current level of extremism, our clear positions, are higher than at any other time in history.
We are even less inclined to compromise, which means we are not listening to each other.
The decisions we make, such as where to live, who to marry, or even who to be friends with, are all based solely on our existing beliefs.
Repeating once again, this shows that we are not listening to each other.
Conversation requires a balance of speaking and listening, but somehow, we have gradually lost this balance.
Technological advancement is part of the reason.
For example, smartphones are now in your hands or right next to you, easily accessible.
According to Pew's research, approximately one-third of American teenagers send over one hundred text messages per day.
And in the midst of this, many people, almost everyone, tend to prefer sending text messages to friends rather than having face-to-face conversations.
The Atlantic magazine published a great article,
The author is high school teacher Paul Barnwell.
He assigned a communication task to his students,
Hope to teach them how to give a speech on a specific topic without relying on notes.
Then he said, "I began to realize..."
"I began to realize that communication skills may be the most overlooked skill that we have not taught well."
Children spend hours every day engaging with creativity and other peers through screens, but have few opportunities to develop their interpersonal communication skills."
This may sound funny, but we must ask ourselves: in the 21st century, what skill is more important than maintaining a coherent, confident conversation?"
Now, my job is to talk to people. Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, governors, plumbers.
I talk to people I like, as well as people I don't like.
I talk to people whom I strongly disagree with on a personal level.
But I still have very good communication with them.
So I hope to spend the next 10 minutes teaching you how to have a conversation, and how to listen.
Many of you have heard countless suggestions, such as looking into the other person's eyes, preparing interesting topics for discussion in advance, maintaining eye contact, nodding and smiling to show your focus, repeating what you just heard, or summarizing.
I want you to forget about all of this,
All of it is useless.
There's simply no need to learn how to show that you're focused if you are truly focused.
I actually use the same skills as a professional interviewer in my daily life.
Alright, I'm going to teach you how to interview others, which will actually help you learn how to become a better communicator.
Learning to start a conversation, not wasting time, not feeling bored, and, most importantly, not offending anyone.
We have all had great conversations.
We have all experienced it. We know what that feels like.
A conversation that leaves you feeling very enjoyable, inspired, or makes you feel like you have truly connected with someone, or that you have been completely understood by others.
There is no reason to say that most of your interpersonal interactions cannot be like that.
I have 10 basic rules. I will explain them one by one to you, but honestly, if you choose one and master it proficiently, you will already be able to enjoy more pleasant conversations.
Rule number one: Do not be indecisive.
I'm not saying just to put down your phone, tablet, car keys, or whatever you happen to be holding in your hand.
What I mean is, being in the present moment.
Enter into that situation.
Don't dwell on the argument you had with your boss before.
Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner.
If you want to leave the conversation, then leave the conversation. But do not be physically present while mentally elsewhere.
Rule number two: Do not act like a know-it-all.
If you want to express your opinions without leaving any room for others to respond, argue, refute, or elaborate, then write a blog.
There is a very good reason why "expert lecturing" is not allowed in my conversations: because it's really boring.
If the other party is a conservative, they must hate Obama, food stamps, and abortion.
If the other party is a liberal, they must hate big banks, oil companies, and Dick Cheney.
Completely predictable.
You definitely don't want that.
You need to assume that you can learn something every time you engage in a conversation.
Renowned therapist M. Scott Peck once said that true listening requires putting oneself aside.
Sometimes, this means putting aside your personal opinions.
He said that feeling this acceptance, the speaker will become less and less fragile and sensitive, thus becoming more likely to open up their inner world and present it to the listener.
Emphasizing once again, assume that you need to learn something new.
Bill Nye said, "Every person you are about to meet has something you don't know."
Let me restate it: Everyone is an expert in some way.
Point three: Use open-ended questions.
Regarding this point, please refer to the way journalists ask questions during interviews.
Start your questions with "who," "what," "when," "where," "why," or "how."
If you ask a complex question, you will receive a simple answer.
If I ask you, "Were you afraid at that time?"
You will respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, which is "afraid," and the answer will be either "yes" or "no."
"Were you angry at that time?" "Yes, I was very angry at that time."
Let the other party describe, as they are the ones who understand the situation.
Try asking the other party like this: "What does that look like?"
"How do you feel?"
As a result, the other party may need to pause and think, and you will receive a more interesting response.
Point Four: Go with the flow.
In other words, ideas will naturally flow into your mind, and you need to express them.
We often hear in interviews that guests speak for a few minutes, and then the host comes back to ask a question that seems to come out of nowhere or has already been answered.
This indicates that the host may not have been listening two minutes ago, as he came up with this very clever question and was so obsessed with asking it.
We also do the same thing.
When we sit down and talk with someone, we suddenly remember that encounter with Hugh Jackman at the coffee shop.
And then we stopped listening.
Stories and ideas will constantly come to you,
But even if you can't stop them, don't let them linger too much in your mind.
Point five: If you don't know, just say you don't know.
People on radio programs, especially at the national public broadcasting stations, are very aware that their conversations will be broadcasted. Therefore, they are more careful about their claims of expertise and the things they assert.
Learn to do this. Be cautious with your words and actions.
Conversations should be a responsible behavior.
Rule six: Do not compare your own experiences with others.
If the other party talks about losing family members, do not immediately start talking about your own experience of losing family members.
If the other party is talking about work-related troubles, do not tell them how much you hate your job.
This is different, it can never be the same.
Every experience is unique.
Moreover, more importantly, this is not about discussing your own matters.
You don't need to prove how capable you are at this moment, or how much pain you have endured.
Someone once asked Stephen Hawking what his IQ was, and he replied, "I don't know. People who boast about their IQ are losers."
Conversations are not meant for self-promotion.
Rule Seven: Try not to repeat yourself.
This is very aggressive and boring. But we are easily inclined to do so.
Especially in work conversations, or conversations with children, we want to make a point, so we keep saying it in different ways.
Don't do this.
Rule Eight: Avoid talking nonsense.
In plain terms, no one cares about those years, names, dates, and other details that you are trying hard to recall in your mind.
Others don't care. They are focused on you.
The other party cares about what kind of person you are and what commonalities you share.
So forget about the details. Don't worry about them.
Rule Nine: This is not the last rule, but the most important one.
Listen carefully.
I can't say exactly how many important figures have said that listening may be the most important, the first important skill you can improve.
As the Buddha said - let me paraphrase, "If your mouth doesn't stop, you won't learn anything."
Calvin Coolidge once said, "No one has ever been fired for listening too much."
Why are we unwilling to listen to each other?
First of all, we prefer to speak.
When I am speaking, everything is under my control.
I don't have to listen to anything I'm not interested in.
I am the focus.
I can strengthen my sense of identity.
But there is another reason: we will be distracted.
On average, people speak about 225 words per minute, but we can listen to nearly 500 words per minute.
So our minds are occupied by these additional 275 words.
I know it takes effort to truly pay attention to what others are saying. But if you don't do this, you're not really having a conversation.
You're just two people in the same place shouting irrelevant things at each other.
You must listen to each other.
Stephen Covey has a brilliant discourse on this.
He said, "Most of us do not listen in order to understand.
We listen in order to respond.
The final rule, Rule Ten: Be concise.
"A good conversation is like a well-fitted mini skirt; short enough to be attractive, yet long enough to cover the subject - my sister's analogy." All of this is condensed into one concept, which is: showing interest in others.
I grew up beside a famous grandfather, and my home was always filled with guests.
Visitors would come to talk with my grandparents, and after they left, my mother would come to us and say, "Do you know who that was?
She was the runner-up in the Miss America pageant.
He is the mayor of Sacramento.
She has won the Pulitzer Prize. He is a Russian ballet dancer.
In my growth, I defaulted to the belief that everyone has hidden brilliance.
To be honest, I think it is all of this that has made me a better host.
I try to speak as little as possible, but open up my thoughts, always ready to be surprised, and I never feel disappointed.
You can do the same.
Go out, talk to others, listen to what they say, and most importantly, be prepared to be surprised.
Thank you.
