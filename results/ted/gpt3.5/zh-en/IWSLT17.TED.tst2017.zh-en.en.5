Food crisis.
Appearing in the daily news.
What is that?
In some parts of the world, food is too scarce, while in other places food production is abundant.
In some places, genetically modified foods have saved the world.
Perhaps genetically modified foods are a problem?
Too much genetically modified agricultural wastewater has created polluted oceans, toxic seawater, and nutrient-poor environments.
This cycle continues in this way.
I found that the current discussions are really lacking in influence.
How can we make such discussions understood by everyone?
What about the apple food crisis?
I'm sure that each of you has eaten an apple in the past week.
How long do you think it took for the apple to go from picking to your hands?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months - this is the average time it takes for apples sold in American stores to go from picking to being sold.
I think it's probably the same in Europe as it is everywhere else in the world.
We pick apples, store them in refrigeration, and input oxygen into the refrigeration unit - in fact, there are documented cases of workers attempting to enter such an environment to retrieve an apple, only to die because the air in the refrigerated warehouse is toxic to humans.
Why do none of you know about this?
Why do I not know about this?
90% of the nutrients in apples - all the antioxidants in apples - are completely lost by the time we purchase them.
It's just a small piece of candy.
Why do we not know this news? How can we improve this situation?
I think we are lacking a platform.
I know the platform - I will use a computer, and I have been active on the internet since I was very young.
I have done many very strange things - on such a platform.
But I have also met other people, and I can express my thoughts.
What is your opinion on food?
If we had a platform, we might discover that this issue is very beneficial. "What if?"
I want to ask: What if the climate were democratic?
This is a global climate distribution map.
The most efficient agricultural production areas are green, while the worst ones are red.
They will continue to change, evolve, California farmers are now becoming Mexican farmers.
China acquires land in Brazil in pursuit of growing better food, we are all slaves to the environment.
What if each country had a climate suitable for its own production?
How would that change our lives?
How will that change the quality of our lives and nutrition?
The problem faced by the previous generation was the need for more food at a lower price.
Welcome to the world farm.
We have built a huge simulated farm.
These lines and tracks are from cars, airplanes, trains, and automobiles.
Being able to provide enough food for 7 billion people is a miracle, especially with only a few people involved in the food production process.
But if...
Are we building a digital farm?
Digital world farm.
If you could take this apple, digitize it to some extent, transmit the particles through the air, and then reassemble the particles on the other side?
What if?
Looking at these quoted words, you know, they encouraged me to do so.
Firstly: "Japanese agriculture has no young people, no water, no land, and no future." This was the day I arrived in Minamisanriku-cho, one stop south of Fukushima after the nuclear power plant accident.
The children have all gone to Sendai and Tokyo, the land has been contaminated by the nuclear power plant accident, and their food imports account for 70%.
But this is not a phenomenon unique to Japan.
Only 2% of the American population is engaged in agricultural-related work.
What answer does the 2% of the population engaged in agriculture provide us?
Looking at other parts of the world, 50% of the population in Africa is under 18 years old.
80% of them are not willing to become farmers.
Agriculture is too arduous.
Small-scale farming life is too hard.
They choose to go to the city.
In India, farmers' families cannot access the most basic agricultural tools, and the number of farmers committing suicide exceeds the total of the past 10 years.
Talking about these things is just too heartbreaking.
Where are they going?
To the city.
Without young people, all the young people have gone to the city.
So what kind of platform do we need to build to encourage young people?
Please look at this new tractor.
This is my combine harvester.
Several years ago, I went to a home improvement chain store to start looking for tools.
I have made foolish things, making plants dance by connecting them to my computer, and then I destroyed them - many of them.
I ultimately let them survive.
I have created the most intimate relationship in my life because I have learned the language of plants.
I want them to grow bigger.
They said, "Child, give it your all!
This electronic studio is not in use.
What can you do?
Together with team members, we built a farm in the media lab, a place that was previously considered to be related to electronic life rather than biology.
In this 60 square meter space, we produced enough food to supply approximately 300 people for one month - not too much.
There are many interesting technologies here.
What is the most interesting thing?
Beautiful, white roots, deep green plants harvested once a month.
Is this a modern restaurant?
Is this a modern sales experience?
Is this a modern store?
What I can confirm is: this is the first time that any plant can be uprooted in the media lab.
We put the salad in bags; there is nothing wrong with that.
But what will happen when you have an image processing expert, a data scientist, a robotics expert, uproot plants and think, "Hmm, I know about it - I can make the plan work, I want to try."
Throughout the process, we will take plants out and bring some back to the lab because if you have personally planted it, you will not abandon it; because it is precious to you.
I now have this strange tongue because I don't want anyone to eat them before me, I hope they are delicious.
I eat lettuce every day, so I know that the pH value of lettuce is less than 1.
I am like this now, "No, that's 6.1 - no, no, you can't eat it today."
(Applause) That lettuce was very sweet that day.
That's because the lettuce is under a lot of pressure, triggering a chemical reaction to protect itself: "I don't want to die!"
The taste of plants that don't want to die is sweet.
Scientists are returning to the study of plant physiology.
I think everyone can try to participate.
We look forward to seeing everyone's creations, so we have envisioned a laboratory that can be transported to other locations.
Bring such ideas into reality.
The front of this media experimental building is my laboratory, and each plant has 30 sensor points.
If you understand genomics or genetics, this is the phenotype group, right?
The phenomenon presented by the phenotype group.
When you say, "I like strawberries from Mexico," what you truly like is the strawberries produced under such climate conditions.
You can encode such climate - how much carbon dioxide, how much oxygen, creating a recipe - you can control the presentation state of plants, as well as their nutritional content, size, shape, color, and texture through programming.
We need data, so we have placed many sensors to provide us with information.
You can think back to the plants at home, looking at them feeling sad, because you wonder, "Why did you die? Will you talk to me?"
Farmers have the most beautiful eyes that can foresee the future when they are in their sixties or seventies.
They can tell you that the plant died because of a lack of nitrogen in the soil, a lack of calcium, or the need for a more humid air environment.
These beautiful eyes will not be passed down.
These are the eyes of farmers.
We will continue to collect data information.
We combine these data points with individual plants.
These are the IP address data of all the cauliflowers in my lab that day.
We have cauliflowers with traceable IP addresses.
(Applause) If this isn't weird enough, you can click here to see the plant's profile.
This shows you the downloadable growth process of that plant, not just notifying you when it is edible as you might imagine.
When will its nutrients meet my needs?
When will its taste meet my expectations?
Is there too much water?
Has it been exposed to the sun for too long?
It will all be indicated.
It can communicate with me, we can converse, we can have verbal dialogue.
(Applause) I think that's the first plant Facebook user, right?
At that time, the plant's profile, the plant will start making friends.
I mean, seriously - plants will start making friends with those that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, and less potassium.
We will start to understand those complex matters that we can only guess at now.
They may not be friendly with us - I don't know, maybe they will be friendly with us, it depends on our behavior.
This is my current lab.
This is a bit more systematic. My background is in designing data centers for hospitals, so I know how to create a controlled environment.
So - in this environment, we experiment with all sorts of things.
This system, aeroponic cultivation, was developed by NASA for the Mir space station, reducing the amount of water resources they need to transport to space.
What this system does is accurately provide plants with what they need: water, minerals, and oxygen.
The roots are not that complicated, and when you provide them with these, you can see surprising results.
Plants have two hearts.
It is precisely because they have two hearts that they exhibit 4-5 times faster growth.
This is a perfect world.
We have gone through a long process of technological development in search of a different world. We will continue to do so, but we will also have new tools, and this will be a perfect world.
We grow all sorts of things.
These tomatoes have not been put into commercial production in the past 150 years.
Do you know that we have a rare and ancient seed bank?
Seed bank.
This is awesome.
They have living germplasm of food you have never eaten.
I am the only person in this room who has eaten this kind of tomato.
The problem is, these are sauce tomatoes that we don't know how to cook, so we feel that sauce tomatoes don't seem to taste good.
But we have grown various protein-rich things.
We have grown humans - maybe you can, but we can't.
We realized that the tools were too big and too expensive.
I began placing them around the world, valued at around $100,000.
It's not easy to find someone who can freely dispose of $100,000, so we want to make smaller tools.
In fact, this is a project of one of my students - Camille, an undergraduate student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering.
Camille, my team, and I spent the entire summer repeating experiments on how to make it cheaper, how to operate it better, and how to teach others to operate it as well.
Then we brought these tools to the school for children in grades 7 to 11.
If you want to become humble, try teaching children something.
I went to this school and said, "Set its humidity at 65%."
A child in the 7th grade asked, "What humidity?"
So I said, "Oh, it's the water in the air."
He said, "There is no water in the air, you fool."
So I said, "Well, don't believe me."
In fact - don't believe me, right?
Set it to 100.
He set the humidity to 100, what happened next?
It started to condense, producing fog, and eventually began to drip water.
Then he said, "Oh, humidity is rain."
Why didn't you tell me this before?
The interface we created looks like a game.
They have a 3D environment that can be accessed worldwide from both phones and computers.
There are different sections in the program - physical adjustments, sensors.
They chose recipes that children in other parts of the world have already created.
They selected and activated recipes, planting seeds.
As the seeds grow, children can make changes.
They said, "Why do plants need carbon dioxide? Isn't carbon dioxide a bad thing?
It can suffocate people.
Increasing the supply of carbon dioxide, the plants died.
Reducing the amount of carbon dioxide, the plants thrive.
Harvesting plants, you create a new electronic recipe.
This is a process of iterative design, development, and exploration.
They can download all the data of the new plants they developed, or the new electronic recipe. What did it do - is it better or worse?
Imagine these are the processed core elements.
We can learn a lot of things.
This is what we call a food computer, placed in a school for three weeks.
This is three weeks of cultivation.
More importantly, this is the first time this child believes he can be a farmer - or, he wants to become a farmer.
So we make these resources public.
All placed online; go home and try to build your first food computer.
This will be difficult - I'm telling you this.
We are in the initial stages, but all the resources are there.
For me, making these easily accessible is very important.
We will continue to do so.
These are farmers, electronic engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, botanists, economists, and urban planners.
On a platform, do what they are good at.
The team has become too large.
This is my new experimental equipment that is starting to operate.
This warehouse can be built anywhere.
This is the reason why I chose it.
Inside this warehouse, we are going to build such a frame.
You can see it now.
Take a look at this,
This also exists.
One is planting green vegetables, the other is planting Ebola virus vaccine.
It is great that the plants and this successful project from the American Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency are the reasons for our successful research on the Ebola virus.
These plants are producing proteins that combat the Ebola virus.
So from medications and health supplements, to lettuce cultivation.
But these two things seem completely different, which is my part in my own field.
But many things are not as imagined.
We are still in the "we are right" stage, just like, "this is my little black box--" "No, buy mine."
"No, no, no -- my intellectual property is absolutely valuable.
"Don't buy that, buy mine."
In fact, we are just in the beginning stage, at this time, society is also changing.
When we want more, cheaper food, we now need higher quality, environmentally friendly food.
But when you see the ingredients of McDonald's McChicken advertised in McDonald's commercials, the most mysterious food in human history - McDonald's marketing campaign is changing - everything is changing.
Take a look at the world today.
Individual food computers, food servers, food data centers operate in the open phenotypic group.
Just like open genomics, but we need to compile the small climate recipes together, like Wikipedia, where you can edit, start, and plant.
How does this look?
Do you remember that the world is connected by fine strings?
Bacon is starting to appear.
We are starting to send information about food instead of distributing food.
This is not just my fantasy, this is the work we are already engaged in.
Food computers, food servers, and soon-to-be food data centers connect people together to share information.
The future of food is not in its erroneous struggle,
We all know where the mistake lies.
The future of food involves connecting the next generation of 1 billion farmers, and empowering them with a question-and-answer platform, "What if?"
Thank you.
