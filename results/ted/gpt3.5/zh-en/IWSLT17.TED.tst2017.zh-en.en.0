Okay, I'm going to tell a story about how we come to understand the things we know.
This story is about the woman, Natalie Lichinski.
She is a paleontologist, and her specialty is excavating ancient artifacts everywhere.
Natalie Lichinski: "Yes, some people call me 'Dr. Dead Stuff'."
I find her particularly interesting because the places she excavates are all in the high latitudes of the Arctic Circle, in the remote Canadian permafrost zone.
One summer day in 2006, she was at an archaeological excavation site called the Fossil Bed, which was less than 10 degrees away from the magnetic North Pole.
NR: "To be honest, this actually doesn't sound very exciting." "You have to carry a backpack all day, with a GPS navigator and notebook," "travelling long distances, picking up anything that might be a fossil."
However, at a certain moment, she noticed something.
"A small rusty piece," about the size of my palm."
"It was just lying on the ground."
Her first reaction was that this was just a piece of wood debris, because this was something that people had once discovered at the Fossil Bed - prehistoric plant matter.
But that night, when she returned to the camp...
NR: "I took out a hand-held microscope," "I observed more carefully, and suddenly I realized," "this thing seems to have no growth rings."
"It might be due to preservation issues," "but it really looks like..."
"Bones."
So, over the next four years, she repeatedly went to that location and eventually collected 30 pieces of fragments, all from the same bone, many of which were very tiny.
"It's actually not that much. A small zipper bag can hold it all."
Then she tried to piece the fragments together like a puzzle.
But this is very challenging.
"It shattered into many small fragments," "We tried to reconstruct it with sand and oil paint, but it looked terrible."
"Finally, we used a 3D surface scanner."
"Oh wow! "Very handsome, right?"
Finally, it was discovered that reconstructing it virtually was much simpler.
"When they were all pieced together, it felt truly miraculous."
How confident are you in piecing it together correctly, to recreate its original form?
Is it possible for you to try piecing it together in a different way, and end up piecing together... a little parrot or something?
"Oh, no way. We definitely pieced it together correctly."
She found that what she pieced together was a tibia, also known as the shinbone, and this tibia came from an artiodactyl mammal, such as cows, sheep, and the like.
But this definitely cannot be a cow or a sheep.
It is really too big.
"The size of this thing is really too big. This is a massive animal."
So what kind of animal could it be?
Now facing a bottleneck, she showed one of the fragments to some colleagues in Colorado, and they came up with an idea.
"We used a small saw and scraped a little on the edges of the fragments," "and then some very peculiar smells came from there."
It smelled a bit like burnt skin.
This is a smell that Natalie is familiar with, as she has smelled it while cutting skulls in the gross anatomy lab - it is collagen.
Collagen gives our bones hardness.
Generally speaking, after so many years, it will naturally decompose.
However, in this situation, the Arctic seems to act as a natural freezer preserving it.
After a year or two, Natalie went to Bristol to attend a conference and saw one of her colleagues, named Mike Buckley, demonstrating a new technique he called "collagen fingerprinting technology."
In fact, the collagen of different species has minor differences in structure, so if you have collagen information from an unknown bone, you can compare it with the collagen information from known species. So who knows, maybe you will find a match.
So she sent a fragment to Mike using FedEx.
"Of course, you need to closely monitor the delivery progress. It's very important."
He then processed the sample, comparing it to 37 known contemporary mammal species.
A match was found!
The final conclusion is that the bone with a history of 3.5 million years, discovered by Natalie in the high latitude Arctic Circle, is from...
A camel.
"I was thinking, are you kidding me?" "If we're not mistaken, this is truly amazing."
So they tested a large pile of fragments and got the same result for each one.
However, based on the size of the bone they discovered, this means that this camel was 30% larger than modern camels.
So this camel was probably about 2.7 meters tall and weighed a ton.
(Exclaiming) Yes.
Natalie discovered a "giant Arctic camel".
Now when you hear the word "camel", the image that comes to mind is the Bactrian camels from East Asia and Central Asia.
But more likely, the image in your mind resembles this: a dromedary camel, a typical desert animal, often found in hot desert areas such as the Middle East or the Sahara, with a large hump on its back to store water for long desert journeys, and wide hooves to help them traverse sand dunes.
So how did these guys end up running to the high latitude Arctic Circle?
In fact, scientists have long known that camels originated from the Americas before Natalie's discovery.
(Music: American national anthem "The Star-Spangled Banner") They originated from here.
During the 45 million years of existence of camels, for 40 million years, you could only find them in North America, with a total of 20 different species, perhaps even more.
"If we line them up, will they look different?"
"Yes, their body sizes vary greatly."
"Some of them have especially long necks," "so functionally they are very similar to giraffes."
Some of them also have long noses, like crocodiles.
"They are particularly primitive, with some of the earliest ones possibly very small," "almost like a small rabbit."
What? A camel the size of a rabbit?
"Some of the earliest ones were."
"You might not even recognize them anymore."
Oh my goodness, I really want a "rabbit camel" as a pet!
"I know, this must be great, right?"
Then, around 3 to 7 million years ago, a branch of camels migrated south to South America, where they evolved into llamas or alpacas, while another branch crossed the Bering Land Bridge to reach Asia and Africa.
By the end of the last Ice Age, camels in North America became completely extinct.
So, scientists have long known about these, but this does not fully explain how Natalie found camels in such a northern location.
Here, from a temperature perspective, it's basically the opposite of the Sahara.
To tell the truth, 3.5 million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius higher than it is now.
So that could be considered a northern forest, somewhat like today's Yukon River basin or Siberia.
However, they still have a six-month long winter, and all the ponds will be frozen.
You will encounter a snowstorm.
You will encounter 24 hours of continuous darkness.
What on earth... what is going on?
How could these superstars of the Sahara Desert possibly survive in such harsh conditions?
Natalie and her colleagues felt they had found the answer.
And this answer is quite clever.
What if these characteristics of camels did not evolve to adapt to environments like the Sahara, as we originally thought, but rather developed to survive harsh winters?
What if those wide feet were not meant for crossing sand dunes, but instead, like snow boots, for traversing snowy plains?
What if those humps - this is absolutely groundbreaking news! The stored content is not water but fat, the humps are actually to help camels survive the food scarcity during the six-month long harsh winter?
What if, long after they crossed the land bridge, they then modified these winter characteristics to adapt to the hot desert environment?
For example, those humps might be beneficial for camels in hot regions because when your fat accumulates in one place, you know, like a "fat backpack," it means that the insulating layer of your body doesn't have to cover your whole body.
So this makes heat dissipation easier.
It is this crazy idea that turns the seemingly typical desert characteristics on camels into evidence of their origin from the high latitudes of the Arctic.
Actually, I am not the first person to tell this story.
Others have already talked about this, praising the wonders of biological evolution or taking a glimpse at future climate change scenarios.
But I love this story for a different reason.
For me, this is a story about us, about how we perceive the world, and about how this perception changes.
My profession is a historian.
I found that actually many scientists are also historians.
They figured out what happened in the past.
They tell the history of the universe, the Earth, and Earth's organisms.
As a historian, you need to have a plan in your mind, thinking about how this story will continue.
"We create stories, and then we continue along that line of thought," "Just like the camels in the desert, right?"
"This is a fantastic story! Camels are just perfect for the desert."
"Clearly, camels have always lived there."
But at any time, you may discover some small clues.
You may discover some small things that force you to reshape everything you thought you knew.
Just like in this example, this scientist discovered this fragment, initially thinking it was wood. It was this discovery that gave rise to a completely new, counterintuitive theory in the scientific community, explaining why this strange, creature resembling a hairy monster, evolved into its current form.
For me, this completely overturned my perception of camels.
It went from being a species that existed only for this specific environment to a global traveler, just happening to appear in the Sahara Desert and potentially anywhere else at any time.
This is Azulie.
Hi, Azulie! How are you doing?
Come, I brought you something to eat.
Azulie has just finished her special performance and is coming over from the New York Radio City Music Hall.
This is no joke.
Whatever... Seriously, Azulie here serves as a vivid example, illustrating that the stories of this world are ever-changing.
We need to be proactive, make bold changes, and reimagine things.
Azulie, do you agree?
Truly, the new perspective with which we view the world is just a fragment of bone away.
Thank you, everyone.
