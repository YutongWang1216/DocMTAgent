The author's photos helped protect Hanifaru as a marine protected area, where devil rays are now protected and bring in revenue for the Maldives. The paragraph also describes the unique hunting method of devil rays called the \"whirlwind feeding method,\" where they form a tight formation and rotate to create a vortex that sucks in plankton. The author reflects on visiting remote atolls in the western Indian Ocean and India Reef, where Galapagos sharks are abundant, and a recent visit to the San Ignacio Atoll Lagoon in the California Peninsula, an important breeding ground for gray whales, is mentioned. The author's passion for recording and sharing these moments is emphasized, as he now sees the value in spreading love and returning to his original passion for the ocean.",
