We were right there. Souls and bodies squeezed into a church in Texas, that was our last night of life.
Just like this room we are in now, except there were creaking wooden benches, tattered red banners hanging, an organ to my left, a choir behind me, and a baptismal font built into the back wall.
In short, just like this room.
The same strong sense of suspense, the same deep desire for redemption, the same sour sweat in the palms, and at the back row, the same group of absent-minded people.
It was December 31, 1999, that night, as far as I knew, the Second Coming of Christ, the end of the world was approaching.
At that time, I was 12 years old, reaching the age of responsibility.
I realized that Jesus coming back at this time is so unfair, I am about to take responsibility for everything I did before. But when I stop complaining, I think I better tidy up the house quickly.
I try to go to church as much as possible.
I am afraid of the silence around me, just like how people fear noise, only to repeatedly confirm that God did not trick me, coming back early and leaving me behind.
But in case he really came early, I also have a backup plan, which I read from the popular book "End Times Maze".
I saw in the text that if I missed the midnight revelry and was not taken away, I still have one more chance.
I just need to not be labeled as a heretic, defeat demons, overcome plagues, and also defeat anti-Christians.
This will be quite difficult - but I believe I can do it.
But the time for preparation has already passed.
It's already 11:50 at night.
We have 10 minutes left, the pastor asked us to get up from the benches and walk to the altar below, because he wanted us to pray together at the moment of midnight approaching.
So the congregation divided into several groups and went to their designated positions.
The choir is still on the small stage, the church deacons and their wives - I actually prefer to call them the "Baptist bourgeoisie" - sitting in the front row in front of the altar.
You know, in the United States, even on the night of the Second Coming of Christ, there are VIP seats.
Behind the Baptist bourgeoisie, there were the older generation - the young backs of these men and women, bent by the intense sunlight in the cotton fields of East Texas, their rugged faces burnt into a noble brown, just like the clay of East Texas, their dreams and fantasies of a life and world beyond East Texas sometimes more shattered than their backs.
Yes - these men and women are my idols, my stars.
They have waited a lifetime for this moment, just like their medieval ancestors longed for the end of the world, just like my grandmother longed for Oprah Winfrey, which aired on time every day at four o'clock on Channel Eight.
As she walked towards the altar, I quietly slipped behind her, because I was very certain that my grandmother was going to heaven.
I think if I tightly hold her hand during this prayer, I might walk with her.
So I tightened my grip, closed my eyes, listened, and waited.
The prayers grew louder.
The cries in response to the prayers grew louder as well.
The organ started playing, intertwining with the sound of the dirge.
As the heat wave swept through, the sweat in the palms became even more bitter.
My hand clenched tighter, I didn't want to be abandoned by God.
My eyes closed even tighter, I didn't want to see the essence taken away, leaving behind the dregs.
Suddenly, a voice echoed overhead: "Amen."
It's over.
I looked at the clock.
Midnight has passed.
I looked at the elder believers, their savior did not come, they were too proud to show even a hint of disappointment, their faith was too deep, too long, and now it's too late to doubt.
But I felt angry for them.
They were deceived, misled, and confused, yet I still followed them and fell for it together.
I made the same prayer as they did, trying hard to resist the desires in my heart.
Not once, but twice, I plunged into that chilling baptismal pool.
I used to believe.
What should we do now?
I went home and turned on the TV, just in time to catch Peter Jennings announcing the new millennium, with the whole world celebrating the New Year.
I suddenly realized, no matter how I think about it, it's strange - Jesus is supposed to come again and again to different places just because of different time zones.
This made me feel even more uncomfortable in my heart, quite hurt, really.
But on that night, I did not stop believing.
I just believed in one other thing: that "not believing is also possible."
It is very likely that the answers I know are all wrong, and it is very likely that the question itself is wrong.
Now, the once towering peak of faith, with a spring flowing all the way to the foot of the mountain, a spring of questioning, it is destined to become a great river.
All the dramatic stories in my life can be traced back to that night in the church when my savior did not come; the things I was so sure of, if not called "lies", are at least not truths.
Although most of you welcomed the millennium in different ways, I believe you are here because some of you have done the same thing as me, the things that happened after the beginning of the new century, after my mother passed away, after my father left home, after my savior did not come.
I reached out my hands, desperately searching for something to believe in.
When I arrived at Yale University at the age of 18, I searched, believing that coming all the way from a small town in Texas, I had the opportunity to break free from all the hardships and difficulties I had experienced, to break free from those shattered dreams, and disabled body.
But when I returned to my hometown during winter break, with my head pressed to the ground, hands tightly bound behind my back, a robber's gun against my head, I knew that even the best education couldn't save me.
When I interned at Lehman Brothers in 2008, I was also searching.
Filled with hope - I excitedly called my family, saying we will never be poor again.
But when I watched as this financial temple crumbled before my eyes, I knew that even the best job couldn't save me.
When I worked as a young journalist in Washington, D.C., I searched, I heard a voice from Illinois: (referring to Obama's campaign speech) "It's been too long," "but in this election, America will embrace change."
But when the parliamentary work came to a complete standstill, the country was on the brink of disintegration, and the so-called hope and change turned into cruel jokes, I knew that even a political rebirth couldn't save me.
I knelt devoutly before the altar of the American Dream, praying to the great figures of the era, seeking success, seeking money, seeking power.
But every time, when the midnight bell tolls, I open my eyes and see that all these myths have died.
From this grave, I once again begin to search, not because I am brave, but because I know that if I have no faith, I will die.
So I went to another sacred place to worship, Harvard Business School - this time, I knew I couldn't simply accept the redemption offered by the school.
No, I know I have more things to do.
It all started in a dark corner of a crowded party, on a late night in the harsh early winter of Massachusetts, where I and three friends asked a question that many young people with real aspirations have been asking for a long time: "How about we go on a road trip?"
We didn't know where to go or how to get there, but we knew we had to set out.
Because what we have been yearning for all our lives, as Jack Kerouac wrote: "To slip off into the endless night, and disappear into the distant horizon." Go out and see what people across the country are doing.
So even though there were voices of opposition, saying that we were taking too big of a risk and wouldn't gain anything, we still set out.
In the summer of 2013, we traveled 13,000 kilometers across the United States, passing through the dairy farms of Montana, the abandoned urban areas of Detroit, and the swamp wetlands of New Orleans. We found some people there, worked for them, and their small businesses, making achieving goals the bottom line.
After studying at the "West Point of Capitalism," we realized that this idea was truly revolutionary.
This idea spread and eventually grew into a non-profit organization called "Masters in Management Travel Across America," which is also the main reason I can stand on the stage today.
It can spread because we found a strong desire among this generation, a desire to achieve goals and life values.
It can spread because we have found countless entrepreneurs in the corners of the United States, who create jobs, change lives, and just need a little help.
But to be honest, it can spread because I have been tirelessly spreading it. In order to spread this gospel,
There is nothing I wouldn't do to make more people believe that we can heal the wounds of this broken country, relying on one small business at a time.
But it is this process of spreading the gospel that led me to a slightly different gospel, which I am going to share with you today.
It all began about a year ago one evening, at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, attending a Harvard Business School alumni dinner.
Underneath a full-size model of a whale, I sat side by side with the giants of this era, praising their companions and their great achievements.
The room was filled with a sense of pride, as the total assets owned by these individuals amounted to over five trillion US dollars.
We looked down upon all creation, feeling that this was good.
However, things happened this way: two days later, I went to Harlem in New York, sitting in a city farm that used to be an abandoned parking lot, listening to a man named Tony talk about some children who would go there every day.
They are all below the poverty line.
Many people packed all their belongings in their backpacks, fearing that they would be stolen in the shelter.
Some people come to Tony's farm, named "Harlem Growth," to get their only meal of the day.
Tony told me that he started "Harlem Growth" relying on his own pension, after working as a taxi driver for 20 years.
He said he didn't leave himself a penny because, although the project was considered successful, resources were still extremely scarce.
He said that he would accept any help he could find.
And I am going to help him.
But when I left Tony, a pang of pain pierced my heart, tears moistening the corners of my eyes.
I felt the burden of enlightenment, as one night I could sit in a room and chat about a better world with hundreds of people worth five trillion US dollars. However, in another room two days later, only 50 blocks away, a man without a salary had to provide the only meal of the day for his children.
However, it is not this glaring social inequality that brings tears to my eyes, nor is it these hungry, homeless children, nor the anger towards the 1%, or the compassion towards the 99%.
No, my heart cannot be calm because I finally realize that this country needs a complete transformation, and I am just making minor repairs.
I realized that my story represents a group of people, people who hope that they can help themselves, even if they are penniless; what my organization represents is all the basic, systematic help, but it has never reached Harlem, or the Appalachian Mountains, and the Ninth Ward of New Orleans; my cries represent some voices, those that sound meaningless, unadorned, and out of place.
And this sense of shame, this sense of shame washed over me, just like the shame of sitting in front of the television, watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium, once, twice, and again.
I was deceived, fooled, and misled,
But this time, the hypocritical savior is myself.
You know, I have walked all the way from that altar, that night I felt the world was about to end, walking from a small town using various dialects, thinking that suffering is a gift from God to mankind, even treating it as a creed, as eternal truth.
Yes, my journey has been too long, to the point that I have circled back to the starting point.
Because we cannot simply generalize and say that this era lacks faith. No, we are believing in something just like any other time in history.
Some people may believe in the prophecies of Brin Brown or Tony Robbins. We may believe in the maxims of The New Yorker or Harvard Business Review.
We may believe intensely in the things we worship in the TED church, but we desperately need faith.
We imitate the charismatic leaders' words and actions, who promise to solve all human problems.
We feel that suffering is a gift from the capitalist "God" to us, we treat technological development as a creed, as eternal truth.
But we never realized the humanitarian cost we paid, we would not question a brick, because we are afraid the whole building will collapse.
But when you feel uneasy about these things that go against nature that we take for granted, the time for questioning will surely come.
So the gospel I spread is not about breakthroughs, innovation, or sustainable development.
I have no gospel of faith to share with anyone.
The only gospel I have is the gospel of questioning.
The gospel of questioning does not ask you to stop believing; it asks you to believe in something new: "It is possible not to believe."
It is very likely that the answers we know are all wrong, and it is very likely that the questions themselves are wrong.
Yes, the gospel of questioning may mean that our existence, on this stage, in this room, is all wrong.
Because it raises a question: "Why?"
With such powerful resources in our hands, why are there still people in dire straits?
This questioning led me to make a decision to shut down the organization I founded, "Masters in Management Travel Across America."
We have disbanded the staff, closed down for good, and opened up this model to everyone, as long as they feel capable of doing it, without needing our approval.
This questioning forced me to take off the "savior" hat that others had placed on my head because our lives are too short, the chances are too low, and we simply cannot wait for the Second Coming of Christ. The truth is, there are no miracles in this world.
And this questioning, it drives me, it gives me hope, when difficulties are about to overwhelm us, when the path of fate seems to lead us astray, when our savior cannot heal the wounds, it is not our blind faith, but our simple questioning, that will shed a little light into the darkness of our lives and the world. Let us speak softly,
Shouting works too, or to put it simply, very simply: "Definitely, there is another way."
Thank you.
