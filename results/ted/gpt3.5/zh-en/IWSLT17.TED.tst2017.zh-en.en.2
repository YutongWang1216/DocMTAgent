I come from one of the most free, tolerant, and promising cities in the United States, Seattle, Washington.
I grew up in a great Seattle family.
My mother is an artist, my father is a university professor, and I am grateful for their upbringing, as I can completely plan my life freely in a way that feels right to me.
In reality, my choices are quite different from what my parents had in mind.
When I was 19 years old, I dropped out of college - or more accurately, I was expelled.
I embarked on the path of becoming a professional French horn player, which is my lifelong dream.
I performed chamber music in the United States and Europe, touring for several years with the excellent jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd.
In my twenties, I was thrilled to join the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a wonderful life!
And my parents have never complained.
They have supported me throughout.
Even though that was not their dream.
They used to tell neighbors and friends, "Our son is going to take a 'break' for ten years."
As well as a conversation about my embarrassing life that I want to share with you.
I was 27 years old at that time, I returned home from Barcelona, and it was Christmas Day. I went home to visit my parents, and when I was helping my mother cook dinner, there were only the two of us in the kitchen.
She was silent at that time, not saying a word.
I feel that something is not quite right.
I asked my mother, "Mom, what are you thinking about?"
She said, "Your father and I are really worried about you."
I was surprised: "What? What is there to worry about now?"
She replied, "I hope you answer my question honestly: Did you vote for the Republican Party?"
The fact is, I have no interest in politics, I am just a French horn player.
But I started to understand a little, they noticed something, so they were a bit confused.
At that time, I became a fervent supporter of capitalism, let me tell you why.
Believe it or not, it stems from my lifelong study of poverty.
When I was still a child in Seattle, I remember that was the first time I encountered real poverty.
My family belonged to the lower middle class, but that was certainly not real poverty.
Not at all.
The first time I saw the true face of poverty was in the early 1970s when I was only six or seven years old.
Like many of us, this example is very ordinary and common.
It was a painting in National Geographic, depicting children of similar age to me in a country in East Africa, with flies buzzing around their faces and their bellies swollen.
I knew he couldn't make it through, I knew it, but I was powerless.
Some of you may remember such a painting, not necessarily identical, but a very similar one.
It shows the Western world the unbearable poverty in other parts of the world.
The image lingered in my mind as I grew up, went to school, dropped out, and started to build my own family.
I really want to know, what happened to that child later on?
Or what happened to people like him in other parts of the world?
I began to study this issue, even though I was no longer in college at the time, I was still searching for answers: What happened to the world's poorest people?
Did it get worse, or did it get better? What actually happened?
I eventually found the answer and changed my life. I want to share it with you.
In fact, most Americans feel that from childhood, from the moment they saw that scene until now,
Poverty has worsened. If you were to ask Americans, "Has the global poverty issue worsened or improved?" 70% of people would say that hunger issues have worsened since the early 1970s.
However, the reality is like this.
This was a moment that changed my thinking and enlightened me.
Since 1970, the percentage of the world's population living on less than $1 per day, adjusted for inflation, has decreased by 80%.
The percentage of the world's poorest people has decreased by 80% from when I was a child until now.
But I was not aware of this fact.
My friends, this is a miracle!
This is something worth celebrating.
This is the greatest achievement in human history in the fight against poverty, and it happened in our lifetime.
When I learned of this fact, I thought, what makes it possible to escape poverty?
Because if you don't know the reason, it will just be a flash in the pan.
We want to replicate success, to help the 2 billion people still struggling in poverty break free from their current situation, because that is the issue we have been talking about all along: from when I was still a child, the 2 billion poorest people, our brothers and sisters, have escaped poverty.
I hope to save the remaining 2 billion people, so I must know the reason.
I am searching for the answers,
It is not a political answer, because I don't care about political solutions at all.
Now, still don't care.
I yearn to obtain the best answers from mainstream economists, whether they are left-wing, right-wing, or centrist economists.
Next
I began to talk about specific reasons.
From childhood to now, 2 billion people have escaped poverty.
There are five reasons. First: globalization.
Second: free trade.
Third: property rights.
Fourth: rule of law
Fifth: entrepreneurial spirit
These are brought about by the global free market economic system that swept the world after 1970.
I am not naive.
I know that the free market economy is not perfect, and I also know that the free market economy cannot meet all of our needs to build a better world.
But it is great.
And it transcends politics.
This is something I have learned and realized.
Capitalism is not just the accumulation of capital.
Its greatness lies in: it is related to aspirations, as many people on this stage have mentioned, it is aspirations born from dreams, rooted in the free market system.
We must make more people understand this.
Now, I want to talk about my second realization. It is related to the first one. I believe it will not only promote the development of the world but also promote the development of our country.
In summary, the viewpoint just discussed on lifting people out of poverty can be encapsulated in one sentence from someone else: "The free market has created the most wealth in history."
And enabling billions of people to escape poverty.
Whose quote?
Such as Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
Wrong!
It's President Obama!
Why do I remember so vividly?
Because he was the one who told me.
Surprising, isn't it?
I said at the time, "Hallelujah!"
Not only that, I also said, "What a fantastic opportunity."
Do you know what I was thinking at that time?
In May 2015, we held an event at Georgetown University about the topic we were working on.
At that time, I thought about the solution to the biggest issue facing the United States today. What is it?
Whether liberal or conservative, coming together to discuss these ideas helps those who need our help the most.
It goes without saying that everyone present knows that we are in a crisis, in the United States and in other politically divided countries around the world.
This issue is becoming increasingly urgent.
This inevitably causes great concern.
Last year, an article was published in one of the most influential and cutting-edge scientific journals in the West, the National Academy of Sciences Journal.
That was an article from 2014 about asymmetric political motives.
What is it? Psychologists describe this phenomenon as assuming that your ideological beliefs are based on love while the other party's ideological beliefs are based on hatred.
This is very common in world disputes.
For example, between the Palestinians and Israelis.
The author of this article discovered that in present-day United States, there is a significant divide between a large portion of Republicans and Democrats in terms of political motivations.
Nowadays, the majority of politically active people in our country believe that they are driven by love, while the rest are driven by hatred.
Just think about it.
Most people always say: "My ideological foundation is love, I want to help people, while another part of people, they are evil, they are trying to overthrow me."
A society with such divisions cannot progress.
This is impossible.
How do we solve this problem?
First, let's be honest: divisions exist.
We cannot reduce divisions because that is childish behavior.
There is quite a lot of in-depth research on this.
My friend Jonathan Haidt is a frequent guest at TED.
He is a psychology professor at New York University.
He studies the thoughts, values, and moral views of different people, researching the differences they have.
He proved that conservatives and liberals have very different views on what they consider important.
For example, Jonathan Haidt pointed out that liberals care more about poverty than economic freedom by over 59%.
Conservatives care more about economic freedom than poverty by 28%.
Seems like irreconcilable differences, right?
Can we not come together? No!
Our strength lies precisely in our differences.
Remember what has stopped poverty:
It is the obsession and concern for poverty issues, along with the global free market economic order.
We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people, if we want to help another 2 billion people out of poverty.
There is no other way.
Hmm.
What should we do?
This is a very subtle matter, isn't it?
We need to innovate our thinking.
Many innovative ideas are right here on this stage.
Yes! Those extraordinary entrepreneurial spirits in society.
We need to invest overseas in a sustainable, responsible, and ethically moral manner.
But do you know what we truly need?
We need to open up a new world of flexible thinking,
We need less "predictability",
Right?
Have you ever felt that your thoughts are becoming predictable?
Starting to follow the rules?
Have you ever felt that you always listen to people who agree with your opinions?
Why is that dangerous?
Because when we talk about the economy in this country, on one side are conservatives, always discussing taxes, regulations, and the rule of big government.
While on the other side are liberals, always talking about income inequality when it comes to the economy.
Right? All of those are indeed very important, important to me, and important to you all.
But when those who are starving need our help, all of these are just distractions.
We should unite in the best way possible, do our best to reduce poverty, only when conservatives realize that they need liberals' concerns about poverty, and liberals also need conservatives' obsession with the free market,
We will only succeed. Only by choosing this path, will this diversity nurture the strong power of future nations.
How do we achieve this goal? How do we collectively achieve it?
I have some practical suggestions, for you all, as well as for myself.
First rule of action: Remember, merely tolerating others' differing opinions is not good enough,
Far from enough.
We must remember that we need to work with those who disagree with us, because there is a group of people who need help from all of us, and they are still waiting.
How do you plan to do it? How will you perform?
Where do we start? Right here!
All of us here, we are all fortunate.
We have people who listen to us,
We are very successful, we have leadership.
When people hear our unknown ideological thoughts, perhaps then they will listen to us.
Perhaps this is the starting point of success.
This is the first point. The second.
Second point: I am asking you all, as well as myself, to become specific individuals with blurred boundaries, to become a vague and indefinable person.
If you are a conservative, then be a conservative who frequently mentions poverty issues, and be a warrior who insists on fulfilling the moral obligation to fight for the poor.
If you are a liberal, then be a liberal who frequently praises the charm of the free market operating responsibly under our watch.
If we do that, the two goals will be within reach.
First, we start to dedicate ourselves to helping the next 2 billion people solve problems like we have in the past, and in the future, we will solve even more. This is what we can achieve.
Second, perhaps we can overcome the terrible ideological war that has caused us suffering, and transform it into a competition based on unity and mutual respect.
Perhaps at that time, just possibly, we may find that our so-called differences are not so irreconcilable after all.
Thank you!
