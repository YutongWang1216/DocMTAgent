High school teacher Paul Barnwell's article on teaching students to give speeches without notes is mentioned as an example. The author stresses the significance of maintaining coherent conversations and provides tips on how to have better conversations by focusing on interviewing skills, avoiding boredom, and not offending others. The key message is to engage in conversations with an open mind, listen, and learn from others, rather than acting like a know-it-all. Additionally, using open-ended questions and going with the flow of ideas during conversations is crucial for successful communication.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "In today's world, where polite conversations are increasingly challenging due to arguments and extremism, the importance of communication skills is emphasized. High school teacher Paul Barnwell's article on teaching students to give speeches without notes is mentioned as an example. The author stresses the significance of maintaining coherent conversations and provides tips on how to have better conversations by focusing on interviewing skills, avoiding boredom, and not offending others. The key message is to engage in conversations with an open mind, listen, and learn from others, rather than acting like a know-it-all. Additionally, using open-ended questions and going with the flow of ideas during conversations is crucial for successful communication. The paragraph also emphasizes the importance of being mindful of what you say in conversations, advising against letting negative thoughts linger, claiming expertise without certainty, comparing experiences with others, self-promotion, repeating oneself, and talking nonsense. It stresses the need to be cautious, responsible, and considerate in communication.",

        "new_src_summary": "本文探讨了现代社交中存在的沟通障碍和偏激现象，强调了交流能力在现代社会的重要性。作者提到了在社交媒体上拉黑好友的情况，以及人们因为不愿意和某些人交谈而避开。随着社会气候的变化和偏激情绪的增加，人们变得更加不愿意妥协和倾听对方，导致交流失衡。同时，作者分享了自己作为职业访谈者的经验，并提出了10条基本规则来帮助人们提高交流能力。此外，文段还讨论了两个主要观点：专注于当下，避免心不在焉，以及避免自以为是，开放倾听并学习。建议使用开放式问题来开启对话，让对方描述情境，得到更有意思的回答。同时，强调顺其自然地表达想法，避免在交谈中不停地思考下一个问题而错过了对方的讲述。另外，文段也强调了在交谈中的谨慎和尊重他人的重要性，不要让负面想法过多地在头脑中逗留，要诚实承认自己不知道的事情，避免将自己的经历和他人比较，不要重复自己的话，少说废话。同时，这段文段也强调了倾听的重要性。作者指出，别人并不在乎我们，而是关注我们是什么样的人，以及我们有什么共同点。作者强调认真倾听是一种可以提升的重要技能，引用了佛言和柯立芝的名言来支持这一观点。作者解释了为什么人们更喜欢说而不愿倾听，包括控制和干扰等原因。最后，作者强调了倾听是交谈的关键，而不仅仅是两个人在同一个地方说毫不相关的话。整体风格严肃但不严厉，既警示又鼓励，呼吁人们重视交流的重要性，并通过学习如何开始一段交谈，不浪费时间，不感到无聊，并避免冒犯他人，建立真实的连接。",
        "new_tgt_summary": "In today's world, where polite conversations are increasingly challenging due to arguments and extremism, the importance of communication skills is emphasized. High school teacher Paul Barnwell's article on teaching students to give speeches without notes is mentioned as an example. The author stresses the significance of maintaining coherent conversations and provides tips on how to have better conversations by focusing on interviewing skills, avoiding boredom, and not offending others. The key message is to engage in conversations with an open mind, listen, and learn from others, rather than acting like a know-it-all. Additionally, using open-ended questions and going with the flow of ideas during conversations is crucial for successful communication. The paragraph also emphasizes the importance of being mindful of what you say in conversations, advising against letting negative thoughts linger, claiming expertise without certainty, comparing experiences with others, self-promotion, repeating oneself, and talking nonsense. It stresses the need to be cautious, responsible, and considerate in communication. The paragraph also emphasizes the importance of listening in conversations, with examples from the Buddha and Calvin Coolidge. It highlights the tendency for people to prefer speaking over listening, as it gives them a sense of control and identity. The paragraph also points out that distractions can prevent individuals from truly paying attention to what others are saying, leading to ineffective communication. Ultimately, the paragraph stresses the importance of actively listening in order to have meaningful conversations.",
