Hello everyone
My name is Matthew Williams, and I am a champion.
I have won medals in three different sports and at the Canada Games. I have participated in international level basketball projects, and I am very proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I train basketball and speed skating with top coaches and sports psychologists five days a week to maintain the best competitive condition.
To add on, all of these are because of the Special Olympics.
Has this changed your perception of me and my achievements at all?
This world does not consider everyone like me as champions.
Not long ago, people like me were not treated well.
Since the Special Olympics began in 1968, this phenomenon has greatly improved, but in reality, it is still common to see intellectually disabled individuals being overlooked compared to ordinary people.
People call me "stupid" in front of me, thinking that I don't care.
They call me "idiot" and say I am slow, which is completely derogatory.
They don't know how much this hurts me and my friends.
I don't want you to think that I am here to seek pity.
I am here because this issue still exists: there are still many people who have problematic views towards intellectually disabled individuals, or even more, many people simply do not acknowledge their existence.
Do you all know that the World Games are being held this year?
I am one of the 6,500 intellectually disabled athletes. We come from 165 countries and are competing in Los Angeles.
At that time, there were over 62,000 spectators watching the opening ceremony, and TSN and ESPN also broadcasted it.
But do you know about this?
When you see people like me, what do you think?
I came here today to boldly propose that we treat each other equally.
The Special Olympics has changed the self-awareness of intellectually disabled athletes and also changed the perception of the audience.
If you are not familiar with the Special Olympics, let me explain - it is designed for intellectually disabled individuals.
It is separate from the Paralympics and the Olympics.
We have high-quality, year-round sports programs specifically designed for intellectually disabled athletes. These programs can change our destiny and our perception of ourselves.
The Special Olympics has changed my life, as well as the lives of many others, and has also changed the way the world views intellectually disabled individuals.
I was born with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities.
Before the age of 12, I had always been playing field hockey.
The older I get, the more difficult it becomes to keep up with others. I feel angry and frustrated.
For a period of time, I had no contact with any sports, not many friends, and felt abandoned, with no one paying attention.
There was a time when intellectually disabled individuals were isolated and not openly accepted by society.
No one would think that they can also participate in sports, let alone become a valuable member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was researching the impact of regular exercise on the health of intellectually disabled children.
Dr. Hayden and other researchers have come to a conclusion through rigorous scientific research: the reason for the declining health of intellectually disabled children is simply the lack of opportunities for exercise.
Many people doubt that intellectually disabled individuals can benefit from sports programs or athletic competitions.
But it is precisely because of Dr. Hayden, as well as the founder of the Special Olympics, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, that they advocate the benefits of sports, and Special Olympics athletes have proven the benefits of sports more than four and a half million times.
Before I participated in the Special Olympics, I was an easily nervous person because I was young, shy, lacked confidence, and didn't have many friends.
But when I arrived there, I found that everyone was very friendly, helpful, and did not discriminate against me, allowing me to be myself.
Now, I am a basketball player and a speed skating athlete, having participated in provincial and national competitions, and this year I also participated in the Summer Special Olympics in Los Angeles. There, I represented the first Canadian basketball player to compete in the World Games.
I am a part of the four and a half million athletes in the world, and I have also heard many similar stories.
Being a Special Olympics athlete helps us regain our confidence and dignity.
This event also highlighted important health needs.
Studies have shown that, on average, intellectually disabled men live 13 years less than men without intellectual disabilities, while intellectually disabled women live 20 years less than women without intellectual disabilities.
The Special Olympics help us stay healthy and actively engage in sports.
Our coaches also teach us about nutrition and health.
The Special Olympics also provide free health check-ups for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctors or have difficulty accessing health care.
At the 2015 Summer Special Olympics, my Canadian team members and I competed against the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the game, members of the Nigerian basketball team participated in the health system check-up at the sports event. Out of the 10 players, 7 of them received free hearing aids, hearing clearly for the first time in their lives.
The changes brought to them are truly astonishing.
They became more excited, happy, and confident because their coach could finally communicate with them in language.
They were very excited because they could hear the sound of basketball, the whistle, and the cheers of the fans standing by, the sounds that we take for granted.
The Special Olympics not only change them in terms of their athletic abilities, but also in other aspects.
It also changes them in terms of their personal lives.
This year, research shows that nearly half of adults in the United States do not know anyone with an intellectual disability. 44% of Americans who have not had contact with individuals with intellectual disabilities are significantly less tolerant and have a less positive attitude.
Words containing the word "idiot" further prove that intellectually disabled individuals are still being ignored and feel isolated from the world.
People use this word either casually or as an insult.
Last year, on Twitter, it was used over nine million times, deeply hurting me and my 4.5 million athlete companions in this world.
People don't think they are insulting anyone, but they actually are.
My athlete companion and global messenger, Franklin Stevens, wrote a letter to a political commentator who had used the word "stupid" as an insult, inviting them to come and see the Special Olympics.
See if you still have the same thoughts when you leave."
This year, at the 2015 Summer Special Olympics, people lined up for hours just to watch the weightlifting competition on the final night.
When my teammate Jackie Barrett took the field, people stood up. He was known as the Newfoundland Caribou. He deadlifted 665 pounds and squatted and lifted 611 pounds, setting multiple new records for the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the record holder among weightlifters in Newfoundland, not just in the Special Olympics, but among all weightlifters.
Jackie is now a big star in Los Angeles, with ESPN even tweeting in real-time about his record-breaking weightlifting performance and being amazed by his performance.
50 years ago, almost no one could imagine that individuals with intellectual disabilities could achieve this.
This year, sixty thousand spectators filled the famous Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena to watch the opening ceremony of the competition and cheer for athletes from 165 countries around the world.
We are congratulated and cheered for, rather than being hidden away.
The Special Olympics teach athletes to be more confident and proud of themselves.
The Special Olympics also teach the world that individuals with intellectual disabilities deserve to be respected and included.
Now, in my sports career, I have dreams and achievements, receive good training, respect, live a healthier life, and I am also working towards a career as a personal coach.
I am no longer hidden or bullied. I am here at TED giving a TED Talk.
With the Special Olympics, the world has changed, but there is still a long way to go.
So the next time you see someone with an intellectual disability, I hope you can see their potential.
Next time someone uses the word "stupid" around you, I hope you will tell them how hurtful that word can be.
I hope you will want to watch a Special Olympics event.
Lastly, I would like to share one more idea with everyone.
Nelson Mandela once said, "Sport has the power to change the world."
The Special Olympics are changing the world, changing the lives of 4.5 million athletes, giving us a place to be confident, make friends, avoid discrimination, and experience being a champion.
Thank you, everyone!
