Genetically modified foods are proposed as a solution, but concerns about their environmental impact, specifically genetically modified agricultural wastewater, are raised. The author questions the lack of influence in current discussions on the food crisis and highlights the lengthy process of getting apples from picking to stores, including the potential dangers of entering refrigerated warehouses. Additionally, the paragraph addresses the loss of nutrients in apples by the time they are purchased, the lack of awareness about this issue, and the potential benefits of a platform for sharing information and ideas about food production and distribution. It also considers the impact of climate on agricultural production and suggests that having climates suitable for each country's production could improve the quality of food and life.",

Genetically modified foods are suggested as a solution, but concerns about their environmental impact, including genetically modified agricultural wastewater, are raised. The lack of influence in current discussions on the food crisis is questioned, along with the lengthy process of getting apples from picking to stores and the potential dangers of entering refrigerated warehouses. The loss of nutrients in apples by the time they are purchased is addressed, as well as the lack of awareness about this issue. The potential benefits of a platform for sharing information and ideas about food production and distribution are considered, along with the impact of climate on agricultural production. Additionally, challenges faced in agriculture globally, such as the lack of young people and resources in countries like Japan, America, Africa, and India, are discussed. The idea of digitizing food production and the difficulties in small-scale farming are also touched upon, highlighting the need for innovation and solutions in the agricultural sector to address these issues.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The global food crisis is examined, with regions experiencing scarcity while others have abundant food production. Concerns about the environmental impact of genetically modified foods, including genetically modified agricultural wastewater, are raised. The lack of influence in current discussions on the food crisis is questioned, along with the challenges faced in agriculture globally, such as the lack of young people and resources in countries like Japan, America, Africa, and India. The potential benefits of a platform for sharing information and ideas about food production and distribution are considered, along with the impact of climate on agricultural production. The speaker reflects on the exodus of young people to the city and the need to create a platform to encourage them. They share their experience of experimenting with connecting plants to a computer, ultimately developing a close relationship with them. The speaker and their team built a farm in a media lab, using interesting technologies to produce enough food for approximately 300 people for one month, with the most interesting aspect being the harvest of beautiful, white roots and deep green plants once a month.",

The lack of influence in current discussions on the food crisis and challenges in agriculture globally are discussed, emphasizing the need for a platform to share information and ideas. The speaker shares their experience of connecting plants to a computer in a media lab, where they developed a farm using innovative technologies to produce food for approximately 300 people for one month. The modern approach to plant cultivation in the lab involves studying plants with experts in image processing, data science, and robotics, focusing on unique taste under pressure and exploring plant physiology to create new varieties. The lab utilizes sensor points for each plant and delves into genomics and genetics to understand plant growth. Farmers can control and manipulate plant growth through programming and sensors, predicting plant health and growth based on climate conditions and nutrient levels. Data is collected and combined with individual plants, giving each plant a traceable IP address for monitoring and communication.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The global food crisis is examined, focusing on disparities in food production and concerns about genetically modified foods. The lack of influence in current discussions on the food crisis and challenges in agriculture globally are discussed, emphasizing the need for a platform to share information and ideas. The speaker shares their experience of connecting plants to a computer in a media lab, where they developed a farm using innovative technologies to produce food for approximately 300 people for one month. The modern approach to plant cultivation in the lab involves studying plants with experts in image processing, data science, and robotics, focusing on unique taste under pressure and exploring plant physiology to create new varieties. The lab utilizes sensor points for each plant and delves into genomics and genetics to understand plant growth. Farmers can control and manipulate plant growth through programming and sensors, predicting plant health and growth based on climate conditions and nutrient levels. Data is collected and combined with individual plants, giving each plant a traceable IP address for monitoring and communication. Additionally, the paragraph discusses the idea of plants becoming Facebook users and making friends based on their nutrient needs. The speaker's background in data center design for hospitals has led to the development of a controlled environment for plant cultivation. The aeroponic system used provides plants with water, minerals, and oxygen, resulting in faster growth. The speaker believes in creating a perfect world through technological advancements and growing rare and ancient plants in a seed bank.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The global food crisis is examined, highlighting disparities in food production and concerns about genetically modified foods. The lack of influence in current discussions on the food crisis and challenges in agriculture globally are discussed, emphasizing the need for a platform to share information and ideas. The speaker shares their experience of connecting plants to a computer in a media lab, where they developed a farm using innovative technologies to produce food for approximately 300 people for one month. The modern approach to plant cultivation in the lab involves studying plants with experts in image processing, data science, and robotics, focusing on unique taste under pressure and exploring plant physiology to create new varieties. The lab utilizes sensor points for each plant and delves into genomics and genetics to understand plant growth. Farmers can control and manipulate plant growth through programming and sensors, predicting plant health and growth based on climate conditions and nutrient levels. Data is collected and combined with individual plants, giving each plant a traceable IP address for monitoring and communication. Additionally, the paragraph discusses the idea of plants becoming Facebook users and making friends based on their nutrient needs. The speaker's background in data center design for hospitals has led to the development of a controlled environment for plant cultivation. The aeroponic system used provides plants with water, minerals, and oxygen, resulting in faster growth. The speaker believes in creating a perfect world through technological advancements and growing rare and ancient plants in a seed bank. The challenges of growing and cooking sauce tomatoes are also discussed, along with the development of expensive tools for this purpose. The speaker and his student, Camille, worked on making the tools cheaper and more user-friendly, bringing them to a school to teach children how to operate them. One student's lack of understanding led to a humorous interaction about humidity levels.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The global food crisis is examined, focusing on disparities in food production and concerns about genetically modified foods. The lack of influence in current discussions on the food crisis and challenges in agriculture globally are discussed, emphasizing the need for a platform to share information and ideas. The speaker shares their experience of connecting plants to a computer in a media lab, using innovative technologies to produce food for approximately 300 people for one month. The modern approach to plant cultivation in the lab involves studying plants with experts in image processing, data science, and robotics, focusing on unique taste under pressure and exploring plant physiology to create new varieties. The lab utilizes sensor points for each plant and delves into genomics and genetics to understand plant growth. Farmers can control and manipulate plant growth through programming and sensors, predicting plant health and growth based on climate conditions and nutrient levels. Data is collected and combined with individual plants, giving each plant a traceable IP address for monitoring and communication. The paragraph also discusses the creation of a 3D environment interface in a school, allowing children to experiment with different recipes for growing plants and learn about the importance of carbon dioxide for plant growth. The project, referred to as a \"food computer,\" involves iterative design, development, and exploration, with the ability to download data on the new plants and recipes created during a three-week cultivation period.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The global food crisis is examined, focusing on disparities in food production and concerns about genetically modified foods. The lack of influence in current discussions on the food crisis and challenges in agriculture globally are discussed, emphasizing the need for a platform to share information and ideas. The speaker shares their experience of connecting plants to a computer in a media lab, using innovative technologies to produce food for approximately 300 people for one month. The modern approach to plant cultivation in the lab involves studying plants with experts in image processing, data science, and robotics, focusing on unique taste under pressure and exploring plant physiology to create new varieties. The lab utilizes sensor points for each plant and delves into genomics and genetics to understand plant growth. Farmers can control and manipulate plant growth through programming and sensors, predicting plant health and growth based on climate conditions and nutrient levels. Data is collected and combined with individual plants, giving each plant a traceable IP address for monitoring and communication. The paragraph also discusses the creation of a 3D environment interface in a school, allowing children to experiment with different recipes for growing plants and learn about the importance of carbon dioxide for plant growth. The project, referred to as a \"food computer,\" involves iterative design, development, and exploration, with the ability to download data on the new plants and recipes created during a three-week cultivation period. The importance of making resources available for individuals interested in farming and technology, particularly in the development of food computers, is highlighted. The team working on this project includes farmers, engineers, scientists, and planners who collaborate to build experimental equipment and warehouses for growing plants, including those producing proteins to combat the Ebola virus. The project is seen as successful and innovative in its approach to farming and research.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The global food crisis is examined, focusing on disparities in food production and concerns about genetically modified foods. The lack of influence in current discussions on the food crisis and challenges in agriculture globally are discussed, emphasizing the need for a platform to share information and ideas. The speaker shares their experience of connecting plants to a computer in a media lab, using innovative technologies to produce food for approximately 300 people for one month. The modern approach to plant cultivation in the lab involves studying plants with experts in image processing, data science, and robotics, focusing on unique taste under pressure and exploring plant physiology to create new varieties. The lab utilizes sensor points for each plant and delves into genomics and genetics to understand plant growth. Farmers can control and manipulate plant growth through programming and sensors, predicting plant health and growth based on climate conditions and nutrient levels. Data is collected and combined with individual plants, giving each plant a traceable IP address for monitoring and communication. The paragraph also discusses the creation of a 3D environment interface in a school, allowing children to experiment with different recipes for growing plants and learn about the importance of carbon dioxide for plant growth. The project, referred to as a \"food computer,\" involves iterative design, development, and exploration, with the ability to download data on the new plants and recipes created during a three-week cultivation period. The importance of making resources available for individuals interested in farming and technology, particularly in the development of food computers, is highlighted. The team working on this project includes farmers, engineers, scientists, and planners who collaborate to build experimental equipment and warehouses for growing plants, including those producing proteins to combat the Ebola virus. The paragraph also discusses the changing landscape of the food industry, with a focus on the shift towards higher quality, environmentally friendly food. It mentions the emergence of individual food computers, servers, and data centers that connect people to share information about food. The paragraph also highlights the importance of collaboration in compiling climate recipes and the potential for a future where information about food is shared instead of physical food.",
