You may have never heard of Kailahun in Sierra Leone, or Arua in Nigeria.
But I think they are the two best places in the world.
In the hospital there, there is a community made up of nurses, surgeons, and scientists who have been quietly battling one of the deadliest threats to humanity for years - the Lassa virus.
The Lassa virus is very similar to the Ebola virus.
It can cause severe fever symptoms and is often deadly.
But these people risk their lives every day to protect every member of the community, while also protecting all of us.
The best thing I learned from them is that when I first visited many years ago, during those challenging days of frontline struggle, they started each day like this - by singing.
They gather together, fully displaying their joy.
They display a spirit.
Many years have passed, when we visit each other year after year, I can always gather with them to sing, and we will record these moments. We love doing this because it reminds us that we are not only exploring scientific truths together, but also bound by a common humanity.
And you can imagine, when changes occur around us, this connection becomes extremely important, even indispensable.
In March 2014, a huge change occurred. The Ebola epidemic broke out in Guinea.
This was the first outbreak of an epidemic in West Africa, occurring at the border between Sierra Leone and Liberia.
The situation is very terrible, and each of us is shocked.
In fact, we even once suspected that the spread of the Lassa and Ebola epidemics was wider than we imagined, and we were worried that one day it would spread to Kailahun.
So my team members immediately set off, arrived there, and joined Dr. Humar Khan and his team. We set up diagnostic equipment to perform some sensitive molecular tests, so that when the Ebola virus crosses the border of Sierra Leone, we can detect it.
We have long set up equipment of this scale for the Lassa virus, we know how to deal with it, this team is extremely outstanding.
We just need to provide them with equipment and a location for them to research Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day has come.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to the hospital's maternity ward, and our team conducted those important molecular tests, confirming the first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
This is actually very remarkable.
They can diagnose the condition in the first instance, treat patients safely, and begin tracking contacts to follow the spread of the disease.
It could have prevented something.
But when that day came, the outbreak of the epidemic had been brewing for several months.
After hundreds of cases were discovered, it made all previous outbreaks pale in comparison.
And the virus did not enter Sierra Leone through that single case; it was a huge shockwave.
We need to closely cooperate with the international community, the Ministry of Health, and the local authorities in Kailahun to address these cases. In the following week, 31 patients arrived, then 92, and later increased to 147 - all coming to Kailahun because it is one of the few places in Sierra Leone that can handle the epidemic.
We work tirelessly day and night, giving our all to help every patient, hoping to gain everyone's attention, but at the same time, we also did something else simple.
In order to detect the Ebola virus, we extracted samples from the patients' blood, of course, we could just discard them.
However, in fact, another thing we can do is to add chemical substances to inactivate the samples, then seal them in a box and transport them across the ocean. And that's exactly what we did.
We sent the samples to Boston, where my team works,
We also worked tirelessly day and night, rotating shifts every day, and as a result, we quickly sequenced the 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
This is a blueprint - the genome of the virus is a blueprint.
We humans also have it.
It details everything that makes up our bodies, telling us a lot of information.
The results of this work are simple, but also powerful.
We can take these 99 different virus mutations, observe and compare them. We can clearly see that, compared to the three genomes released by Guinea, we can find that the disease had already begun spreading in Guinea several months ago. Once it broke into the population, it would quickly spread through contact between people.
This information is actually crucial, especially when you are studying how to hinder the spread of the virus. But the most important thing is contact tracing.
We can also see that as the virus spreads between people, it continues to mutate.
Every mutation is extremely important because all diagnoses, vaccines, and the treatment methods we use are basically based on that specific genome sequence, which is the root cause of the epidemic spread.
Therefore, global health experts must respond quickly, improve research methods, and make adjustments to everything they do.
But from my perspective at the time, the method of scientific research was that I would receive the data, possibly have to be locked in the laboratory for several months, carefully analyze the data, write a paper and submit it, then revise it repeatedly, and finally publish the paper publicly so that the data can be made available.
This was the current state of scientific research at that time.
Well, at that specific time, this method definitely wouldn't work, right?
Some of our friends are working on the front lines of disease resistance, and obviously what we need most is help from the outside, a lot of help.
So the first thing we did was as soon as the gene sequencing results came out of the machine, we immediately posted this data online.
We made it public to the whole world, and then said, "Help us!"
Help came one after another.
Before we could even react, a large group of people from all over the world contacted us proactively, pleasantly surprised to see this data being made public online.
Some of the world's most outstanding virus trackers suddenly became members of our team!
We collaborate in this virtual way, sharing information, frequently calling each other, staying in touch, hoping to track the spread of the virus minute by minute, and then find ways to contain it.
In fact, there are many ways to assemble such a group.
Everyone, especially when the epidemic breaks out worldwide, is constantly seeking information and getting involved.
Everyone wants to make a contribution.
The power of people all over the world is truly amazing, and the Internet brings us together.
Can you imagine? We are no longer afraid to communicate with others, and all of us say, "Let's get to work."
Let's work together, we can definitely do it!"
However, the problem is that the data we all use, the data found on Google, is far from sufficient to meet our work needs.
When this situation occurs, we will miss out on many opportunities.
So in the early stages of the outbreak in Kailahun, we had clinical records for 106 patients, and once again, we made all of this public.
In our own laboratory, if you provide us with those 106 records, we can use computers to predict the next Ebola patients, with an accuracy rate close to 100%.
We also developed an application specifically for sharing these predictions, allowing healthcare workers worldwide to access this information.
But 106 reports are far from enough, and this method is still ineffective.
So we are waiting for more clinical reports before we can release that software,
And these reports still haven't arrived.
We are still waiting, continuously refining the software, holed up in the laboratory instead of collaborating with others.
This is... something we absolutely cannot accept.
Right? None of you, none of you can accept it.
Now is the moment when lives hang in the balance.
However, in reality, many people have sacrificed, including many healthcare workers, such as my esteemed colleagues, five of whom are: M'balu Fonnie, Alex Moeti, Dr. Humar Khan, Alice Kovoma, and Mohamed Fuller.
These are just five of the countless healthcare workers who sacrificed in Kailahun and elsewhere, while the world waited, and we continued to work diligently, isolated and without communication.
The Ebola virus, like other threats to humanity, will escalate due to distrust, division, and alienation among people.
When we build barriers and fight against each other, the virus becomes even more arrogant.
But Ebola is unlike other threats, because this time, we have become a family.
We are all on the same front line.
If one person contracts Ebola, we could be the next.
So we live in the world, with common weaknesses, common strengths, common fears, common hopes. I sincerely hope that we can work together with joy.
One of my former students read a book about Sierra Leone and came across the word "Kailahun," the name of the city and hospital where we worked in Sierra Leone. In the local Mende language, it means "transparent and clear like a river, with everyone's gaze reaching out."
This holds a very profound significance for us, which we ourselves may not realize, but we have always felt the need to pay tribute to everyone who has fought for Kailahun, the place we have struggled for. We must be open to collaboration, we must share information, and we must move forward together.
We must do this.
Everyone should demand this of themselves and others - when disaster strikes, we should all open our hearts to each other and fight this battle together.
Because this is not the first outbreak of the Ebola epidemic, nor will it be the last, there are many other microorganisms lurking around us, just like the Lassa virus and other organisms.
The next time a disaster occurs, it may happen in a city with a population of millions, and it may erupt there.
The virus may be transmitted through the air.
Viruses may even be intentionally spread by people.
I know this is scary, I understand, but I also know that this experience tells us that we have enough technology and capability to win this battle, not only to win this battle, but also to rise above all viruses.
But only when we cooperate sincerely can we achieve this, and we must do so with joy in our hearts.
So for Dr. Khan, and for all those who have sacrificed on the front lines of battling diseases, those who will always fight alongside us, let us also fight alongside them forever.
Our world should not be defined by the destruction caused by a virus; we must let the radiance of billions of hearts united in cooperation spread across the earth.
Thank you, everyone.
