Using methods like a 3D surface scanner, she reconstructed the object to reveal it was a tibia from an artiodactyl mammal, too large to be from a cow or sheep. The well-preserved bone, found in the Arctic, contained collagen indicating its age and preservation. After attending a conference in Bristol, Natalie learned about collagen fingerprinting technology from her colleague Mike Buckley. She sent him a bone fragment from the Arctic Circle, which was determined to be from a giant camel, larger than modern camels. Camels originated in North America before migrating to other parts of the world.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "Paleontologist Natalie Lichinski discovered bone fragments at an excavation site near the North Pole, which she painstakingly collected and pieced together over four years. Using methods like a 3D surface scanner, she reconstructed the object to reveal it was a tibia from an artiodactyl mammal, too large to be from a cow or sheep. The well-preserved bone, found in the Arctic, contained collagen indicating its age and preservation. After attending a conference in Bristol, Natalie learned about collagen fingerprinting technology from her colleague Mike Buckley. She sent him a bone fragment from the Arctic Circle, which was determined to be from a giant camel, larger than modern camels. Camels originated in North America before migrating to other parts of the world. The paragraph also discusses the variation in body sizes and features of camels, including long necks and noses, as well as their evolution into llamas and alpacas in South America. It mentions the extinction of camels in North America and the discovery of camels in a northern location, highlighting the extreme climate changes in the past and the challenging conditions camels faced in such environments.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "Paleontologist Natalie Lichinski discovered bone fragments at an excavation site near the North Pole, which she painstakingly collected and pieced together over four years. Using methods like a 3D surface scanner, she reconstructed the object to reveal it was a tibia from a giant camel, larger than modern camels. The well-preserved bone, found in the Arctic, contained collagen indicating its age and preservation. After attending a conference in Bristol, Natalie learned about collagen fingerprinting technology from her colleague Mike Buckley. She sent him a bone fragment from the Arctic Circle, which was determined to be from a giant camel. The paragraph also discusses the variation in body sizes and features of camels, including long necks and noses, as well as their evolution into llamas and alpacas in South America. Natalie and her colleagues propose a new theory that camels' characteristics evolved to survive harsh winters, not desert conditions, with humps storing fat for food scarcity during winter and potentially helping with heat dissipation. This theory suggests camels originated from the Arctic and adapted to desert environments, highlighting extreme climate changes in the past and the challenging conditions camels faced. The author sees this as a story about perception and how it changes over time, comparing it to the work of historians in understanding the past and predicting the future.",
