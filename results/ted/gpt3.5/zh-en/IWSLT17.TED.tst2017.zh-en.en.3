When I was in college, I majored in public administration, which meant I had to write a lot of papers.
When an ordinary student writes a paper, they may divide the task like this.
So, you understand that it may start a bit slow, but after a week, you have already written quite a bit, sometimes even more, and in the end, everything will be sorted out, and things won't go wrong.
I also want to do it this way.
At least, that's my plan.
I am ready to start, however, in fact, when it comes to writing papers, this is how I do it.
And this is how I write every time I write a paper.
When it came to writing a 90-page graduation thesis, the paper that should have taken a year to write.
I know that my usual approach won't work for a paper like this.
The graduation thesis is a big project.
So I made a plan and decided to do it this way.
One year's work is arranged like this.
At first, do a little less, do a bit more in the middle months, and then go all out in high gear at the end, just like climbing a small step.
How hard can climbing stairs be?
It's not a big deal, right?
But next, something interesting happened.
In the beginning, those first few months?
Coming and going, I basically didn't do anything.
So there was this great modification plan.
And then... The next few months just passed by like that, I basically didn't write a few words, so it turned out like this.
Then from two months left to one month left, and then only two weeks left.
Then one day, I suddenly realized that there were only three days left until the deadline, and I hadn't written a single word yet. So I did the only thing I could do: I spent 72 hours writing 90 pages, pulling two all-nighters in a row. People shouldn't stay up for two consecutive nights at full speed through the campus, sneaking in slow motion, and managed to submit the paper before the deadline.
I thought everything was over just like that.
A week later, I received a call from the school.
They asked, "Are you Tim Urban?"
I said, "That's right."
They said, "We need to talk to you about the paper."
I replied, "Okay."
The other party continued, "This is the best paper we have ever read."
(Applause) That did not happen.
This paper is written very, very poorly.
I just wanted to savor this moment when all of you think, "This guy is amazing!"
It's not like that, that paper is super terrible.
Regardless, I am now a blogger.
I wrote a blog post on "getting to the bottom of things."
A few years ago, I decided to write an article about procrastination.
My procrastination behavior always confuses those around me who do not procrastinate, so I want to explain to non-procrastinators what goes on in the minds of procrastinators and why we procrastinators behave this way.
My hypothesis is that the brain of a procrastinator is different from that of a non-procrastinator.
To prove this point, I found an MRI lab where I could scan my own brain and a brain confirmed not to be a procrastinator's, and then I could compare these two brains.
Today I brought them all.
I hope everyone can carefully compare whether there are any differences between the two.
I know that not everyone here is a trained brain science expert, so it may not be obvious, but let's take a look, shall we?
This is the brain of a non-procrastinator.
Now,
This is my brain.
There is a difference between the two.
Both types of brains have a rational decision-maker, but in the brain of a procrastinator, there is also a monkey called instant gratification.
What does this mean for procrastinators?
It means that everything was fine before this happened.
[Now is the best time to start working.] [No way!] So when the rational decision-maker makes a rational decision to do something productive, the monkey doesn't want to do it. So he takes control of the steering wheel and says, "Actually, let's read about the scandal of Nancy Kerrigan/Tonya Harding on Wikipedia because I just remembered it."
Then, let's walk to the refrigerator and see if there's anything new in the past 10 minutes.
After that, let's continue browsing on video websites, starting with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnetism, all the way to an interview with Justin Bieber's mom until the end of time.
"All of this takes time, so we can't find time to work on our schedule today."
I'm very sorry! "
What's going on here?
Instant gratification doesn't seem to be the person you want to control the steering wheel.
He lives completely in the moment.
He has no memories of the past, no knowledge of the future, he only cares about two things: simplicity and happiness.
In the animal world, this is not a problem.
If you are a dog, living a simple and happy life, you have already achieved great success!
As for the monkey, humans are another kind of animal.
Sleeping well, eating enough, and reproducing for the next generation may not be a problem in the tribal era.
However, if you haven't noticed, we are not living in the tribal era now.
We live in an advanced civilization, but the monkey has no idea what that is.
This is why we have another guy in our heads, the rational decision-maker, who enables us to do things that other animals cannot do.
We can foresee the future.
We can consider the overall situation.
We can make long-term plans.
And he wants to take all of these into consideration.
He wants us to do anything worth doing now.
Sometimes, doing simple and happy things is meaningful, such as eating, sleeping, or enjoying well-deserved leisure time.
This is why there is an overlap between the instant gratification monkey and the rational decision-maker.
Sometimes they are in agreement.
But sometimes, it is more meaningful to do things that are more difficult and less enjoyable, this is for the sake of the overall situation.
At this point, conflicts will arise between the two.
For procrastinators, each conflict ends in this way, where they spend a lot of time in the orange area, which is the simple and happy, but meaningless area.
I refer to this area as the dark playground.
The dark playground is a place that all procrastinators are very familiar with.
This is a leisure and entertainment venue where leisure activities take place when they shouldn't be happening.
The happiness obtained in the dark playground is not actually happiness, as it is entirely unearned, leading to feelings of guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-loathing, which are experienced by all procrastinators.
Moreover, the problem is that in this situation, with the monkey controlling the steering wheel, how can procrastinators steer themselves towards the blue area, which, although not as comfortable, has many important tasks to be done.
In fact, procrastinators have a guardian angel who always looks down on them and watches over them. In those darkest moments, it is known as the panic monster.
The panic monster spends most of its time hibernating, but it suddenly awakens when the deadline is approaching, when there is a risk of embarrassing oneself in public, facing career disasters, or other dreadful consequences.
And the important thing is, he is the only thing the monkey is afraid of.
Recently in my life, the panic monster has become quite important, because the TED staff contacted me 6 months ago, inviting me to give a speech.
Of course, I agreed.
I have always dreamed of giving a TED talk.
(Applause) But in this excitement, the rational decision-maker seems to be thinking about something else.
He will say, "Do we understand what we just agreed to?
Do we currently possess the ability to complete the task in the future?
"We need to sit down and start working."
And the monkey said, "I totally agree, but let's open Google Earth, zoom in 200 feet underground in India, and then spend two and a half hours scrolling up to the surface of this country, so we can better experience India."
That's exactly what I did that day.
As 6 months turned into 4 months, then 2 months, and then 1 month, the TED staff began announcing the speakers.
I opened the website and saw my face staring back at me.
Guess who woke up at this moment?
So the panic monster starts to go crazy, and a few seconds later, the whole system is in chaos.
And the monkey, do you remember? At the sound of the panic monster, he climbed up the tree!
Finally, the rational decision-maker can finally take the wheel, and I can start preparing for this speech.
In the eyes of the panic monster, all those rather foolish procrastination behaviors, like spending two weeks without being able to start writing the introduction of the thesis, miraculously resulted in an incredible burst of work enthusiasm, staying up all night to write 8 pages.
This entire situation, along with those three roles, constitutes the system of procrastinators.
Not good, but at least still useful.
This is something I decided to write on my blog a few years ago.
After the publication, the responses I received surprised me greatly.
I received thousands of emails from people all over the world, each doing various different things.
There were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and many, many doctoral students.
The content is basically the same: "I have this problem too."
But what impressed me the most was the contrast between the casual tone of the posts and the heavy tone of those emails.
These individuals feel a strong sense of frustration because procrastination affects their lives, as the monkey controls their thoughts.
After some thought, my question is: if the system of procrastinators can function, then what exactly is going on?
Why do these people all have such a dark corner?
As a result, I discovered that there are actually two types of procrastination.
The examples I mentioned today, as mentioned above, all have deadlines.
When there is a deadline, the impact of procrastination is limited to a relatively short period because the panic monster will intervene.
However, for the second type of procrastination, it occurs in situations without deadlines.
For example, if you want to start your own business or pursue a career in the arts, there is no initial deadline because nothing will happen until you start working hard, without any driving force to keep things moving forward.
Besides career-related matters, those important things also do not have deadlines, such as visiting your family, exercising to maintain physical health, making efforts to improve romantic relationships, or leaving an unsatisfactory relationship.
If procrastinators only have one mechanism to do these difficult things, which is the panic monster, then the problem arises because in these situations without deadlines, the panic monster simply will not appear.
He doesn't have a need to wake up, so the consequences of procrastination are unlimited, they will only keep postponing indefinitely.
And this long-term procrastination, compared to the more interesting, short-term, deadline-based procrastination, is not as obvious and is not often discussed.
It usually quietly and subtly affects us.
It may be a source of a significant amount of long-term unhappiness and guilt.
I think this is the reason why those people send emails, the reason why they are in such a terrible situation.
Not because they are rushing for a project,
It is this long-term procrastination that makes them feel like sometimes they are just spectators in their own lives.
Their frustration is not because they cannot achieve their dreams; it is because they cannot even start pursuing their dreams.
So after reading these emails, I had a realization that I believe there are no people who do not procrastinate.
Yes, I believe that we are all procrastinators.
You may not be as chaotic as we are in every aspect. Some people may be able to handle deadlines well, but please remember: the most despicable trick of the monkey lies in the part without deadlines.
Now I want to show everyone one last thing.
I call it the calendar of life.
Assuming a person can live to 90 years old, each week is a square.
In fact, there aren't many squares left, especially since we have already lived so many years.
I believe we all need to take some time to seriously look at this calendar of life.
We need to seriously consider what we are truly procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating on something.
We must always be aware of the presence of this instant gratification monkey.
This is something that all of us should do.
And because there aren't many squares left, perhaps this task should start from today.
Well, maybe not today, but...
You know.
In the near future.
Thank you.
