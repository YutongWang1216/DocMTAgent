They call for a reevaluation of the existing refugee system established after World War II, pointing out the failure of politicians to address the crisis in a humane manner. The current system is collapsing due to immigration policies blocking asylum seekers, leaving refugees trapped in indefinite stagnation. Countries close to conflicts bear the burden of receiving the majority of refugees, highlighting the need for shared responsibility. The perspective of individual refugees, like Amira from Syria, sheds light on the challenges faced by refugees and the limited options for resettlement. The paragraph also discusses the three options available to Syrian refugees, including going to a refugee camp, moving to a city in a neighboring country, or embarking on a dangerous journey to another country, each with its own challenges. The author believes that the current global refugee system presents refugees with an almost impossible choice and suggests that it should be reevaluated.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The author, feeling ashamed as a European, criticizes the inadequate response to the refugee crisis and the contradictions in European actions and values. They call for a reevaluation of the existing refugee system established after World War II, pointing out the failure of politicians to address the crisis in a humane manner. The current system is collapsing due to immigration policies blocking asylum seekers, leaving refugees trapped in indefinite stagnation. Countries close to conflicts bear the burden of receiving the majority of refugees, highlighting the need for shared responsibility. The perspective of individual refugees, like Amira from Syria, sheds light on the challenges faced by refugees and the limited options for resettlement, including going to a refugee camp, moving to a city in a neighboring country, or embarking on a dangerous journey to another country. The author believes that the current global refugee system presents refugees with an almost impossible choice and suggests that it should be reevaluated. Additionally, the paragraph discusses the misconception that refugees are a burden on society and presents the idea that refugees can make valuable contributions if given the opportunity. It highlights a research project in Uganda where refugees are provided with economic opportunities, resulting in the creation of businesses and employment for both refugees and nationals. By changing our perspective on refugees and providing them with opportunities, everyone can benefit.",

They highlight the failure of politicians to address the crisis in a humane manner, leading to refugees being trapped in indefinite stagnation. The perspective of individual refugees, like Amira from Syria, sheds light on the challenges they face and the limited options for resettlement. The author believes the current global refugee system presents refugees with an almost impossible choice and advocates for providing refugees with opportunities for long-term prosperity, such as access to education and work. The idea of establishing an economic zone near a refugee camp in Jordan to integrate refugees into the workforce and benefit both refugees and the host country is discussed, with the potential to contribute to the post-war reconstruction of Syria.",

The perspective of individual refugees, like Amira from Syria, sheds light on the challenges they face and the limited options for resettlement. The author advocates for providing refugees with opportunities for long-term prosperity, such as access to education and work, and discusses the idea of establishing an economic zone near a refugee camp in Jordan. Additionally, the implementation of a pilot project to match refugees with countries based on preferences, as advocated by economist Alvin Roth, and the concept of humanitarian visas to prevent unnecessary deaths during dangerous journeys to Europe are also discussed as potential solutions to the refugee crisis.",
