With the deadline approaching, they write the entire paper in 72 hours, resulting in a poor quality paper that leads them to become a blogger. Inspired by their experience, they decide to explore procrastination behavior by comparing brain scans of procrastinators and non-procrastinators. The difference in the brain of a procrastinator is highlighted, with the presence of an instant gratification monkey leading to distractions and hindering productivity by prioritizing instant gratification over rational decision-making. Procrastinators struggle to start working and often get sidetracked by irrelevant activities as the instant gratification monkey prioritizes simplicity and happiness, causing delays in completing tasks.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "A college student majoring in public administration initially plans to break down their 90-page graduation thesis into smaller tasks but ends up procrastinating for months. With the deadline approaching, they write the entire paper in 72 hours, resulting in a poor quality paper that leads them to become a blogger. Inspired by their experience, they decide to explore procrastination behavior by comparing brain scans of procrastinators and non-procrastinators. The difference in the brain of a procrastinator is highlighted, with the presence of an instant gratification monkey leading to distractions and hindering productivity by prioritizing instant gratification over rational decision-making. Procrastinators struggle to start working and often get sidetracked by irrelevant activities as the instant gratification monkey prioritizes simplicity and happiness, causing delays in completing tasks. The paragraph discusses the concept of the instant gratification monkey and the rational decision-maker in our heads, which represent our desire for immediate pleasure versus our ability to make long-term plans. It explains how conflicts between these two can lead to procrastination, where individuals spend time in a \"dark playground\" engaging in leisure activities instead of completing meaningful tasks.",

Procrastinators struggle to start working and often get sidetracked by irrelevant activities, spending time in a \"dark playground\" instead of completing tasks. The paragraph also discusses the negative emotions associated with procrastination, such as guilt, fear, and anxiety, as well as the concept of a \"panic monster\" that awakens procrastinators when deadlines approach.

        "new_tgt_summary": "A college student majoring in public administration procrastinates on their 90-page graduation thesis, leading to writing the entire paper in 72 hours and becoming a blogger. Inspired by their experience, they explore procrastination behavior by comparing brain scans of procrastinators and non-procrastinators. The presence of an instant gratification monkey in the brain of a procrastinator leads to distractions and hinders productivity by prioritizing instant gratification over rational decision-making. Procrastinators struggle to start working and often get sidetracked by irrelevant activities, spending time in a \"dark playground\" instead of completing tasks. The paragraph also discusses the negative emotions associated with procrastination, such as guilt, fear, and anxiety, as well as the concept of a \"panic monster\" that awakens procrastinators when deadlines approach. The author shares a personal experience of preparing for a TED talk and the internal struggle between procrastination and the rational decision-maker. The system of procrastinators is discussed, where behaviors like procrastination can lead to bursts of work enthusiasm. The author received responses from people all over the world who struggle with procrastination, with some feeling frustrated as the monkey (procrastination) controls their thoughts. The author questions why some people have a dark corner due to procrastination, and identifies two types of procrastination - one with deadlines and one without. The panic monster only intervenes in situations with deadlines, leading to unlimited consequences in situations without deadlines.",

        "new_tgt_summary": "The paragraph discusses a college student procrastinating on their 90-page thesis, leading to writing it in 72 hours and becoming a blogger. Inspired by this experience, the student explores procrastination behavior by comparing brain scans of procrastinators and non-procrastinators. The presence of an instant gratification monkey in the brain of a procrastinator leads to distractions and hindered productivity. Procrastinators struggle to start working and often get sidetracked by irrelevant activities, spending time in a \"dark playground.\" The negative emotions associated with procrastination, such as guilt and anxiety, are discussed, as well as the concept of a \"panic monster\" that awakens procrastinators when deadlines approach. Long-term procrastination is also addressed, emphasizing the importance of considering what we are procrastinating on and the limited time we have left to pursue our goals. The author urges readers to take action and be aware of the instant gratification monkey that leads to procrastination.",
